17
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:54,570
of opinions about controversial social

18
00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:57,480
and political issues even though I'm

19
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:59,789
trans I refuse to be a victim because I

20
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:01,440
prefer to take control of my own life

21
00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:05,210
which is why I support our president

00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:08,210

of the political spectrum but I've

33
00:01:43,869 --> 00:01:47,829
brought them here together to engage in

34
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:56,289
a rational free thinking debate about a

35
00:01:47,829 --> 00:01:58,420
timeless question our traps gay my first

Clarence hey YouTube it's you girl

Adriana have you ever considered that

40
00:02:05,979 --> 00:02:12,160
transphobia is racist

41
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:14,769

00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,660
show it's Tiffany chuckles now Tiffany

43
00:02:14,769 --> 00:02:17,769
you've had a major change of heart since

44
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:19,720
the last time you were on this program

45
00:02:17,769 --> 00:02:21,790
isn't that right that's right Jackie

46
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:24,819
it's pretty embarrassing but I used to

47
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:26,230
be a non-binary sjw you poor thing could

48
00:02:24,819 --> 00:02:28,690
you say a little bit about how you came

49
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:30,280
to take the red pill well I posted a

50
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:32,320
couple tweets about how there are only

51
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:33,549
two genders and how I was tired of

52
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:36,310
trendy teens who don't experience

53
00:02:33,549 --> 00:02:38,380
dysphoria calling themselves trans and

54
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:40,540
next thing I know everyone's calling me

55
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:42,700
a turf and a traitor so I said you know

56
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:44,829
what I'm out I'm not gonna put up with

57
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:47,739
this culture of silencing and shame I

58
00:02:44,829 --> 00:02:49,989
think it's just so brave of you yeah Wow

59
00:02:47,739 --> 00:02:51,970
so brave of you to come on talk shows to

60
00:02:49,989 --> 00:02:54,489
discuss how silenced you are shut up

61
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:55,810
Adriana I had just come out as trans and

62
00:02:54,489 --> 00:02:58,030
I was putting myself out there online

63
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:59,920
and then like that the trans community

64
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:01,569
dropped me like a piece of trash and I

65
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,489
had no support nothing

66
00:03:01,569 --> 00:03:05,709
I was absolutely alone do you have any

67
00:03:03,489 --> 00:03:08,019
idea what that felt like your leftist

68
00:03:05,709 --> 00:03:10,060
allies are not your friends adrià one

69
00:03:08,019 --> 00:03:11,980
wrong move and you're dead to them those

70
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:13,810
are not friends well you have real

71
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:15,609
friends now Tiffany I think you're gonna

72
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:17,680
fit right in with this new group of

73
00:03:15,609 --> 00:03:19,359
dangerous intellectuals who are finally

74
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,069
taking a stand against the authoritarian

75
00:03:19,359 --> 00:03:23,200
left and speaking out against

76
00:03:21,069 --> 00:03:24,489
politically correct dogma why don't we

77
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,859
go ahead and roll a clip of one of

78
00:03:24,489 --> 00:03:28,959
Tiffany's newest videos so I'm gonna go

79
00:03:26,859 --> 00:03:29,990
in with a highlighter pop it on my

80
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:33,310
cheeks

81
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:37,370
pop it on my brow till I'm literally

82
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:41,030
blinding I am glowing hmm she's doing

83
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:43,880
alright but I'm not living for it you

84
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:44,690
know what else I'm not living for the

85
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:48,230
Muslims

86
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:50,000
Tiffany you are so funny I'm sorry are

87
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:52,220
we just gonna ignore the blatant racism

88
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,590
I was that racist Muslim is a religion

89
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:56,510
not a race yeah adrià Muslim is a

90
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:58,370
religion not a race well in this country

91
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:58,970
Islam and race are inextricably tied

92
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:01,280
together

93
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:03,080
you can't just well you both know

94
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:06,820
exactly what I'm talking about let's try

95
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:09,890
to get back on track here so adrià craps

96
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:11,360
are they gay look there's so many things

97
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:13,640
wrong with the question that the only

98
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,770
way to answer is to deconstruct it first

99
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:17,180
of all what are traps are they trans

100
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:19,070
women because if you're calling trans

101
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:20,510
women traps then you're directly playing

102
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:22,760
into the lie that trans women are

103
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:24,890
tricking or trapping men a lie that

104
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:26,780
reinforces the mentality that causes men

105
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:28,640
to murder us well I don't think trout

106
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:30,800
does necessarily a trans woman what

107
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:32,810
about anime okay so the word trap was

108
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,060
invented by english-speaking anime fans

109
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:36,920
the japanese word is otokonoko which

110
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:39,080
just means a male crossdresser there's

111
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:41,150
no implication of tricking men but the

112
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:43,160
word trap is sometimes used in English

113
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:44,570
as a slur against trans women so when

114
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:46,130
you tell us that's not what it means

115
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:47,450
you're gaslighting the [ __ ] out of us

116
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:49,130
because we've all heard it used as a

117
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:51,230
slur adrià you don't get to speak for

118
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:53,210
all trans women we're not all offended

119
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:54,440
all the time I actually happen to

120
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:56,960
identify as a trap

121
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:59,330
yeah Adria she identifies as a trap well

122
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:01,040
she's in the second place and Tiffany

123
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:02,720
that's pretty reckless doesn't it bother

124
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:04,640
you at all that if some guy murders you

125
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,440
his defense is gonna be well she was a

126
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:08,120
trap I was tricked and you'll have

127
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:09,860
contributed to that way of thinking what

128
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:13,010
do you care Adria no one's gonna be

129
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:15,980
trapped by you anyway Oh spicy my [ __ ]

130
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:17,540
did you just say I said no shade but you

131
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:18,830
don't really look like a woman Jackie

132
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:20,960
are you going to allow your guest to

133
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:23,000
talk to me like this well Tiffany you

134
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:25,190
could stand to be a little nicer look

135
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,250
dragging [ __ ] is what I do

136
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:30,020
fax over feels hunty Wow Adrian don't

137
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:31,550
you think she has a bit of a point look

138
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:33,560
if you want to be taken seriously you

139
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:35,840
could put a little more effort in I mean

140
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:37,910
what is this a men's shirt how are you

141
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:40,610
gonna attract men with that I'm not

142
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:41,960
trying to attract men I'm a lesbian

143
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:43,980
I'm sorry maybe this is a stupid

144
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:47,730
question but how can you be

145
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:50,490
trans woman and a lesbian well I'm a

146
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:52,890
woman and I like women I don't know

147
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:54,300
about that sounds debatable I'm sorry I

148
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:55,530
didn't realize when I agreed to do this

149
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:58,200
show that I was signing up for the

150
00:05:55,530 --> 00:06:00,810
transphobia special transphobia

151
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:03,300
well Adria I think that's very unfair I

152
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:05,340
mean I've invited two trans women to be

153
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:07,320
on my program and all how do you know

154
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:09,570
that one of my best friends happens to

155
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:12,150
be a gay man and what could be

156
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:13,710
transphobic about that see Adria you're

157
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:15,840
the reason why everyone hates trans

158
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:17,310
people you're obnoxious and offended by

159
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,050
everything and everyone feels like they

160
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:20,910
have to try not a comes around you Thank

161
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:21,300
You Tiffany see you're one of the good

162
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:23,220
ones

163
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:24,900
you're a good Tran is this what you want

164
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:27,660
to do with your life Tiffany be the

165
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:29,250
lapdog of people like this no I want to

166
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:30,990
actually work toward the acceptance of

167
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:33,000
trans people by being patient in

168
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:35,010
agreeable and by looking the part

169
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,790
and not by screeching transphobia at

170
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:37,590
everyone who doesn't meet your

171
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:39,300
impossible standard of woek nests and

172
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:41,520
you're gonna do that by identifying as a

173
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:43,440
trap huh just keep reinforcing and

174
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,180
excusing bigotry until it magically goes

175
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,860
away well does it occur to you Tiffany

176
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:47,850
that you're not gaining acceptance for

177
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:49,440
anyone but yourself

178
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:50,700
and the only reason you're accepted is

179
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,290
that you don't challenge the status quo

180
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:54,060
I'm sorry I need to interrupt this

181
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:54,930
exchange of ideas because I feel like

182
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:57,330
we're just getting hung up on

183
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:59,160
terminology look Adria if you don't like

184
00:06:57,330 --> 00:07:01,800
the word trap we just won't use the word

185
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:03,780
trap the real question is is it gay to

186
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:06,170
be attracted to trans women it is if

187
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:08,880
you're a woman no I mean for men like

188
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:11,250
Tiffany duty the straight man or gay man

189
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:14,310
well all the men I've dated only date

190
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:16,500
women but if they're attracted to me I

191
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:17,610
mean it's not the straightest thing is

192
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,440
it why not

193
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:21,510
you look like a woman and I know that

194
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,380
you know that gay men are not attracted

195
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:24,950
to these tits

196
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:27,090
well I am serving up fishy realness so

197
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:29,520
granted well doesn't she have a point

198
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:32,310
though Adria I mean sure she looks like

199
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:33,630
a woman but she does have XY chromosomes

200
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:35,910
when was the last time you were

201
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:37,800
attracted to a person's chromosomes the

202
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:39,330
thoughtful sexuality works we're

203
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:41,730
attracted to a person's perceptible

204
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:44,070
feature is not molecular biology okay

205
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:46,380
sure but I mean a lot of trans women

206
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:49,170
still have their penis and you got to

207
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:50,880
admit that seems kind of gay Jackie you

208
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:52,710
really have no clue what you're doing do

209
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:54,420
you we live in a world where there's no

210
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:56,550
shortage of men who want to date trans

211
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:57,180
women but there's an intense stigma on

212
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:58,650
dating

213
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:00,690
women and it's actually dangerous

214
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:02,370
because what happens is if a man's

215
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:04,320
friends find out that the woman he's

216
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:06,780
dating his trans he may try to preserve

217
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:08,460
as toxic masculine dignity by lashing

218
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:10,380
out violently against the trans woman

219
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:12,360
he's dating and this happens again and

220
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:14,070
again and every time you suggest that

221
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:15,840
dating a trans woman is gay you're

222
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:17,340
adding to that stigma and you're making

223
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,080
the world a more dangerous and violent

224
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:20,970
place for trans women all right I'm not

225
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:23,250
trying to use violent words or whatever

226
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:24,630
I just don't understand who a person

227
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:26,820
who's attracted to women could be

228
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:29,220
attracted to a person with a penis well

229
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:31,139
if you want to know I'll tell you I am a

230
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:33,149
lesbian I'm only attracted to women

231
00:08:31,139 --> 00:08:35,159
including trans women and what I'm

232
00:08:33,149 --> 00:08:37,440
attracted to a trans woman I perceive

233
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:39,659
her as a woman and if she has a penis I

234
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:42,390
perceive it not in isolation but as a

235
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:44,910
part of her female body so I perceive it

236
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:46,320
not as a male penis but as a girl dick

237
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:49,050
I'm sorry what

238
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:52,770
what does girl dick the feminine penis

239
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:55,170
oh no oh come on this is nonsense how

240
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:56,910
could a penis possibly be feminine well

241
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:58,770
it's feminine because it's on a woman

242
00:08:56,910 --> 00:09:01,230
but also because hormones actually

243
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:04,980
change the anatomy and functionality of

244
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:07,320
the penis shut up adrià just shut hobby

245
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:09,209
really how is it different well I'm glad

246
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:11,430
you asked more needs to be said about

247
00:09:09,209 --> 00:09:13,920
the feminine penis why is no one talking

248
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:15,480
about the feminine penis kill me now

249
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,839
also to start with it doesn't get us

250
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:18,000
hard

251
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:20,220
it doesn't really ejaculate and it has a

252
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,930
different mouthfeel can we please talk

253
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:24,779
about the mouthfeel why has no one

254
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:26,670
talking about the mouthfeel I don't

255
00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:28,500
think that's necessary I'm just trying

256
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:31,890
to wrap my head around this you are

257
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:33,029
attracted to women with dicks but not to

258
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:35,520
men that's correct

259
00:09:33,029 --> 00:09:38,040
I don't like man take its course and

260
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:40,860
rough and irritating and it comes

261
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:43,589
everywhere not like girl tech girl dick

262
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:45,839
is everything soft and smooth is that

263
00:09:43,589 --> 00:09:48,450
Star Wars that do you also build

264
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:51,890
computers for a living I mean guilty I

265
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:51,890
also enjoy wearing knee socks

266
00:09:52,329 --> 00:09:57,679
and let me guess your girlfriend is a

267
00:09:54,829 --> 00:10:00,019
communist cat girl my sweet love wait

268
00:09:57,679 --> 00:10:01,910
you're dating my crazy aunt Eva cat well

269
00:10:00,019 --> 00:10:02,540
we're on the same poly fuel I don't know

270
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:04,309
what that means

271
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:06,949
and I'm not like prejudiced or anything

272
00:10:04,309 --> 00:10:09,529
but I'm just not sold on this idea of

273
00:10:06,949 --> 00:10:11,989
trans lesbianism like if you're a born

274
00:10:09,529 --> 00:10:14,809
male and you're attracted to women how

275
00:10:11,989 --> 00:10:17,360
is it not just heterosexuality well my

276
00:10:14,809 --> 00:10:20,059
girlfriend is also trans so if you

277
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:24,559
follow your logic to its conclusion okay

278
00:10:20,059 --> 00:10:28,809
so you're a woman who was born a man and

279
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:32,149
you like women but you're dating a woman

280
00:10:28,809 --> 00:10:34,610
who has a penis are the female penis

281
00:10:32,149 --> 00:10:37,749
that used to be a male penis so you're a

282
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:41,329
rare woman with it but you're not a man

283
00:10:37,749 --> 00:10:43,519
and your tract has a penis why that used

284
00:10:41,329 --> 00:10:44,209
to be a man you're dating a female who

285
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:47,299
has a penis

286
00:10:44,209 --> 00:10:49,519
so that means you are gay but you're gay

287
00:10:47,299 --> 00:10:50,929
in the opposite way how's the kind of

288
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:52,790
gay that you like go over it with you

289
00:10:50,929 --> 00:10:54,860

290
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:57,199
extra time to figure it out what am i

sorry to break it to you the world is

295
00:11:03,559 --> 00:11:07,249
not ready to hear about trans lesbianism

296
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:09,139
what trans people need right now is

297
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:10,879
people like you to keep a low profile

298
00:11:09,139 --> 00:11:12,860
and people like me to be our

299
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:15,290
representatives because I act like a

300
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:16,970
normal woman and I date normal men and I

301
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:19,939

for transpeople

360
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:57,110
