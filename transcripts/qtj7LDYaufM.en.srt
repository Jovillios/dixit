5
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:48,730
one hello darkness hello children

6
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:52,239
it is I the darkness within so you know

7
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:53,860
how life is like kind of bad well what

8
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:55,600
are you gonna do about that hmm I mean

9
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:58,180
there's a few things you can do first

10
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,949
you could work to improve yourself and

11
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:01,860
make the world a better place that's

12
00:00:59,949 --> 00:01:04,809
probably the most effective approach

13
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:06,820
eventually but the problem is that it's

14
00:01:04,809 --> 00:01:10,990
hard and I don't like things that are

15
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:13,509
hard because when you do things that are

16
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:15,009
hard you have to feel bad now so that

17
00:01:13,509 --> 00:01:17,110
you can feel good later

18
00:01:15,009 --> 00:01:19,570
and I don't want to feel good later I

19
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:21,670
want to feel good now and if you want to

20
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:24,520
feel good now well you have a couple

21
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:26,979
options the first is of course to do

22
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:29,080
drugs and I've tried that I spent most

23
00:01:26,979 --> 00:01:31,330
of my 20s on the threshold of alcoholism

24
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:34,060
but it turns out that's not a cute look

25
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:36,340
for me it's not my vibe so what I do now

26
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:38,950
when I feel the darkness coming is what

27
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:41,649
any respectable woman would do I take a

28
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:42,070
xanax and lie on the floor for a couple

29
00:01:41,649 --> 00:01:44,470
hours

30
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:46,959
is that a pee under my mattress your

31
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:48,970
majesty or is it another xanax I left

32
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:50,500
under the throw rug now the problem with

33
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:53,440
doing drugs is that when the drugs wear

34
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:56,229
off you feel bad again in fact you

35
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:56,860
probably feel worse so where do we go

36
00:01:56,229 --> 00:02:00,970
from here

37
00:01:56,860 --> 00:02:03,250
well how about music you feel bad you

38
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:06,819
want to listen to sad music because sad

39
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:07,780
music makes you cry and crying feels

40
00:02:06,819 --> 00:02:10,539
good

41
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:12,400
it's like an orgasm for sad people and

42
00:02:10,539 --> 00:02:14,650
why settle for less than the official

43
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:17,080
meme song of sadness the sound of

44
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:19,540
silence by Simon and Garfunkel you know

45
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:22,780
I'm pretty sure there's another xanax

46
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:24,260
under this throw rug hello darkness my

47
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:26,569
old friend

48
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:28,189
but in the memes you only hear the first

49
00:02:26,569 --> 00:02:29,989
10 seconds of the song

50
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:32,209
you only hear hello darkness my old

51
00:02:29,989 --> 00:02:34,549
friend and that's the very sad first 10

52
00:02:32,209 --> 00:02:36,049
seconds of a song which is good because

53
00:02:34,549 --> 00:02:38,900
if you're making songs for sad people

54
00:02:36,049 --> 00:02:42,200
it's important to establish your sadness

55
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:45,560
cred up front because sad people don't

56
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:47,360
like happy songs when you're sad happy

57
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:49,970
songs make you feel like you're being

58
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,620
[ __ ] and so we're ten seconds into

59
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:54,859
the song hello darkness my old friend

60
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:56,870
the key is d sharp minor the saddest

61
00:02:54,859 --> 00:02:58,849
with all keys but when we get to the

62
00:02:56,870 --> 00:03:02,170
next line because of vision softly

63
00:02:58,849 --> 00:03:07,700
creeping something happens let's listen

64
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:12,879
come to talk with you again because a

65
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:16,280
vision softly creeping ah what was that

66
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:18,349
suddenly a major chord an unsuspected

67
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:20,959
burst of sunlight through the clouds and

68
00:03:18,349 --> 00:03:23,620
every peach fuzz hair on the back of my

69
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:27,109
biologically female knack stands on and

70
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:29,090
halel eyes so the song has enticed me

71
00:03:27,109 --> 00:03:32,090
with its promise of company for misery

72
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:34,669
and then it has tricked me into feeling

73
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:36,500
good and that's what I like about art it

74
00:03:34,669 --> 00:03:39,109
takes the standard disappointments and

75
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:40,400
humiliations of life and cooks them into

76
00:03:39,109 --> 00:03:42,470
something worth getting off the floor

77
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:45,049
for unfortunately I don't really play

78
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:46,669
music much anymore because my hands are

79
00:03:45,049 --> 00:03:48,530
too beautiful for instruments and my

80
00:03:46,669 --> 00:03:50,900
singing voice sounds like a man so all I

81
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:53,720
really have left is what any aspiring

82
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:56,870
artist with no talent turns to comedy

83
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:58,760
and I especially like dark comedy you

84
00:03:56,870 --> 00:04:01,220
know comedy about the things in life

85
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:03,470
that are the most painful to me dark

86
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:05,359
humor is kind of like a sad song it

87
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:07,669
takes your worst feelings traumas and

88
00:04:05,359 --> 00:04:09,919
anxieties and twists them into a source

89
00:04:07,669 --> 00:04:12,889
of pleasure and don't all the finest

90
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:15,049
pleasures come from pain ah a lot of the

91
00:04:12,889 --> 00:04:17,209
time that means joking about topics that

92
00:04:15,049 --> 00:04:20,120
an ordinary life are considered taboo

93
00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:21,440
you know sadness fascism sexual

94
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:23,570
deviation cult

95
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:25,280
without the ability to joke and make fun

96
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:27,830
of my own experiences of self-loathing

97
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,550
substance abuse gender dysphoria

98
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:29,780
I mean

99
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:32,569
probably be on the floor right now

100
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:34,490
looking for that xanax but this puts me

101
00:04:32,569 --> 00:04:36,139
in a difficult situation because I

102
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:37,699
wanted to defend my sense of humor which

103
00:04:36,139 --> 00:04:39,949
I feel is like the core of my

104
00:04:37,699 --> 00:04:42,110
personality and what keeps me alive but

105
00:04:39,949 --> 00:04:43,729
at the same time I've noticed that a lot

106
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:45,650
of the people in our culture who are

107
00:04:43,729 --> 00:04:47,720
really big on defending provocative

108
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:52,550
controversial politically incorrect

109
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:54,979
comedy are kind of dick nuggets let's

110
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:57,500
discuss this and by discuss I mean you

111
00:04:54,979 --> 00:05:01,699
said quietly and I'll tell you what to

112
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:04,370
think - dick nuggets so the year 2016

113
00:05:01,699 --> 00:05:06,139
had just begun and already the most 2016

114
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:09,110
possible thing was happening Ricky

115
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:11,330
Gervais is an irreverent bad-boy atheist

116
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:13,669
comedian was ranting on Twitter for days

117
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:16,039
and days about how stupid it is that

118
00:05:13,669 --> 00:05:17,780
people are offended by things this is

119
00:05:16,039 --> 00:05:19,880
pretty standard for Ricky Gervais a man

120
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:22,219
whose personal branding screams I don't

121
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:24,409
care about your feelings I know what

122
00:05:22,219 --> 00:05:27,259
it's like to be persecuted for my

123
00:05:24,409 --> 00:05:29,900
beliefs I'm too much of a badass rebel

124
00:05:27,259 --> 00:05:32,780
to care what minorities thing but in

125
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:35,960
January 2016 Ricky Gervais was having an

126
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:39,889
extra badass irreverent not caring about

127
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:42,199
your feelings kind of moms why because

128
00:05:39,889 --> 00:05:44,090
he just hosted the Golden Globes and

129
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:47,090
upset a bunch of people by telling jokes

130
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:48,650
about all Tran ma Caitlyn Jenner as I

131
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:52,120
say I'm gonna be nice tonight I've

132
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:54,889
changed not as much as Bruce Jenner

133
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:57,440
obviously that's cutting edge material

134
00:05:54,889 --> 00:06:01,219
there Rick very irreverent very

135
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:02,630
rebellious very bad boy atheist I mean I

136
00:06:01,219 --> 00:06:04,969
do wish you wouldn't dead name trans

137
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:07,219
people on stage but honestly the joke

138
00:06:04,969 --> 00:06:09,050
wasn't even as transphobic as a lot of

139
00:06:07,219 --> 00:06:11,330
the stuff I've come to just expect from

140
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:13,880
comics still I'm sure Twitter had a

141
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:15,349
thing or two to say about it and Ricky

142
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:17,120
spent the rest of the month tweeting

143
00:06:15,349 --> 00:06:19,279
about how offending people is good

144
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,110
actually and he definitely doesn't care

145
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:23,029
that people were offended but clearly

146
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:25,400
Twitter got to him because two years

147
00:06:23,029 --> 00:06:27,800
later he opened his Netflix special with

148
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:29,800
a 13-minute bit rehashing the incident

149
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:32,810
and doing a series of even more

150
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:35,509
irreverent jokes cuz I've always

151
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:35,990
identified as a chimp right well I am a

152
00:06:35,509 --> 00:06:38,330
chimp

153
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:40,480
i if I sandwich him I am a chimp pre-op

154
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:43,460
but

155
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:44,990
and don't ever dead name me don't ever

156
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:47,570
call we ricky gervais is again from now

157
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:50,060
on you call me Bobo does he also

158
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:52,520
identify as an attack helicopter does he

159
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:54,440
realize he is doing a meme from 2014 on

160
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:56,420
stage and a 20 million dollar comedy

161
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:58,400
special my issue with this joke is that

162
00:06:56,420 --> 00:07:00,740
apart from being extremely passe and

163
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,450
overdone it also doesn't make sense

164
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:04,610
unless you ignorant ly believe that

165
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:07,280
trans women are delusional men and even

166
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:10,280
then it's just not very funny but am i

167
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:12,830
offended by the joke well I think it's

168
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:15,590
ignorant misinformed unoriginal and not

169
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:17,870
very funny and as a great comedian named

170
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:20,090
Ricky Gervais once said to me an

171
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:23,060
offensive joke is the one that's lame

172
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:26,030
badly delivered and not funny enough so

173
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:28,520
by that measure yes I'd say this idea as

174
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:30,020
a chimp bit is pretty offensive but I'm

175
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:31,940
not bringing this old controversy up

176
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:33,590
because I'm offended I'm bringing it up

177
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:35,810
because it's just an arbitrary example

178
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:38,510
of a cycle it seems like our culture

179
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:39,170
repeats about once a week somebody makes

180
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:41,180
a joke

181
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:43,100
some people are offended by the joke and

182
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:44,960
other people are indignant about the

183
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:47,090
fact that those people are offended the

184
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:49,220
cycle usually gets framed as a battle in

185
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:51,470
a culture war that's supposedly going on

186
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:53,840
between generations snowflake easily

187
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:55,910
triggered humorless PZ Cox and badass

188
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:58,190
edgy nothing off-limits free speech

189
00:07:55,910 --> 00:08:00,890
truth tellers now if this really is a

190
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:03,470
culture war between two sides than I am

191
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:06,050
a double agent because I'm a generation

192
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:08,450
snowflake PC cuck who loves dank edgy

193
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:10,820
memes and I found myself on both sides

194
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:12,890
of this type of conflict many many times

195
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:14,630
so on the one hand when I see the

196
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:16,940
internet roasting a comedian for some

197
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:19,910
shitty trans joke my inner snowflake

198
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:22,160
wants to watch the bastard burn but my

199
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:24,230
inner edge lady knows how it feels to be

200
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,030
dragged across Twitter over a joke and

201
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:28,010
as someone who basically writes jokes

202
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:30,860
about controversial topics for a living

203
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:34,130
I appreciate how difficult it is to

204
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:37,280
maintain the mildly sadomasochistic

205
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:39,080
character of comedy while also keeping

206
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:41,780
your moral compass from getting too

207
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:44,090
jittery so what I want to try to do is

208
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:46,520
step away from the heat of these social

209
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:47,209
media battles and try to abstract from

210
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:49,220
them

211
00:08:47,209 --> 00:08:51,769
more general philosophical questions

212
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:54,019
what is the purpose of comedy what is it

213
00:08:51,769 --> 00:08:56,600
that makes comedy good or bad does good

214
00:08:54,019 --> 00:08:58,550
comedy punch up and speak truth to power

215
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:00,949
does it bring light to some aspect of

216
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:03,470
the human condition is it as Aristotle

217
00:09:00,949 --> 00:09:06,379
said the imitation of worse than average

218
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:08,720
German or is it simply anything anyone

219
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:09,889
laughs at for whatever reason well I

220
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,839
don't think there's a single objective

221
00:09:09,889 --> 00:09:14,059
answer I mean comedy is pretty

222
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:16,069
subjective but we can probably reach

223
00:09:14,059 --> 00:09:19,579
some kind of understanding by discussing

224
00:09:16,069 --> 00:09:21,949
this right and by we again I I do mean

225
00:09:19,579 --> 00:09:22,850
me the rest of you can keep your goddamn

226
00:09:21,949 --> 00:09:26,929
mouth shut

227
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:28,730
free straw man so as a trans woman up

228
00:09:26,929 --> 00:09:30,800
here discussing why I don't think Ricky

229
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:32,749
Gervais is trans jokes are funny a lot

230
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,939
of haters and losers out there are

231
00:09:32,749 --> 00:09:40,399
probably gonna try to strawman me did

232
00:09:34,939 --> 00:09:42,350
you just assume the straw person says

233
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:44,959
people have liked to trans jokes and

234
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:48,350
they're both so bad here's the straw

235
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:50,269
person's [ __ ] straw person one you

236
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:52,519
hate free speech and are trying to

237
00:09:50,269 --> 00:09:55,129
silence comedians I'm not trying to

238
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:57,499
silence anyone comedians can say

239
00:09:55,129 --> 00:10:00,230
whatever they want on stage and I can

240
00:09:57,499 --> 00:10:02,749
say whatever I want about them straw

241
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:05,600
person - you just can't take the heat

242
00:10:02,749 --> 00:10:07,549
when the joke's on you I transitioned on

243
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:10,879
YouTube making controversial political

244
00:10:07,549 --> 00:10:13,939
content all the while and I read the

245
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:16,549
comments my hate taking capacity is

246
00:10:13,939 --> 00:10:18,170
among the highest of all time of course

247
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:19,970
I do not have the internalized

248
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:21,529
self-loathing that has damaged my psyche

249
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:24,920
irreparably but sweetie

250
00:10:21,529 --> 00:10:26,269
who doesn't strawperson 3 you think no

251
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:29,509
one should be allowed to joke about

252
00:10:26,269 --> 00:10:31,459
trans people I invented joking about

253
00:10:29,509 --> 00:10:34,549
trans people never heard of the

254
00:10:31,459 --> 00:10:37,189
mouthfeel I'm that tram that's right if

255
00:10:34,549 --> 00:10:39,379
I die tomorrow my legacy will be that I

256
00:10:37,189 --> 00:10:42,529
applied wine-tasting terminology -

257
00:10:39,379 --> 00:10:44,660
fellatio and I accept my

258
00:10:42,529 --> 00:10:47,269
look half my job is telling jokes about

259
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:48,890
trans people I live for trans jokes I

260
00:10:47,269 --> 00:10:50,839
just don't think this is people are very

261
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:52,550
good at telling them because they don't

262
00:10:50,839 --> 00:10:54,320
know enough about trans people to know

263
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:56,149
what the funny things are and being

264
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,250
transgender is honestly the perfect

265
00:10:56,149 --> 00:11:00,110
topic for comedy like you used to live

266
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:02,329
as one gender and then you became a

267
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:04,940
different gender every single thing

268
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:07,130
about that it's absolutely hilarious but

269
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:08,510
humor is in the details and Ricky

270
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:10,640
Gervais does not know the details

271
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:12,589
because he's clearly never been close to

272
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:14,720
a trans person and that's why he's still

273
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:16,910
telling these Tinkertoy 2015 caitlyn

274
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,350
jenner jokes and it's too bad cuz I'm

275
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:20,360
actually starving over here for good

276
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:22,070
trans comedy and I mean the real dark

277
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:23,570
stuff - I'm not talking about trans

278
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:25,940
Rachel on the timeline calling her

279
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:28,310
hormones teddy skittles no I like the

280
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:31,279
edgy stuff I like being on the edge hi

281
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:34,370
my name is Natalie win and I enjoy

282
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:36,230
edging now there is one recent work of

283
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:38,060
trans comedy that I'd like to share with

284
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:40,100
you because when you're doing art

285
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:41,779
criticism it helps to have positive as

286
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:44,600
well as negative examples and the

287
00:11:41,779 --> 00:11:46,190
exemplary work I have in mind is one not

288
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:48,470
a lot of people are talking about yet

289
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:50,329
but which I have no qualms placing in

290
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:52,940
the same company as the works of Dante

291
00:11:50,329 --> 00:11:55,459
or Swift I am of course referring to my

292
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:57,500
sperm bank experience by Gigi gorgeous

293
00:11:55,459 --> 00:11:58,820
if you don't know how gigi is first of

294
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:00,500
all who even are you do you have no

295
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:02,990
respect for Legends she's a trans

296
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:05,209
youtuber like the trans youtuber whose

297
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:08,060
classic works such as my hemorrhoids and

298
00:12:05,209 --> 00:12:10,220
I had sex with a dog long ago cemented

299
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:12,410
her status as a comedy icon

300
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:14,959
but in this critics opinion the crown

301
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:17,450
jewel of Gigi's OVA is without a doubt

302
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:20,000
the singular masterpiece my sperm bank

303
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:23,060
experience let's do a close reading for

304
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Gigi's sperm bank experienced a great

305
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:27,860
work of literature is never just a text

306
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,199
it is also what the theorist Jean

307
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:33,079
Jacques visage dupa saw would call a

308
00:12:30,199 --> 00:12:35,480
moment within an intertextual dialectic

309
00:12:33,079 --> 00:12:37,550
love that let us therefore place my

310
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:40,040
sperm bank experience within its proper

311
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:41,720
context several months earlier Gigi had

312
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:43,310
released a video about how she and her

313
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:45,769
girlfriend were trying to have a child

314
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:47,600
so far without success and so they went

315
00:12:45,769 --> 00:12:49,520
to see a fertility specialist

316
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,530
apparently gigi was not aware that

317
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:53,870
taking feminizing hormones can make you

318
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:55,790
sterile which Carl they tell you like

319
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:58,700
seven times before you start hormones

320
00:12:55,790 --> 00:13:00,410
like how well move past it a few months

321
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:02,330
later the notification from my sperm

322
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:03,980
bank experience shows up on my phone

323
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:05,870
because that's right I clicked the bell

324
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:07,670
and immediately I knew I was about to

325
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:09,560
experience something special the

326
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:10,610
thumbnail for this video is so much

327
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:12,890
greater than anything I've ever

328
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:14,840
conceived of that honestly it makes me

329
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:15,890
feel like a failure both as a youtuber

330
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:17,660
and as a woman

331
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:20,330
the sperm donation cup is labeled with

332
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:24,070
Gigi's signature the I's are dotted with

333
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:27,020
hearts and her facial expression LLL

334
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:28,760
come the video begins with Gigi

335
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:30,530
explaining that in order to produce a

336
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:32,750
sample for the clinic she had to stop

337
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:34,910
taking hormones for three months so I

338
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:36,710
has it simply agreed I was like fine I

339
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:39,020
will stop all of my hormones so you know

340
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:40,610
my [ __ ] can get juicy again and I could

341
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:42,410
get a good little sample up in here the

342
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:44,900
sperm bank day arrives she goes to the

343
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:48,080
clinic approaches the receptionist and I

344
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:52,700
said yes ma'am I am here to give sperm

345
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:54,200
from me to be frozen now the doctor

346
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:56,360
arrives and leads her to the exam room

347
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:59,150
which she describes with the precision

348
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:01,220
of Mama flu bear I walk into this room

349
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:03,200
fluorescent lighting the house I was

350
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:05,060
like I can see every pore in my arm like

351
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:07,340
Jesus where they want me to do here and

352
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:09,950
then the kicker this like leather couch

353
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:11,870
the back is kind of like angled so I

354
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:13,790
guess like you can lean and really get

355
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:15,920
into it or something the doctor offers

356
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:18,680
her lubrication pornography if needed

357
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:21,230
and a donation cup Gigi closes the door

358
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:23,060
and gets to work I get in the mood I got

359
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:25,040
in this zone and I'm killing it [ __ ]

360
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:27,440
I'm like I'm gonna give the best sample

361
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:29,720
ever my kid is gonna be a god-sent child

362
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:32,210
before I know at the moment has crept up

363
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:35,120
on me it happened and it's been so long

364
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:37,340
that it hits the wall behind me and it's

365
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:40,010
at this moment that glam goddess Gigi

366
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:42,740
gorges gets up off the leather couch and

367
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:44,840
attempts to scrape a prodigious quantity

368
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:47,180
of Gigi jism off the wall of a

369
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:49,880
fluorescent lit exam room in a desperate

370
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:51,260
final bid to become a mother and I took

371
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:53,060
the cup and I was like full-on like

372
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:54,590
scraping it off the wall because I was

373
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:56,150
like I'm not gonna let any little drop

374
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:58,170
go to waste you know I'm here this is

375
00:14:56,150 --> 00:15:00,480
like my moment I try to understand

376
00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:01,950
this video makes me laugh so much it's

377
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,050
really the contrast of style and

378
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:06,300
substance like it wouldn't be funny if a

379
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:08,339
masculine person told this story it's

380
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:10,380
funny because Gigi has this peak

381
00:15:08,339 --> 00:15:12,570
feminine storytelling style in this Real

382
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:16,110
Housewives diction but the story itself

383
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:17,639
is about blasting a giant load onto a

384
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:20,040
wall of a room full of leather and

385
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:22,110
pornography the dissonance between form

386
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:23,910
and content is genius and that

387
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:26,040
dissonance perfectly captures the

388
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:28,290
absurdity of being transgender with a

389
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:30,480
comedic incisiveness that Ricky Gervais

390
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:32,040
is could only dream of I also really

391
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,290
relate to the story because right before

392
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:37,199
I started hormones I decided to freeze a

393
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:39,899
sample of my own so I too have a sperm

394
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:42,360
bank experience and it was exactly like

395
00:15:39,899 --> 00:15:44,490
Gigi describes down to every detail it

396
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:46,230
is not a dignified moment ladies there

397
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:48,389
is just no way to feel like a woman

398
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:50,160
well you're hastily rubbing one out in

399
00:15:48,389 --> 00:15:53,240
an over Latrun designed for men to

400
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:55,829
ejaculate it I feel so fish right now

401
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:56,699
for this five minutes in the exam room I

402
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:58,199
was a man

403
00:15:56,699 --> 00:16:00,120
no I somehow managed to get most of my

404
00:15:58,199 --> 00:16:02,070
sample into the cup but there's a

405
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:03,810
different absurd detail to my story

406
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:06,149
the receptionist of the sperm bank saw

407
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:07,800
on my paperwork that I was depositing

408
00:16:06,149 --> 00:16:09,930
because I was going to start feminizing

409
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,699
hormones and he asked me if there was a

410
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:13,170
name I preferred he called me and

411
00:16:11,699 --> 00:16:15,180
retrospect he was actually really sweet

412
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:16,649
and really cute not that anything was

413
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:19,110
gonna come with that at the time since I

414
00:16:16,649 --> 00:16:21,029
was pray everything and rough around the

415
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:22,500
edges be honest I was all edges but he

416
00:16:21,029 --> 00:16:24,870
asked me for my preferred name and I

417
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:26,790
just blurted out Natalie and so this was

418
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:29,010
actually the first time anyone ever

419
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:30,899
called me by my biological name and it

420
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:31,620
went like this the receptionist at the

421
00:16:30,899 --> 00:16:33,660
sperm bank

422
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:36,300
charged to me and said right this way

423
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:38,130
Natalie here's a cup for you to bust a

424
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:42,000
knot in and that's how my life as a

425
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:44,790
woman began yes now in the end Gigi's

426
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,949
story is actually pretty tragic her

427
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:49,230
sample wasn't usable she wanted to have

428
00:16:46,949 --> 00:16:50,850
a child with her own DNA but she's been

429
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:52,319
on hormones too long and she just can't

430
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:54,360
and that revelation at the end of the

431
00:16:52,319 --> 00:16:56,279
video kind of recontextualizes how you

432
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:58,470
see the whole story in his ridiculous

433
00:16:56,279 --> 00:17:01,170
image of Gigi scraping ejaculate off the

434
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:03,630
wall I now see this primal maternal urge

435
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:05,490
to produce and protects children I see a

436
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:07,370
mother bird whose chicks have fallen

437
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:10,069
prematurely from the nest

438
00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:11,870
I see the Virgin Mary cradling her child

439
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:13,910
I really really thought that I was gonna

440
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:15,620
have a good sample and I was going to be

441
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:17,780
able to participate in having a baby

442
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:19,400
with my DNA but it's just not in the

443
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:21,170
cards for me and I really wanted to make

444
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:23,059
this video more positive and funny

445
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:24,530
because there is nothing I can do and

446
00:17:23,059 --> 00:17:29,660
that's exactly it

447
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:31,910
that is the darkness 5 the darkness the

448
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:34,130
darkness is my name for what I consider

449
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:36,140
the highest form of comedy where you

450
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:38,720
take your own worst feelings traumas and

451
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:41,030
anxieties and twist them into a source

452
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,710
of pleasure the darkness is Richard

453
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:44,570
Pryor running down the street in flames

454
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:47,000
because he set himself on fire in a COAG

455
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:47,690
field psycho says the darkness is GG

456
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,760
gorgeous

457
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:51,559
scraping her own produce jism off the

458
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:53,510
wall of an exam room in a desperate bid

459
00:17:51,559 --> 00:17:55,610
to save her chance at motherhood if you

460
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:57,260
can make these low points funny then

461
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:58,760
you're gonna be okay you're gonna

462
00:17:57,260 --> 00:18:01,220
survive you're gonna make it through

463
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:03,830
life and I need that now more than ever

464
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:06,110
because trans experience is in a lot of

465
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:08,240
ways pretty dark but trans people make

466
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:10,520
it through because we're good humoured

467
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,900
and strong as [ __ ] pretty soon I'm gonna

468
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:13,760
have to stop hormones before an

469
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:15,350
operation and I'm terrified of that

470
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,940
what's gonna happen to me when I stop

471
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:18,800
hormones am I gonna become a man again

472
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:20,690
cuz I don't know if I can handle that

473
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:23,360
I'm thinking about names though like

474
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:25,490
maybe Nathan or Jayden I can't see

475
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:27,080
myself as a Jaden see I've gotta have my

476
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:28,520
little jokey jokes or I don't think I

477
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:30,080
could make it through this like when I

478
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:33,050
have bottom surgery I am absolutely

479
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:35,809
going to constantly refer to it as my

480
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:37,940
sex change operation because it makes me

481
00:18:35,809 --> 00:18:40,130
laugh it brings me joy calling it gender

482
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:42,620
confirmation surgery brings me no joy

483
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:44,570
now it's important to notice that just

484
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:45,740
because it doesn't make me laugh doesn't

485
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:48,350
mean it's a politically correct

486
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:50,840
euphemism gender confirmation is a more

487
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:52,790
accurate term than sex change because

488
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:55,130
you're literally not changing your sex

489
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:57,260
that's not what surgery does but ng

490
00:18:55,130 --> 00:19:00,200
people have their own kind of political

491
00:18:57,260 --> 00:19:02,600
correctness with a mistake edginess for

492
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:04,490
honesty accuracy and directness but

493
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:06,650
these are very different things for

494
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:08,720
example George Carlin has a classic bit

495
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:11,059
about euphemisms that has some great

496
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,929
moments but also some moments that are

497
00:19:11,059 --> 00:19:14,600
way off base

498
00:19:11,929 --> 00:19:16,520
for example content wording ablest slur

499
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:17,700
they say they're going to pre-board

500
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:22,460
those pass

501
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:26,010
in need of special assistance cripples

502
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:28,080
simple honest direct language so look I

503
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:30,210
understand the aesthetic preference for

504
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:32,250
simple honest direct language and the

505
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:34,200
repulsion toward verbose bureaucratic

506
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:36,180
jargon that's why so much of the rest of

507
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:38,370
this bit is so good but the word he just

508
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:40,320
used is literally a slur so I wonder if

509
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:42,210
what you're being honest about is your

510
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:44,100
feelings toward disabled people because

511
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:46,590
the phrase passengers in need of special

512
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:48,180
assistance is a little wordy sure but in

513
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:49,920
this situation it's actually more

514
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:51,720
accurate since it also includes the

515
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:53,850
elderly the pregnant anyone in need of

516
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:55,680
assistance boarding so I call my gender

517
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:57,750
confirmation surgery getting a sex

518
00:19:55,680 --> 00:20:00,000
change not because it's more direct and

519
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:02,400
honest but specifically because it's

520
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,090
inaccurate and outdated and that makes

521
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,740
me laugh

522
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:07,770
not because I'm a fearless truth teller

523
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:09,960
but because I'm a bad person and I get

524
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:11,670
to call it my sex change operation but

525
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:14,180
sis people don't get to call it that

526
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:16,770
because it's my darkness not yours

527
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:18,570
get your own darkness when ricky gervais

528
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:20,370
jokes about trans people he's being a

529
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:22,380
hack cuz he knows nothing of our

530
00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:23,580
darkness and when someone tries to joke

531
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:25,890
about something that they're totally

532
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:28,200
ignorant of the result is usually clumsy

533
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:30,000
awkward and not very funny what I'd

534
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:31,920
really like to see is if ricky gervais

535
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,500
stook all that irreverent bad-boy

536
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:37,260
derisive nests and turned it within

537
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:40,850
because within is where the darkness

538
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:43,020
lies sinks self deprecation

539
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:45,630
self-deprecating humor is my personal

540
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:47,820
favorite because as a lazy selfish

541
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:49,680
craning attention [ __ ] who looks like a

542
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:51,930
slightly more passable Ann Coulter with

543
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:53,580
a voice of a tropical bird there's a lot

544
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:55,050
of material here to work with but

545
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:57,540
especially when it comes to the trans

546
00:20:55,050 --> 00:21:00,120
jokes there is a faction of the trans

547
00:20:57,540 --> 00:21:02,190
community that is not amused by the

548
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:04,080
buffoonery that goes on on this channel

549
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:06,480
I think the objection to it is best

550
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:08,550
summed up by the comic Hannah Gatsby who

551
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:10,770
and her stand-up special Nanette said

552
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:13,230
that when self deprecation comes from

553
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:18,090
someone who exists in the margins it's

554
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:19,860
not humility it's humiliation and to be

555
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:23,520
honest I felt a little called out by

556
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:26,760
that I put myself down in order to speak

557
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:28,419
in order to seek permission to speak and

558
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:30,309
she's not wrong like that is

559
00:21:28,419 --> 00:21:32,379
how this works in order to gain an

560
00:21:30,309 --> 00:21:34,720
audience as a trans person you have to

561
00:21:32,379 --> 00:21:37,509
demonstrate with sis people call self

562
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:39,460
awareness that is you have to signal

563
00:21:37,509 --> 00:21:41,859
that you see yourself the way the

564
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:44,169
audience sees you which can mean looking

565
00:21:41,859 --> 00:21:45,820
at yourself with a pretty merciless gaze

566
00:21:44,169 --> 00:21:47,919
and of course I'm happy to do that

567
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:49,480
because I have no self respect and

568
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:51,759
laughter is the only way to numb the

569
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:53,919
pain but the terrible thing about being

570
00:21:51,759 --> 00:21:55,289
a not normal with an audience is that

571
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:57,309
you don't just get to be yourself

572
00:21:55,289 --> 00:21:59,470
because whether you like it or not

573
00:21:57,309 --> 00:22:03,879
people will see you as a representative

574
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:06,249
of the community oh so because of that

575
00:22:03,879 --> 00:22:08,379
responsibility which I never asked for I

576
00:22:06,249 --> 00:22:10,690
have to balance out the self deprecation

577
00:22:08,379 --> 00:22:13,509
with a lot of positive messaging about

578
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:16,450
my people and that way the dark shocks

579
00:22:13,509 --> 00:22:19,090
function as a spoonful of sugar to help

580
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:20,859
the feminine penis go down but even

581
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:23,710
without the group representation issue

582
00:22:20,859 --> 00:22:26,590
it definitely is possible to take self

583
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:27,999
deprecation too far as I said I have

584
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:30,700
been diagnosed with an incurable

585
00:22:27,999 --> 00:22:33,009
edginess of temperament and I sometimes

586
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:35,379
do feel suffocated by the safe space

587
00:22:33,009 --> 00:22:36,700
rules of a lot of trans spaces even

588
00:22:35,379 --> 00:22:38,470
though those spaces are there for good

589
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:40,809
reason and a lot of people need them but

590
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:42,789
sometimes this atmosphere of everything

591
00:22:40,809 --> 00:22:45,460
and everyone is solid all the time

592
00:22:42,789 --> 00:22:47,590
no uncomfortable questions may be asked

593
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:50,139
any self deprecation is a sign of

594
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:51,639
traumatic internalized bigotry I just

595
00:22:50,139 --> 00:22:54,249
need to get out of there for a while and

596
00:22:51,639 --> 00:22:57,009
find a place where I can relax and be my

597
00:22:54,249 --> 00:22:58,989
edgy self I need a safe space for my

598
00:22:57,009 --> 00:23:01,059
edginess where I can just blurt out

599
00:22:58,989 --> 00:23:03,009
whatever stupid question or joke comes

600
00:23:01,059 --> 00:23:04,509
to mind without being afraid that I'm

601
00:23:03,009 --> 00:23:06,970
gonna inflict horrible trauma

602
00:23:04,509 --> 00:23:09,039
I never went around me so I call up

603
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:11,049
another transsexual edge lady you know

604
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:13,659
Kiki accuse each other of being cross

605
00:23:11,049 --> 00:23:16,840
dressers and just laugh it all off and

606
00:23:13,659 --> 00:23:18,119
it's so so cathartic to do that but it

607
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:20,529
does have to be done in moderation

608
00:23:18,119 --> 00:23:22,119
because there can come a point where

609
00:23:20,529 --> 00:23:24,249
you're picking at the wound and

610
00:23:22,119 --> 00:23:26,769
of numbing it and it mostly has to be

611
00:23:24,249 --> 00:23:28,929
done in private because in public you

612
00:23:26,769 --> 00:23:30,969
have to worry about how this people will

613
00:23:28,929 --> 00:23:33,039
interpret it and so you have to find a

614
00:23:30,969 --> 00:23:35,589
way to be self-deprecating without

615
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:36,999
abandoning all social responsibility yes

616
00:23:35,589 --> 00:23:39,759
if there was ever a phrase that

617
00:23:36,999 --> 00:23:42,039
instantly deadens all after its social

618
00:23:39,759 --> 00:23:43,989
responsibility but since its kind of the

619
00:23:42,039 --> 00:23:46,239
central topic of the comedy culture war

620
00:23:43,989 --> 00:23:48,429
I should probably say something about it

621
00:23:46,239 --> 00:23:50,979
even though believe me I'd much rather

622
00:23:48,429 --> 00:23:54,789
go back to jabbering about my sex change

623
00:23:50,979 --> 00:23:56,649
7 the eternal tension so what is a

624
00:23:54,789 --> 00:23:57,729
comedians job what is a comedian

625
00:23:56,649 --> 00:24:00,129
supposed to do

626
00:23:57,729 --> 00:24:02,379
I suppose my ideal comedian is one who

627
00:24:00,129 --> 00:24:05,019
is perfectly able to balance the tension

628
00:24:02,379 --> 00:24:07,719
between shitposting and snowflake eree

629
00:24:05,019 --> 00:24:10,509
and this is an eternal tension it must

630
00:24:07,719 --> 00:24:12,969
never be resolved it is a tightrope I

631
00:24:10,509 --> 00:24:14,619
have devoted my life to walking see if

632
00:24:12,969 --> 00:24:17,199
the tension collapses into pure

633
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:19,209
snowflake eree you've got a moralist who

634
00:24:17,199 --> 00:24:21,399
might say that a comedians purpose is to

635
00:24:19,209 --> 00:24:23,829
promote justice by punching up by

636
00:24:21,399 --> 00:24:26,229
speaking truth to power by exposing the

637
00:24:23,829 --> 00:24:28,329
flaws of bigoted mindsets and so on and

638
00:24:26,229 --> 00:24:29,979
these are all very admirable goals but

639
00:24:28,329 --> 00:24:32,649
they leave out what I think is the

640
00:24:29,979 --> 00:24:35,319
essential purpose of comedy which is to

641
00:24:32,649 --> 00:24:37,269
be funny to surprise to shock to make

642
00:24:35,319 --> 00:24:39,549
people laugh it's kind of like how some

643
00:24:37,269 --> 00:24:41,049
art and media critics only ever evaluate

644
00:24:39,549 --> 00:24:43,239
a work based on whether or not it's

645
00:24:41,049 --> 00:24:44,979
socially progressive and don't seem to

646
00:24:43,239 --> 00:24:47,739
really think about aesthetic pleasure

647
00:24:44,979 --> 00:24:49,659
very much which to me is the reason why

648
00:24:47,739 --> 00:24:52,629
art exists in the first place but then

649
00:24:49,659 --> 00:24:54,219
again I am a hedonistic bushwa decadent

650
00:24:52,629 --> 00:24:55,809
and should probably be sent to the

651
00:24:54,219 --> 00:24:57,279
guillotine at once just let me do my

652
00:24:55,809 --> 00:24:58,839
makeup first so that when they hold my

653
00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:00,519
head up everyone can see my beat and

654
00:24:58,839 --> 00:25:01,929
their wings all fly to the Bastille also

655
00:25:00,519 --> 00:25:04,619
someone please post the video to my

656
00:25:01,929 --> 00:25:07,089
Instagram cuz that's gonna get a lot of

657
00:25:04,619 --> 00:25:09,339
engagement so the opposite of the Pierre

658
00:25:07,089 --> 00:25:11,169
snowflake is the pure shet poster who

659
00:25:09,339 --> 00:25:12,699
might say that a comedians purpose is to

660
00:25:11,169 --> 00:25:14,649
make an audience laugh by any means

661
00:25:12,699 --> 00:25:17,019
necessary but that seems kind of

662
00:25:14,649 --> 00:25:19,059
barbaric since like if a guard in a

663
00:25:17,019 --> 00:25:21,039
prison camp is torturing an inmate and

664
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:23,259
the other guards are laughing does that

665
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:25,809
count as comedy is a war crime funny

666
00:25:23,259 --> 00:25:28,749
well according to the Geneva Convention

667
00:25:25,809 --> 00:25:30,909
it's hilarious the thing is I don't

668
00:25:28,749 --> 00:25:31,680
think many comedians actually believe in

669
00:25:30,909 --> 00:25:33,750
a completely

670
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:35,490
holistic vision of comedy I think they

671
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:37,590
sometimes pretend to when they're trying

672
00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:40,050
to evade criticism I mean take even the

673
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:41,580
edgiest of white guy comics and listen

674
00:25:40,050 --> 00:25:43,800
to the way they talk about their heroes

675
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:45,360
Lenny Bruce or George Carlin there's

676
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:48,630
always an element of admiration for

677
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:50,190
bravery risk subversion truth-telling

678
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:52,020
in other words there's a concern there

679
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:54,780
for what is virtuous and what is true

680
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:56,280
not just for what makes people laugh so

681
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:58,500
maybe before we can even talk about

682
00:25:56,280 --> 00:26:00,150
what's funny we have to have a level of

683
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:02,310
shared agreement about what is true and

684
00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:04,920
what is morally right my objection to

685
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:06,630
Ricky Gervais is trans jokes is not just

686
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:08,970
that they're not funny I think he's

687
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:11,250
wrong about trans people and I think his

688
00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:13,350
ignorance is infectious I think he's

689
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:15,540
stirring up bigoted sentiments in his

690
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:17,310
audience which has the consequence of

691
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:19,650
making the world slightly scarier for

692
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:22,050
people like me and too this is edginess

693
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:24,150
at its worst just a privileged person

694
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:25,530
with a platform punching down at a

695
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:27,120
politically besieged group he

696
00:26:25,530 --> 00:26:28,860
understands nothing about and that's

697
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:30,810
what happens when the snowflake shits

698
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:33,960
post-tension collapses into peer

699
00:26:30,810 --> 00:26:35,880
shitposting it's boring and immature

700
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:37,710
like when someone says he wants to watch

701
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:40,140
the world burn you only get to watch

702
00:26:37,710 --> 00:26:42,990
when you have the privilege of not being

703
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:45,750
on fire it's edgy but it's not the

704
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:49,020
darkness the darkness is finding a way

705
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:51,450
to laugh about being on fire edginess is

706
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:55,170
always adolescent the darkness is

707
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:57,510
edginess aged by time and pain and it's

708
00:26:55,170 --> 00:26:59,670
only at that full maturity that comedy

709
00:26:57,510 --> 00:27:04,620
becomes art that it becomes comparable

710
00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:11,640
to music so those are my thoughts like

711
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:14,030
comment and subscribe the end final sing

712
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:14,030
the song

713
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:29,870
I wish my brother George was here hello

714
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:35,690
darkness my old friend I've come to talk

715
00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:41,030
with you again because a vision softly

716
00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:45,840
creeping left its seeds while I was

717
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:53,279
sleeping and the vision

[Music]

00:27:53,279 --> 00:28:06,940
we feel the sound of silence in Restless

720
00:28:00,850 --> 00:28:12,669
dreams I walked alone narrow streets of

721
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:19,739
cobblestone Neath the halo of a street

722
00:28:12,669 --> 00:28:19,739

10,000 people maybe more

726
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:59,720
people talking without speaking people

727
