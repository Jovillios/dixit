beginning and you've seen my story my

17
00:00:58,039 --> 00:01:01,519
whole entire journey this journey I've

18
00:00:59,689 --> 00:01:02,989
been on as a transgender woman you've

19
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:04,519
been with me on this whole journey this

20
00:01:02,989 --> 00:01:05,869
is my truth and you've accepted the

21
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:07,310
truth of my journey as a really

22
00:01:05,869 --> 00:01:08,840
vulnerable moment for me and you guys

23
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:09,830

here for me throughout my whole

25
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:13,220
transgender your message of my journey

26
00:01:11,569 --> 00:01:15,380
as a vulnerable servant of it's just

27
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:18,789
been so an explosion lighter and the

28
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:18,789
terms are guarantees America

29
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:31,050
[Music]

30
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:32,850
I think the main thing we've learned

31
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:34,650
together on this channel as that makeup

32
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:36,870
is a lot of fun but it's inner beauty

33
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:38,760
that really counts anyway let's talk

34
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:41,010
about plastic surgery I had a facial

35
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:42,630
feminization surgery on April 2nd so

36
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:44,430
about a month and a half ago what we

37
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:46,710
call a facial feminization surgery or

38
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:48,510
ffs is actually a series of different

39
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:50,700
procedures that some transgender women

40
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:53,070
choose to have to look more feminine so

41
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:55,410
what I had done is forehead contouring a

42
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:57,660
brow lift a rhinoplasty mandible

43
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:59,400
contouring a trachea shave you know what

44
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:59,880
let's just how the skull ad talk you

45
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:03,210
through it

46
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:05,970
a coronal incision was made a swatch the

47
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:08,820
cranial vote whence the skin of the

48
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:12,300
forehead was stripped away from the bone

49
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:15,720
a fragment of the supraorbital Ridge was

50
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:19,400
then chiseled away removed reshaped and

51
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:22,110
Rhea fixed thereby eliminating that

52
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:25,470
undesirable prominence of a robust brow

53
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:28,830
but oftimes distinguishes this skull of

54
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:31,520
the Chad a second decision was made with

55
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:34,110
warts the columellar of the nasal septum

56
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:37,410
facilitating the reconstruction of the

57
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:40,650
Interior cartilage and bone further

58
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:43,080
incisions were made between the gum and

59
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:46,380
cheek through which the mandible was

60
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:50,220
rasped and shaved down to a grace I'll

61
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:52,320
curvature a jaw and pointed chin thereby

62
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:55,080
delineating a facial silhouette

63
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:57,420
exhibiting that aspect which medical men

64
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:58,980
called Conte it all sounds pretty

65
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:00,750
gruesome when you describe it like that

66
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:03,120
but there's actually a very fine level

67
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:05,280
of technique and aesthetics involved my

68
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,810
plastic surgeon is an artist

69
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,430
the results are natural I don't look

70
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:09,840
like I've had a bunch of work done which

71
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:11,519
is good you know you at least want to

72
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,440
leave people wondering maybe she's born

73
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,269
with it maybe a surgeon killed her face

74
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,560
off and fixed her shitty skull here's it

75
00:03:15,269 --> 00:03:18,090
before and after picture where you can

76
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,980
clearly see the difference T is the

77
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:20,400
exact medical terminology my brows on

78
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:22,380
fleek

79
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,209
my nose is no longer busted the house my

80
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:26,040
jaw snatched and my Adam's apple is

81
00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:28,230
cancelled wasn't it always really Eve's

82
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:29,850
Apple may be Satan's Apple I think I

83
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:32,160
still look like myself it's not a new

84
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:34,050
face we're talking about millimeters of

85
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:36,510
bone here but to have all that done was

86
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:39,030
well it costs a lot of money the

87
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:41,250
anticipation was a terror like I've

88
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:43,530
never known the pain was

89
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:45,180
rabble and the recovery took more than a

90
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:47,190
month in fact I still have some swelling

91
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:49,230
in my jowls cowls there's a nice

92
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:50,850
feminine sounding word love that the

93
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:52,290
standard YouTube tea girl thing to do of

94
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:52,860
course would have been to vlog the whole

95
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:54,930
journey

96
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:57,660
storytime my facial surgery experience

97
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:59,730
my ffs journey and post constant social

98
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:01,170
media updates about it and I am grateful

99
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:03,060
to the trans woman who have done that

100
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:05,130
because it was really helpful to me to

101
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:06,810
be able to watch those vlogs in advance

102
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:08,820
and know what I was getting myself into

103
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:10,680
but I decided not to post about the

104
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:12,720
surgery because I wanted privacy for the

105
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:14,459
recovery and to just take some time to

106
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,350
get to feel at home with the results

107
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:17,760
before subjecting myself to the vicious

108
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:19,590
things they say about me and the

109
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:21,450
tabloids you know I think I've been kind

110
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:23,250
of psychologically damaged by reading

111
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:25,020
for years the things people say about my

112
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:26,820
appearance online and I'm not even

113
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:28,740
talking about the haters like at this

114
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:30,180
point I can mostly brush them off but

115
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:31,770
for instance about a year ago I was

116
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:33,840
reading through a transgender subreddit

117
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:35,520
and some trans woman was ionizing about

118
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,290
her appearance and someone offered the

119
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,810
encouragement you know you can still

120
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:43,290
look hot even if you don't pass just

121
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:45,419
look at contra points oh like a dagger

122
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:47,169
to the horror the unintentional shade of

123
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:49,509
it all

124
00:04:47,169 --> 00:04:52,030
so the past six weeks have been at times

125
00:04:49,509 --> 00:04:54,219
difficult and lonely but I did manage to

126
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:55,900
keep my mug off social media for long

127
00:04:54,219 --> 00:04:57,759
enough that I'm as ready as I'm ever

128
00:04:55,900 --> 00:05:00,490
going to be for the commentary of the

129
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:03,099
Internet so bring it on you jackals you

130
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:05,229
vultures you Goblin swine well I was

131
00:05:03,099 --> 00:05:06,729
lying around bandaged and bored I did

132
00:05:05,229 --> 00:05:08,860
have a lot of time to think and what

133
00:05:06,729 --> 00:05:10,270
I've been thinking about is probably the

134
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:13,449
same thing you're wondering right now

135
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:14,409
which is why would someone do what I

136
00:05:13,449 --> 00:05:16,210
just did

137
00:05:14,409 --> 00:05:18,490
why would I spend so much time and money

138
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:21,219
and go through so much anxiety and pain

139
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:23,439
just to change a few millimeters of bone

140
00:05:21,219 --> 00:05:26,020
isn't this all just extravagant vanity

141
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:27,550
some narcissistic symptom of phones but

142
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:29,050
too much well I feel like there's a lot

143
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:31,060
of pressure on me to say that in fact

144
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:32,919
this wasn't cosmetic surgery at all

145
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:34,960
usually trans people say that surgery is

146
00:05:32,919 --> 00:05:37,210
like facial feminization top surgery

147
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:39,189
general reassignment and so on served

148
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:41,800
the sole purpose of alleviating gender

149
00:05:39,189 --> 00:05:43,689
dysphoria this discomfort we feel with

150
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,460
the mismatch between our bodies and our

151
00:05:43,689 --> 00:05:47,259
gender identity so what I'm supposed to

152
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:49,210
say is that my surgery was a medically

153
00:05:47,259 --> 00:05:51,849
necessary reconstructive procedure

154
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:53,889
needed to make my testosterone whether

155
00:05:51,849 --> 00:05:55,900
facial bones match the five-foot-two

156
00:05:53,889 --> 00:05:58,360
happy baby bouncy bio girl I truly am

157
00:05:55,900 --> 00:06:00,849
inside thereby alleviating my dysphoria

158
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:02,680
helping me safely blend into society and

159
00:06:00,849 --> 00:06:04,689
preventing a five-alarm psychiatric

160
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:06,399
meltdown and there is definitely truth

161
00:06:04,689 --> 00:06:07,870
to that it's certainly the argument I

162
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:10,029
intend to make when I write this off as

163
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:12,069
a medical expense on my taxes if you're

164
00:06:10,029 --> 00:06:14,319
an IRS auditor please stop this video

165
00:06:12,069 --> 00:06:16,180
now and insert the next floppy disk into

166
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:18,939
your CD Drive but hypothetically

167
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:21,039
speaking I think the reality might not

168
00:06:18,939 --> 00:06:22,930
be quite as simple how sharp is the line

169
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:24,759
separating gender dysphoria from the

170
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:26,620
other kinds of body image dysphoria that

171
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:28,990
drives cisgender people to get cosmetic

172
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:30,460
surgery all the time last year when I

173
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:32,500
used to foolishly tweet things of

174
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:34,960
substance I tweeted that I wanted to get

175
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:36,550
ffs and some trans people responded

176
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,050
telling me that I was suffering from

177
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:39,909
internalized transphobia and

178
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:41,620
self-loathing they compared it to East

179
00:06:39,909 --> 00:06:43,360
Asian people getting double eyelid

180
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:45,310
surgery or so-called ethnic rhinoplasty

181
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,319
which they say are motivated by

182
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:49,120
internalized racism and Western beauty

183
00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:51,250
standards I think that's a pretty weak

184
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,779
analogy and telling a trans person to

185
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:55,000
just learn to accept the way they look

186
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:56,649
can actually be kind of transphobic

187
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,930
because a big part of what it even means

188
00:06:56,649 --> 00:07:00,820
to be trans at least for me

189
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:03,190
the desire to look more female but I

190
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:05,229
also think trans people often talk like

191
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:08,139
gender dysphoria is this intrinsic

192
00:07:05,229 --> 00:07:10,240
personal experience that's always 100%

193
00:07:08,139 --> 00:07:11,919
valid and never has anything at all to

194
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,169
do with the external pressure of beauty

195
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:16,539
standards but in fact gender dysphoria

196
00:07:14,169 --> 00:07:18,310
is not sealed away in a vacuum away from

197
00:07:16,539 --> 00:07:20,440
the influence of societal ideals and

198
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:22,840
norms early in my transition some of my

199
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:24,970
worst dysphoria was about body hair so I

200
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:27,160
had full body laser hair removal and now

201
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:28,900
I'm smoother than a cisgender boiled egg

202
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:30,850
but where does the idea that women don't

203
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:33,039
have body hair come from isn't that just

204
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:34,690
an arbitrary grooming custom a lot of

205
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:36,970
this is women I know don't so much as a

206
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:39,039
shave their legs so maybe I'm not even

207
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:41,410
trying to look like a sis woman maybe

208
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:44,199
I'm simply doing everything I can to

209
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:47,680
avoid looking like the caricature of a

210
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:50,229
knuckly hairy bird mannish trans woman

211
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:53,289
with which society has terrorized me to

212
00:07:50,229 --> 00:07:55,780
my core is this gender dysphoria or is

213
00:07:53,289 --> 00:07:58,120
it internalized transphobia or is it

214
00:07:55,780 --> 00:08:00,400
simply a cosmetic preference when I try

215
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:02,320
to psychoanalyze myself I find that my

216
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:04,659
desire is to look female to look

217
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:06,460
feminine and to look beautiful are not

218
00:08:04,659 --> 00:08:08,979
exactly the same but they're woven

219
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:10,810
together so tightly that it's kind of

220
00:08:08,979 --> 00:08:12,250
difficult to untangle them and the

221
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:14,830
opposite is also true

222
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:17,590
that for me feeling mannish or dysphoric

223
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:19,210
usually goes along with feeling ugly I

224
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:20,979
don't have a lot of days where I walk

225
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:22,690
out the house thinking well I'm giving

226
00:08:20,979 --> 00:08:24,550
femme queen realness but apart from that

227
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:25,990
I look like absolute [ __ ] of course

228
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:27,370
there are qualities that make you look

229
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:30,190
female that aren't necessarily

230
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:32,440
attractive like cellulite or flabby arms

231
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:34,630
which are super fish but aren't deemed

232
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:37,300
beautiful by society the truth is I

233
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:40,060
don't just want to look female I want to

234
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:41,050
be beautiful desperately God will do

235
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:43,419
anything

236
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:45,370
and evening in this video I want to

237
00:08:43,419 --> 00:08:47,410
explore why I'm so obsessed with being

238
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:49,330
beautiful and why it seems like a lot of

239
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:50,050
people who live in a society we're so

240
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:53,920
obsessed

241
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:55,300
is it phones I know you're supposed to

242
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,890
pretend that you don't care about being

243
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:58,720
beautiful or that you're not trying but

244
00:08:56,890 --> 00:09:00,160
guys it's the only thing I care about

245
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,839
and I've never tried so hard anything of

246
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:03,490
course I do feel guilty about being so

247
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:05,440
obsessed with it because there is this

248
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:08,230
idea that caring about beauty makes you

249
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:10,089
shallow or vain you know smart people

250
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:11,920
aren't supposed to care about beauty and

251
00:09:10,089 --> 00:09:14,050
I've always been categorized as a smart

252
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,670
person by people around me some of that

253
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:17,560
is when you're raised like I was as a

254
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:19,660
middle-class white boy with no athletic

255
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:21,160
talent parents and teachers treat you

256
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:23,470
like a [ __ ] genius

257
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:25,660
like Einstein nutted a load in Mozart's

258
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:27,160
Buzzi and Mozart shot you out while he

259
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:29,350
was getting a rusty trombone from

260
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:31,209
Vincent van Gogh it inspired his famous

261
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:33,220
painting starfish Knight but even among

262
00:09:31,209 --> 00:09:34,870
women caring about beauty is often

263
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:36,790
frowned upon I feel like an alien

264
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:39,010
species when I hang out with women in

265
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:40,899
academia and I know a few because I once

266
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:43,120
got half a PhD before dropping out to

267
00:09:40,899 --> 00:09:45,820
become a what do you call someone who

268
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:47,350
makes videos a cam girl most female grad

269
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:49,000
students and professors I know don't

270
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:50,890
wear makeup to them the idea of

271
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,170
earnestly putting on press-on nails or

272
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:55,390
false eyelashes is inconceivable like

273
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:57,100
maybe on Halloween now part of that is

274
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:58,630
that women in male-dominated fields

275
00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:00,430
sometimes feel like they have to present

276
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:01,839
more masculine to be taken seriously

277
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:04,300
because of this prejudice that

278
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:06,279
beautified femininity equals frivolous

279
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:08,290
but another part is clearly some kind of

280
00:10:06,279 --> 00:10:11,110
not like other girls weird flux which

281
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:12,490
okay fine whatever I'm not going to

282
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:14,320
judge another woman for the way she

283
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:15,490
cooks with a society that pressures

284
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,440
women to be beautiful while

285
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:19,149
simultaneously belittling them for

286
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,370
caring about it I guess my way of coping

287
00:10:19,149 --> 00:10:23,709
is this tacky heteronormative and

288
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:26,199
tragically sincere aspiration to some

289
00:10:23,709 --> 00:10:27,250
kind of post ironic feminine beauty why

290
00:10:26,199 --> 00:10:28,440
am I like this

291
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:30,760
well part of it is vindictive

292
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:32,050
transsexualism pure and simple to all

293
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:34,660
the people who have ever called me a man

294
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:36,880
I want to say [ __ ] you by looking like

295
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:38,860
the undeniable visual archetype of a

296
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:42,670
woman which is a beautiful feminine

297
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:46,800
woman who's wearing six hundred thousand

298
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:46,800
sequins their biological sequence

299
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:52,300
oh that is some an Samaras right there

300
00:10:50,560 --> 00:11:01,940
inside

301
00:10:52,300 --> 00:11:04,710
[Music]

302
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:07,260
another factor is this shitty website

303
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:09,630
I'm a professional YouTube influencer

304
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:11,850
forgive me father and I'm on camera all

305
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:14,430
the time I edit my own videos so I spend

306
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:16,470
upwards of 60 hours a month staring at

307
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:17,700
my own face on a screen now you try

308
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:20,160
doing that and see what kind of [ __ ]

309
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:22,470
up complex you develop plus I compare

310
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:24,300
myself to other women who make videos a

311
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:26,190
lot of the trans women on YouTube are so

312
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:28,410
young and so beautiful it makes me want

313
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:30,120
to throw up and in comparison for a long

314
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:33,240
time I felt like this

315
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:36,030
shabby aging transvestite just this

316
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:37,920
feral cat wandering the aisles of the

317
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:39,930
liquor store so I'm insecure I'm

318
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:41,910
compensating for that whole mess but I

319
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:44,130
honestly don't present the beautiful

320
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:45,990
people I really just stand the hell out

321
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:47,760
of them I follow this woman on YouTube

322
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:50,460
and I want to be just like her mom her

323
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:52,770
name is named Jefferson Starr her name

324
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:55,500
is Lady Jayne MacLean senior on Nicole

325
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:57,390
Bethany Jade tutorials tatyana petrov

326
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:59,310
NatWest Ricola and of course my queen

327
00:11:57,390 --> 00:12:00,750
and perfect goddess human sty Stan and

328
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:02,070
whose portrait I've painted hundreds of

329
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:03,870
times so there's maybe some extra

330
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:05,400
intensity for me but I think it's

331
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:07,260
actually pretty normal to want to be

332
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:08,430
beautiful I think you even grad students

333
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:10,290
want to be beautiful they just want to

334
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:12,510
do it in that Becky kind of way will you

335
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:13,800
scoff at anything glam or artificial and

336
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:16,110
it's not just women who care about

337
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:17,700
beauty either I mean gay men in LA I've

338
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:19,560
always been getting cosmetic surgery but

339
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:21,570
now even the straights are doing it in

340
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:23,250

341
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:25,020
defects of their personal appearance and

342
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:27,060
the ones who are completely black pilled

343
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:29,160

00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:31,050
cell news speak word for beauty is looks

literally facial masculinization surgery

370
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:25,129
so everyone's obsessed with the bones

371
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:28,730
everyone's obsessed with beauty whether

372
00:13:25,129 --> 00:13:30,889
man or woman cysts or trans gay or gamer

373
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:32,629
maybe lesbians are just straight chillin

374
00:13:30,889 --> 00:13:35,089
well everyone else has completely lost

375
00:13:32,629 --> 00:13:35,839
their minds but why why do we care so

376
00:13:35,089 --> 00:13:37,670
much

377
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:39,800
but within cells by their own account

378
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:41,930
the only reason they care is they think

379
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:43,790
that looks maxing will make females have

380
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:46,000
sex with them and I think of that will

381
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:49,730
make their lives feel meaningful which

382
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,379
it will not so in cells are cancelled

383
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:52,370
now what about women what's our deal

384
00:13:51,379 --> 00:13:54,230
what's our sitch

385
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:55,370
what's our vibe what's our veg well man

386
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:57,290
seem to think that women are like

387
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:59,930
inverted in cells that we care about

388
00:13:57,290 --> 00:14:01,519
beauty and wear makeup fake up because

389
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:03,410
we're trying to attract men

390
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:05,240
my daddy Don Juan on Vice news last year

391
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:06,889
and said that women wear makeup because

392
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:09,529
they're trying to stimulate male sexual

393
00:14:06,889 --> 00:14:11,420
arousal and because evolution now there

394
00:14:09,529 --> 00:14:14,839
is a go being bratty I gotta say this is

395
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:17,029
maybe 10% true and 90% false for one

396
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:18,470
thing straight men don't like makeup at

397
00:14:17,029 --> 00:14:20,209
least they don't think they do here's a

398
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:21,470
chart I made illustrating what every

399
00:14:20,209 --> 00:14:24,170
straight man in the world thinks about

400
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:25,850
makeup yes I asked all of them if you

401
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:27,740
wear no makeup they think you look

402
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:29,149
diseased and I actually do look diseased

403
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:30,980
when I don't wear makeup so fair enough

404
00:14:29,149 --> 00:14:33,170
if you were a natural makeup you know a

405
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:35,000
little concealer or mascara maybe a nude

406
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:36,589
lip they think you're not wearing any

407
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,629
makeup and they like it if you wear a

408
00:14:36,589 --> 00:14:40,699
county makeup colorful eye shadow heavy

409
00:14:38,629 --> 00:14:42,620
contouring overdrawn lips they think

410
00:14:40,699 --> 00:14:44,809
it's dumb and they hate it of course I'm

411
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:46,730
generalizing hashtag not all daddy

412
00:14:44,809 --> 00:14:48,800
Thomas but if women really wore may go

413
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:50,449
to attract man then you'd expect that

414
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:53,029
they'd stop wearing it when there are no

415
00:14:50,449 --> 00:14:54,649
men around but that doesn't happen about

416
00:14:53,029 --> 00:14:56,269
a month ago there was that video going

417
00:14:54,649 --> 00:14:58,309
around of a woman showing how to make a

418
00:14:56,269 --> 00:15:00,410
jailhouse makeup mixing deodorant and

419
00:14:58,309 --> 00:15:02,449
magazine inked make eyeshadow using

420
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:04,160
kool-aid and Vaseline to make a lipstick

421
00:15:02,449 --> 00:15:05,839
there's not a lot of man in women's

422
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:07,610
prison but women are still performing

423
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:09,920
incredible feats of ingenuity and

424
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:12,649
resourcefulness just to wear makeup so

425
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:14,689
maybe women are using makeup to express

426
00:15:12,649 --> 00:15:16,910
their individuality and femininity you

427
00:15:14,689 --> 00:15:18,350
know things that Prison tries to take

428
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:20,870
away from you kind of makes sense

429
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:23,120
there's a refinery29 documentary about

430
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:24,750
prison cosmetology and also sexual

431
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,550
exploitation yikes in which of

432
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:28,590
inmate describes how women would engage

433
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:30,540
in sexual bartering with male guards

434
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:32,970
just to get makeup if a girl's

435
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:35,250
performing sexual favors from an officer

436
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:37,890
he would bring her in colored pencils

437
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:39,630
lipgloss things like that that's right

438
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:42,120
women are a sucking dick so they can put

439
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:43,740
on makeup not the other way around

440
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:46,770
honestly if all the men died tomorrow

441
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:48,420
off I definitely keep wearing makeup in

442
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:49,470
fact I might wear more and I'm not just

443
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:51,510
saying that cuz I'm trying to win

444
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:53,850
feminist points or anything like do I

445
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:56,820
want to attract man yes of course I do

446
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:58,620
do I want to a chart to women I guess I

447
00:15:56,820 --> 00:16:01,200
don't really think about it isn't it

448
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:03,750
safer to just secretly fall in love with

449
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:05,010
them while quietly dying inside whatever

450
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:06,690
it's fine

451
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:08,610
I want to attract a non-binary people to

452
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:10,230
of course but right now you guys are

453
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:12,480
kind of getting in the way of my crudely

454
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:14,940
stereotyping people based on gender so

455
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:16,650
how dare you the point is when I think

456
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:18,420
about my appearance wanting to attract

457
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:20,160
people to have sex with is not the main

458
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:22,880
thing going through my head what is

459
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,880
going through my head

460
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:30,870
I guess I just want to feel beautiful I

461
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:32,880
want to see myself in the mirror and

462
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:34,950
think I look snotch is that a crime I

463
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,930
don't feel pretty very often I'd say it

464
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:39,180
happens about once a month I'm having a

465
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:41,580
good skin day I do my makeup just right

466
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:44,970
like a listen with setting spray and

467
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:50,130
that happens a tingle goes up my spine

468
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:55,500
I am Botticelli I am van Gogh I have

469
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:57,240
created Beauty I'm a girl and then it's

470
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:58,380
over that's it for a month you really

471
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,880
want to look in the mirror I can't

472
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:01,500
actually tell whether I'm pretty or not

473
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:03,060
like with other people I can just look

474
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:05,640
at them and instantly make a judgement

475
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:07,410
about it but with myself I have to just

476
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:08,850
guess it's the same as being a trans

477
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:14,189
person trying to figure out whether you

478
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:17,730
pass would you clock me I'd clock me I'd

479
00:17:14,189 --> 00:17:19,170
[ __ ] me - I don't give a [ __ ] get out of

480
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:19,680
my room mom it doesn't work like that

481
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:21,120
for me

482
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:22,800
I have to rely on other people's

483
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:24,900
feedback of course the problem with

484
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:26,100
other people's feedback is that people

485
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:29,790
are liars

486
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:31,170
you look great on especially when those

487
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:32,820
people are your fans

488
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:35,130
what's the house Queen some of my throat

489
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:36,270
mother I'll die for you oh my god or

490
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:38,130
when they're your haters

491
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:40,650
you're disgusting a giant collarbone

492
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:42,750
Nazi was a man out of thousand paces I

493
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:45,540
guess I'll never know whether I'm pretty

494
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:47,130
or not but I can estimate like I have

495
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:49,530
figured out that I'm too pretty for

496
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:51,450
Twitter but I'm not sure yet if I'm

497
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:53,550
pretty enough for Instagram it's hard

498
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:55,440
being a six I have been dipping my toes

499
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:57,300
in the Instagram water before my surgery

500
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,980
I got into a pretty good rhythm of

501
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:01,050
posting my shitty little makeup looks

502
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:03,240
and what I find an addictive about it is

503
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:05,130
this constant flow of positive comments

504
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:07,440
from other people even though I know

505
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:09,870
it's mostly flattery you invented beauty

506
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:11,010
perfect angel choke me Mommy every time

507
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:12,630
I could a comment like that I'm

508
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:14,400
perfectly aware that it's wild

509
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:16,500
exaggeration fueled by parasocial

510
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,690
delusions but I still get a head of

511
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:20,280
dopamine in my biologically female brain

512
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:22,140
and the intoxicating thing about

513
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:24,540
Instagram is that the embellishment of

514
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:27,000
the truth is a two-way street thanks to

515
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:28,890
the miracle of facetune yes we finally

516
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,600
get to talk about the phones see it's a

517
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:33,150
black mirror because it's a window into

518
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:35,760
the darkness of the human soul got it

519
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:38,160
should I explain it again bones live in

520
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:39,210
a society facetune is an app that lets

521
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,279
you fix all the problems

522
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:43,380
with your face so here's an unedited pre

523
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:45,059
ffs picture of me what I would do in

524
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:47,460
face tune is smooth out the complexion

525
00:18:45,059 --> 00:18:49,529
shrink the nose a little bring the jaw

526
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:51,240
in and use the vibrance tool to make the

527
00:18:49,529 --> 00:18:52,770
eyeshadow pop it's really no more

528
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:54,390
drastic than the kinds of photo

529
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:56,070
doctoring people have been doing since

530
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:58,320
the invention of photography what's

531
00:18:56,070 --> 00:19:00,809
changed is that now everyone is doing it

532
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:02,490
to their own photos every day and I've

533
00:19:00,809 --> 00:19:04,860
noticed that when I'm in the habit of

534
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:07,110
editing my flaws out of pictures what I

535
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:09,330
look at an unedited picture of myself or

536
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:10,620
I look in the mirror my eyes go straight

537
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:13,950
to the flaws

538
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:15,960
why are my pores so big why aren't

539
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:18,179
medical scientists doing something to

540
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:20,490
stop Venice is this really a good use of

541
00:19:18,179 --> 00:19:22,440
my mental energy here comes that guilt

542
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:24,390
again instead of worrying about my pores

543
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:26,220
shouldn't I be helping stop the

544
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:27,720
impending climate catastrophe that it's

545
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:29,789
gonna destroy the planet if we don't

546
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:32,010
change the economy in like 12 years she

547
00:19:29,789 --> 00:19:33,480
I guess it's 11 years now it's just hard

548
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:36,590
to focus on climate change when there's

549
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:36,590
so much else on my mind

550
00:19:40,059 --> 00:19:44,600
he's just so cute I guess I just rather

551
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:47,450
think about the aesthetic and the

552
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:49,760
apocalypse and that's the darkness why

553
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:53,660
is my neck like two decades older than

554
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:55,370
the rest of my skin 20 Botox yeah should

555
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:57,080
I get a facelift these are the questions

556
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:58,970
that will no doubt defined the next

557
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:00,530
couple decades of my life as if it

558
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:03,080
wasn't bad enough to have to go through

559
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:05,390
a second adolescence on camera I also

560
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:07,790
have to deal with aging and thus the

561
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:10,070
ritual of skincare products here's my

562
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:12,140
daytime routine so first I'm gonna mix

563
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:14,299
the Dermalogica exfoliator with the

564
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:16,520
cleansing gel and just massage my face

565
00:20:14,299 --> 00:20:18,350
none of this is sponsored by the way

566
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:21,380
this is just me supporting corporations

567
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:22,760
out of the kindness of my heart now if

568
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:25,820
I'm not running late for something I

569
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:27,530
will do a face mask but if I'm out of

570
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:31,850
bed it's because I'm running late for

571
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:33,890
something so I've never done a face mask

572
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:36,200
now I'm gonna use a toner which is very

573
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:42,230
important now a lot of people don't know

574
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:45,020
what a toner does but look at tones okay

575
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:46,820
do you want your face to be unknown next

576
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:50,030
I'm gonna spray expensive Korean yeast

577
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:51,410
directly into my eyes I use this because

578
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:53,510
it's actually a lot cheaper than the

579
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:54,740
Japanese yeast so you're really losing

580
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:56,630
money if you don't buy it

581
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:58,460
think of the savings now I'm gonna mix a

582
00:20:56,630 --> 00:21:01,330
pump of hyaluronic acid with a couple

583
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:03,980
spritzes of organic Bulgarian rose water

584
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:06,169
you can almost smell the Bulgarian rose

585
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:07,640
fields it's enchanting it's like I'm

586
00:21:06,169 --> 00:21:09,559
there there's not enough serum in the

587
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:11,360
world for this neck leather I use this

588
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:15,410
moisturizer because Gigi gorgeous told

589
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:17,330
me to and I do everything Gigi says

590
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:19,760
I know it seems like a lot of products

591
00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:22,040
but once you get locked into a serious

592
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:23,480
skincare collection the tendency is to

593
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:24,800
push it as far as you can and I feel

594
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:27,440
like I'm forgetting something a

595
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:29,720
sunscreen I'm not really sure what this

596
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:31,190
does we can probably skip it and I'm

597
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:35,810
just gonna finish it all off with some

598
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:38,390
more expensive mist yes god I love a

599
00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:40,700
good facial I am so [ __ ] wet right

600
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:43,120
now so after all these products does my

601
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:46,640
skin look clearer younger more toned

602
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:49,310
well it's hard to say for sure but it

603
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,780
certainly is moist this is the part

604
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:52,880
where I usually just stare at my own

605
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:54,620
face for ten minutes and contemplate the

606
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:57,280
futility of my struggle against the

607
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:57,280
ravages of time

608
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:11,800
I'm fine that's fits fine this is fine

609
00:22:09,549 --> 00:22:14,890
it's fine

610
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:14,890
[Music]

611
00:22:16,179 --> 00:22:23,450
vanitas Vanette heart'll @ omnia vanitas

612
00:22:19,789 --> 00:22:24,880
for dust thou art and unto dust shalt

613
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:28,370
thou return

614
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:36,260
leastwise i shall bequeath a female

615
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:39,529
skull so isn't beauty supposed to be fun

616
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:42,230
I'm not having fun right now why am I

617
00:22:39,529 --> 00:22:44,419
not having fun I guess I just don't feel

618
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:45,740
beautiful and I know a lot of people

619
00:22:44,419 --> 00:22:47,809
think I'm pretty and I know a lot of

620
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:49,820
other people have it worse than me and I

621
00:22:47,809 --> 00:22:51,200
know I should be grateful and I know I'm

622
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:53,299
privileged to be able to get plastic

623
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:55,309
surgery and I know I shouldn't care so

624
00:22:53,299 --> 00:22:57,860
much about this in the first place

625
00:22:55,309 --> 00:23:00,470
but the truth is that this just eats

626
00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:03,049
away at me and I'm losing a lot of time

627
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:05,210
and life to this pain I've been kind of

628
00:23:03,049 --> 00:23:06,649
depressed to this past month and I think

629
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:09,799
part of it is that on a subconscious

630
00:23:06,649 --> 00:23:11,539
level I think I was hoping that surgery

631
00:23:09,799 --> 00:23:14,330
would completely change my self-image

632
00:23:11,539 --> 00:23:16,760
and make me like myself but it really

633
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:19,700
hasn't I mean I'm happy with the results

634
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:21,830
I'd do it all again but I still feel the

635
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:24,470
way I felt before you have to keep in

636
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:26,720
mind that surgery fixes very specific

637
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:28,669
problems like the Adam's apple problem

638
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:31,250
or the way my forehead looks in profile

639
00:23:28,669 --> 00:23:34,010
problem but it's really not a solution

640
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:36,679
to deep psychological issues I still

641
00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:38,690
don't feel beautiful and I need to face

642
00:23:36,679 --> 00:23:40,370
the fact that I'm never going to feel

643
00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:42,320
beautiful unless I change the way I

644
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:44,330
think because I'm trapped in a doom

645
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:46,490
spiral over here and if I'm ever gonna

646
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:48,679
get out I think I need to start by

647
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:50,840
forgiving myself for wanting to be

648
00:23:48,679 --> 00:23:52,610
beautiful there's lots of reasons to

649
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:55,250
want to be beautiful besides being a

650
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:57,409
shallow and vain for one beauty is

651
00:23:55,250 --> 00:24:00,350
associated with youth it's a symbol of

652
00:23:57,409 --> 00:24:02,539
life of defiance of death that's a

653
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:05,510
profound thing to be concerned about see

654
00:24:02,539 --> 00:24:07,580
I'm not a bimbo I'm a poet beauty is

655
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:09,500
also associated with moral worth the

656
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:11,210
beautiful princess versus the evil hag

657
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:12,679
there's studies showing that

658
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:14,570
conventionally attractive people are

659
00:24:12,679 --> 00:24:16,390
more likely to be assumed to be happy

660
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:17,890
healthy and trustworthy they're more

661
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:20,170
likely to be hired so it's not just

662
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:22,960
about Instagram likes this is serious

663
00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:25,600
stuff and we the woke we're all aware of

664
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,890
this we know that beauty is power that

665
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,840
beauty is political

666
00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:30,430
we know that beauty standards come from

667
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:32,980
the people with privilege in an unequal

668
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:34,990
Society we know it's unjust that being

669
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:37,150
light-skinned assists able-bodied or

670
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:39,760
thin is considered more attractive than

671
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:41,770
being dark-skinned trans disabled or 5

672
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:43,960
we know that female beauty matters so

673
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:45,700
much because patriarchy we know that our

674
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:48,220
obsession with beauty is being provoked

675
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:49,870
by advertising the cosmetic industry and

676
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:52,150
beauty influencers who are trying to

677
00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:53,890
sell as products we know we know we know

678
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:56,170
all this because we've all been sitting

679
00:24:53,890 --> 00:24:58,690
around critiquing it for decades

680
00:24:56,170 --> 00:25:01,180
because that's what leftists do we

681
00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:03,430
critique things we are finely tuned

682
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:06,040
detectors of racism sexism ableism

683
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:08,710
fatphobia transphobia and capitalism

684
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:11,290
Ronnie Mack we notice an injustice we

685
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:14,260
problematize it we critique it and then

686
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:16,060
we cancel it but what's next when we're

687
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:18,460
done critiquing things what are we

688
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:20,200
supposed to do because I'm aware that

689
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:22,300
conventional beauty standards are a

690
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:24,460
racist sexist ablest fad phobic

691
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:25,930
transphobic social construct designed to

692
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:28,300
preserve power relations and sell

693
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:30,430
products but does that awareness mean I

694
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:33,640
desire any less to be conventionally

695
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:35,320
beautiful well no I want am more than

696
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:37,360
ever the problem is that the

697
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:40,150
intellectual exercise of critiquing

698
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:42,820
things doesn't usually affect my desires

699
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:45,280
very much so what am I supposed to do

700
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:47,110
sit here in silent contemplation until

701
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:48,520
my desires finally align themselves with

702
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:50,080
the interests of the International

703
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:52,360
proletarian revolution

704
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:54,070
oh [ __ ] the revolution I want to be a

705
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:57,040
pretty rich girl I don't want to be

706
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:59,200
content to be GG gorgeous fighting

707
00:25:57,040 --> 00:26:01,240
fascists on YouTube was an idea I came

708
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:03,250
up with when I was a male alcoholic

709
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:04,780
unfortunately America needs the Contra

710
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:06,880
points right now more than it needs a

711
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:09,520
thirty-year-old GG gorges impersonator

712
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:10,420
so I guess I'm stuck with it maybe it's

713
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:12,340
for the best

714
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:14,680
critiquing a society may not change our

715
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:17,650
desires but it can motivate us to change

716
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:21,240
society and changing society can change

717
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:22,480
our desires so how do we change society

718
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:24,790
revolution

719
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:27,070
well sure revolution depending on what

720
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:29,140
happens in 2020 I'll think of grabbing a

721
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:30,910
brick myself but failing that I

722
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:32,830
thinks there are ways we can work to

723
00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:34,780
loosen the grip of restrictive beauty

724
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:36,430
standards without the futility of trying

725
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:38,680
to stop caring how we look

726
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:40,540
I do think representation matters and I

727
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:42,370
think having a visible Beauty icons who

728
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:44,890
are dark-skinned or trans or gender

729
00:26:42,370 --> 00:26:47,710
non-conforming or disabled or fat or

730
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:48,460
over 35 or influencers makes a big

731
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:50,110
difference

732
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:52,660
Beauty standards are social constructs

733
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:54,400
and social constructs can change that's

734
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:57,070
why it's so important to recognize that

735
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:59,050
influencers are just as valid as other

736
00:26:57,070 --> 00:27:01,210
celebrities for the promise changing

737
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:03,490
society is that it takes a long time in

738
00:27:01,210 --> 00:27:05,560
this video is almost over where I can

739
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:08,590
see an escape from my particular doom

740
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:11,200
spiral is in style as an alternative

741
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:13,120
ideal to beauty you can be stylish at

742
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:15,130
any age you can be stylish whether you

743
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:17,410
pass or not style is a way of

744
00:27:15,130 --> 00:27:19,570
cultivating a personal aesthetic that

745
00:27:17,410 --> 00:27:21,340
you have complete control over it's like

746
00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:24,130
art and that originality

747
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:26,110
is a virtue style is an individual

748
00:27:24,130 --> 00:27:28,420
aesthetic unlike the collective

749
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:30,010
aesthetic of beauty standards as the

750
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:32,830
poet Wordsworth said about artistic

00:27:30,010 --> 00:27:34,750
appreciation every author as far as he

752
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:37,360
is great and at the same time original

00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:40,240
has had the task of creating the taste

754
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:41,710
by which he is to be enjoyed so even if

755
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:43,990
you don't conform to conventional beauty

756
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:47,110
standards through the power of original

757
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:49,080
style you can create the taste by which

758
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:51,700
your unique beauty is to be appreciated

759
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:53,800
society may frown upon us six-foot

760
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:56,410
[ __ ] but if I know I'm dressed well

761
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:59,410
or my makeup is smudged I can easily

762
00:27:56,410 --> 00:28:02,170
abide any comment and he stare I can be

763
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:04,750
misgendered a Dairy Queen for all I care

764
00:28:02,170 --> 00:28:07,120
it does not matter I can strut with

765
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:09,600
confidence because I am basking in the

766
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:12,820
regal knowledge of my own aesthetic

767
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:15,310
superiority bow before me peasants I

768
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:22,180
proclaim to the drive-through window for

769
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:24,520
I am serving a lurk so I guess that's

770
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:26,950
the solution I can't believe I

771
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:28,240
single-handedly added capitalism now

772
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:30,760
does that mean I'm not gonna get a lot

773
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:32,620
of expensive plastic surgery [ __ ] no

774
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:35,230
what do you people think I am some kind

775
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:37,870
of transgender mother Teresa god damned

776
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:40,120
the audacity of you people the hubris

777
00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:42,450
look I need plastic surgery because I

778
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:44,340
have no style in fact after the month

00:28:42,450 --> 00:28:46,770
had you should be grateful I'm wearing

780
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:48,720
clothes at all so that's it for me I

781
00:28:46,770 --> 00:28:51,330
guess I have nothing but the decay of

782
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:52,950
time and age to look forward to I guess

783
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:55,020
I'll just have to find my self-worth and

784
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:59,020
cultivating kindness intelligence and

00:28:55,020 --> 00:29:32,229
