1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,279
so I've been reading the Twilight Saga a

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,120
series of vampire romance novels by

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:11,440
someone called Stephanie Meyer and I

4
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:13,320
have oh just a couple thoughts I know a

5
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:15,639
lot has been said about Twilight but

6
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:18,240
this is a complex work there's depths to

7
00:00:15,639 --> 00:00:20,920
Twilight that we as a society haven't

8
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:23,199
even begun to explore so let's get into

9
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:24,960
it most of you know what Twilight is but

10
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:27,320
I should explain the basics for new

11
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:30,199
people Stephanie Meyer was by all

12
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:33,840
accounts a boor Mormon housewife when on

13
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:36,160
June 2nd 2003 around 4: in the morning

14
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,640
she awoke from a vivid dream about a

15
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:41,200
girl and a boy in a meadow having this

16
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,239
conversation about how they were in love

17
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,640
and the difficulties in that because he

18
00:00:43,239 --> 00:00:47,360
wanted to kill her he was a vampire a

19
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:48,879
boy and a girl in the meadow having this

20
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,360
conversation about how they were in love

21
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:52,239
and the difficulties in that because he

22
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:54,879
wanted to kill her he was a vampire that

23
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:57,680
dream became the first of four novels

24
00:00:54,879 --> 00:01:00,239
Twilight New Moon eclipse and Breaking

25
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:03,239
Dawn which were made into five films in

26
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:05,199
2015 Stephanie published life and death

27
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:07,520
a gender swapped reimagining of the

28
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:10,080
first novel yes she transgendered

29
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:12,880
Twilight Twilight has gone woke and in

30
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:15,200
2020 she published midnight sun which is

31
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:17,360
just the first novel again but from

32
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,880
Dracula's perspective Twilight has been

33
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:22,880
on Trend again recently I mean I'm

34
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:25,040
talking about it so honestly it was more

35
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:27,320
on Trend when I started this video but

36
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,360
the script took me 18 months Twilight

37
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:32,000
took me 3 months to write so in the

38
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:34,119
2000s these books about a teenage girl

39
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,240
being seduced by various creatures of

40
00:01:34,119 --> 00:01:40,040
the night spent 235 weeks on the best

41
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:42,920
seller list for children and as you can

42
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:45,360
imagine there was discourse vampires

43
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:47,200
need love too that is world news for

44
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,360
this Sunday I'm John Burman for all of

45
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,960
us at ABC news thanks for watching good

46
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,240
night Twilight's one of those pop

47
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:55,520
culture phenomena from the 2000s that

48
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:57,520
was intensely loved and then intensely

49
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,560
hated and then 10 years later it got

50
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,920
re-evaluated and everyone's like do we

51
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:05,600
really need to hate this thing so much

52
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:07,399
you know like gay people or 9/11 some

53
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:10,399
critics have suggested that Twilight was

54
00:02:07,399 --> 00:02:12,160
hated so much because of misogyny and

55
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:16,000
that's definitely true you know people

56
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,000
love to hate whatever teenage girls are

57
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:21,519
into Jacob I remember when Twilight came

58
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:24,560
out boys really hated that Stephanie

59
00:02:21,519 --> 00:02:27,080
Meyer had feminized vampire lore by

60
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:31,760
making Edward Sparkle you know cuz Count

61
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:35,200
Dracula was always so Butch you should

62
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:37,519
clue the and yet the truly devoted

63
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:39,959
Twilight haters have always been women

64
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:42,319
Twilight is a romance novel and as long

65
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:44,800
as romance novels have existed women

66
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:47,519
have always been the majority of readers

67
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,319
but also the harshest critics hating on

68
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:52,800
romance novels is as much a part of

69
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:55,519
feminine culture as reading them in 1856

70
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:59,319
yes video essays are pretentious yes

71
00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:01,879
it's very funny let's all laugh in 1856

72
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:04,000
maryan Evans known by her masculine pen

73
00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:05,680
name George Elliot and often considered

74
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,360
one of the greatest novelists of all

75
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:10,280
time wrote an essay called silly novels

76
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:12,920
by lady novelists in which she

77
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:15,239
complained that lady novelists write

78
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:18,360
unrealistic wish fulfillment fantasy

79
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:20,640
schlock with absurd Mary Sue self-insert

80
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:22,480
protagonists who every man falls in love

81
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,360
with you know all the same complaints

82
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,400
that people make today about romance

83
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:29,120
fiction it is clear that they write in

84
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,280
elegant BDO with violet colored ink and

85
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,120
a ruby

86
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:34,680
that they must be entirely indifferent

87
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:37,159
to Publishers accounts and inexperienced

88
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:39,200
in every form of poverty except Poverty

89
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:41,720
of brains there is a level of

90
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:44,040
internalized misogyny in this the not

91
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:46,360
likee other girls urge to identify with

92
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:49,000
men and share in men's contempt for

93
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:50,840
women that is misogyny but to Simply

94
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,200
dismiss hatred of Twilight as

95
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:55,319
misogynistic is too simple because the

96
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,680
criticism is usually not just that

97
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:59,920
Twilight is feminine and frivolous that

98
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:03,680
it's written with violet colored ink and

99
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:06,680
Ruby pen but also that vampire romance

100
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:08,239
intertwines love and violence here was

101
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,879
this guy and he was in love with her but

102
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:13,159
he wanted to kill her and that Twilight

103
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:16,479
is therefore somehow dangerous is this

104
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:19,079
true is Twilight dangerous well Edward

105
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:21,479

106
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:24,400

00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:29,560
killed people before I've killed people

109
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:32,000
before he wanted to kill you I wanted to

part one

130
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:25,280
fiction it has been said that Edward

131
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:27,919
Cullen is an

132
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:31,199
abuser but that's an understatement he's

133
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:32,919
not just an abuser he's a serial killer

134
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:35,600
I've killed people

135
00:05:32,919 --> 00:05:38,520
before many people are Disturbed that

136
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:41,600
Twilight is a romance and yet the hero

137
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:44,080
is dangerous and obsessive and capable

138
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:46,800
of violence what if I'm not the hero

139
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:48,560
what if I'm the bad guy in other words

140
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,960
they're Disturbed that it's the average

141
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:55,520
romance novel I don't have the strength

142
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:58,400
to stay away from you anymore and no not

143
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:00,639
every romance novel has a bad boy hero

144
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:03,000
but it's one of the most common tropes

145
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:06,160
vampires Need Love Too critics point to

146
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,560
things like the age Gap I'm 109 maybe I

147
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:11,639
shouldn't be dating such an old man it's

148
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:14,440
gross and the stalking so you followed

149
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:16,919
me I like watching you sleep and the

150
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:19,720
gaslighting you hit your head I think

151
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:21,680
you're confused I know what I saw it's

152
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:23,800
the fluoresence and when Twilight was at

153
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,880
the peak of popularity there were all

154
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,919
these articles a hand ringing about the

155
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:30,639
potential of all this to corrupt the

156
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:33,800
youth Twilight is not not feminist said

157
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:36,120
the guardian it's female masochism 50

158
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:38,360
shades for teenage girls except with

159
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:40,319
vampires all these articles that cited

160
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:42,080
the same live Journal post that went

161
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,720
down a checklist from the National

162
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:47,039
Domestic Violence Hotline to prove that

163
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:49,599
Edward Cullen is an

164
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:51,880
abuser there's always some version of

165
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:54,560
this discourse going on women are

166
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:57,960
reading the wrong books the books that

167
00:06:54,560 --> 00:07:00,800
women read are dangerous in the 2000s it

168
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:03,919
was Twilight and in the 2010s it was the

169
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:05,720
Twilight fanfiction 50 Shades of Gray at

170
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:09,240
the time I'm making this video it's a

171
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:12,000
novelist called Colleen Hoover Who Sold

172
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:14,360
6 trillion books about dangerous alpha

173
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,560
males named Riley I promise that in

174
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:19,400
whatever year you're watching this video

175
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:22,199
there's currently some lady novelist

176
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:25,039
who's caused an outrage writing stories

177
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:28,240
about a dangerous wealthy controlling

178
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:31,280
alpha male he doesn't do romance I don't

179
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:34,160
do Romance but the female protagonist

180
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:36,840
awakens his capacity for Love at the

181
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:39,440
same time as he awakens her desire for

182
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:41,919
sex now I don't want to dismiss the

183
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:44,759
feelings of people who find this kind of

184
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:47,800
romance disturbing I think it's healthy

185
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:50,680
and normal to be uncomfortable whenever

186
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:52,919
sexuality and violence are intertwined

187
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:55,039
so I'm not exactly disagreeing with

188
00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:58,479
these critics of Twilight and of dark

189
00:07:55,039 --> 00:08:01,280
romance in general I'm yes anding them

190
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:04,400
yes Edward Cullen is creepy he's a

191
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:06,840
vampire if Edward Cullen were real I

192
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:10,120
would log onto Twitter and I would

193
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:13,319
cancel that vampire I'd call the police

194
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:15,960
and I would say hello 911 I'd like to

195
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:19,319
report a coven of vampires outside Forks

196
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:24,000
Washington yes they've smashed many

197
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:27,360
salads yes Edward is problematic yes and

198
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:30,120
Edward is not real right he can't hurt

199
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:32,680
you it's going to be okay Edward Cullen

200
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:35,240
is a fictional character in a woman's

201
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:38,240
fantasy and I do feel that that is

202
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:39,959
relevant to how we analyze his behavior

203
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,519
the main line of argument against

204
00:08:39,959 --> 00:08:45,480
Twilight is that this type of story

205
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:48,200
normalizes and romanticizes abusive

206
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:51,680
relationship Dynamics it's a monkey see

207
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:54,720
monkey do theory of media analysis this

208
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:58,920
moralistic Cinema Sins thing everyone is

211
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:08,079
ding this idea that if people read Rao

212
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:11,320
fanfiction this will somehow normalize

213
00:09:08,079 --> 00:09:13,680
relationships with Sith Lords are twins

214
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:16,560
going to jump off a cliff because Bella

215
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:19,360
does I say the obsessive moral policing

216
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:22,279
of the romance genre as a continuation

217
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:24,519
of literally centuries of concern that

218
00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:27,120
women are reading the wrong kinds of

219
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:30,200
books when I was young in the 18th

220
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:33,240
century ladies were advised to read what

221
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:35,760
we called conduct books such as Thomas

222
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:38,040
gisburn an inquiry into the duties of

223
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:40,920
the female sex which instructed the

224
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:43,480
reader in proper feminine virtues

225
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:46,440
doesn't that sound exciting to indulge

226
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:49,959
in a practice of reading novels is

227
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:52,480
liable to produce mischievous effects a

228
00:09:49,959 --> 00:09:55,040
certain kind of person has always

229
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:57,680
considered romance novels sort of

230
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:59,560
decadent and salacious some of this

231
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:03,000
comes down to a question about the the

232
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:05,040
purpose of art is Art supposed to be a

233
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,680
moral education that instructs the

234
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:11,079
reader in proper virtuous conduct or B a

235
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:14,480
mirror of reality that reflects life as

236
00:10:11,079 --> 00:10:16,839
it really is or C Escapist fantasy

237
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,519
that's primarily entertainment

238
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:20,839
throughout the history of the novel The

239
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:24,800
genre has often been dismissed as

240
00:10:20,839 --> 00:10:28,399
Escapist fantasy literary opium an

241
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:31,800
addictive corrupting influence the first

242
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:35,040
bestselling English novel ever was a

243
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:38,320
romance published in 1740 by Samuel

244
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:41,160
Richardson called Pamela or virtue

245
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:44,040
rewarded Pamela tells the story of a

246
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:46,839
virtuous 15-year-old girl named Pamela

247
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:49,600
Andrews who employed as a maid servant

248
00:10:46,839 --> 00:10:52,440
by the wealthy pervert Mr B who

249
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:55,279
repeatedly attempts to seduce her kidnap

250
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:58,200
her sneak into her room at night and the

251
00:10:55,279 --> 00:11:00,800
whole time Pamela is like nay I Shan

252
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:03,040
aquest this Li sensious rake for my

253
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:05,000
innocence and virtue are more dear to me

254
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:08,079
than my life and if the cost be my

255
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,160
Felicity so be it for I sh subject my

256
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:12,720
poor mother and father to the ignominy

257
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:15,279
of in the end Mr B is so impressed with

258
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:18,040
Pamela's virtue that he reforms his

259
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:20,519
rakish ways and marries her which is

260
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:22,720
supposed to be the reward I guess for

261
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:25,920
Pamela's chased Behavior it's a

262
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:28,680
Cinderella rags to Rich's fantasy with a

263
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:31,120
prince charming who's not so Charming

264
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:34,560
Pamela is kind of like an 18th century

265
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:36,560
50 Shades of Gray Mr B will see you now

266
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:38,959
you could also make an argument that

267
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:41,240
Pamela was the novel with the first

268
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:44,440
modern fandom there was Pamela

269
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:48,519
fanfiction and Pamela merch there was

270
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:51,560
discourse between pamus and anti- pamus

271
00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:54,720
about the sincerity of Pamela's virtue

272
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:57,959
anti- pamus wrote parody novels like

273
00:11:54,720 --> 00:12:00,760
Eliza Haywood's anti- Pamela or fed

274
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:04,839
innocence Detective wow what a Savage

275
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:07,839
burn and Henry fielding's

276
00:12:04,839 --> 00:12:10,519
shamela both of which reframe Pamela as

277
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:12,680
a gold digging social climber this must

278
00:12:10,519 --> 00:12:14,519
have been an affront Samuel Richardson

279
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:16,399
who makes his position clear on the

280
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:18,839
cover page claiming that he published

281
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:21,399
Pamela quote in order to cultivate the

282
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:24,839
principles of virtue and religion in the

283
00:12:21,399 --> 00:12:27,279
minds of the Youth of both sexes so in

284
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:29,760
1740 there was already this tension

285
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:32,320
between two purposes of Art is Art

286
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:34,639
supposed to inflame the mind or is it

287
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,760
supposed to cultivate the principles of

288
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:40,320
virtue and religion in the minds of the

289
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:42,639
youth personally I prefer to be inflamed

290
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:45,560
I want to feel good I don't want to be

291
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:48,519
good and Stephanie Meyer apparently

292
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:50,959
agrees I never stop and think you know

293
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:53,440
oh this is a role model for people it's

294
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:56,199
fiction it is fiction whatever we think

295
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:58,440
of its morality Pamela became the

296
00:12:56,199 --> 00:13:01,680
template for romance novels where a

297
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:04,440
young inexperienced impoverished girl

298
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:07,800
becomes the object of Fascination for an

299
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:10,360
older richer man with a dangerous edge

300
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:13,040
in the 19th century Pride and Prejudice

301
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:14,880
and Jane air both fit this description

302
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:17,279
The Pride and Prejudice is obviously

303
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:20,279
much more agreeable to 21st century

304
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:22,360
morality than Pamela Fitz William Darcy

305
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:25,240
is not Elizabeth Bennett's sexually

306
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:27,160
abusive boss he's not even a vampire you

307
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:29,519
should have thought of that Jane Austin

308
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:32,040
what are you doing in the 20th Century

309
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:34,880
the term romance novel became associated

310
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:38,079
with mass Market paperback romances

311
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:40,839
derogatorily known as bodice rippers

312
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:43,800
like Joanna Lindsay's gentle Rogue with

313
00:13:40,839 --> 00:13:46,040
the classic Fabio clinch on the cover

314
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:48,320
they don't do covers like this anymore

315
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:50,800
here's the new edition of gentle Rogue

316
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:53,800
with the most boring cover imaginable

317
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:56,040
red ver red ver to the clinch covers we

318
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:57,959
used to be a country a proper country

319
00:13:56,040 --> 00:14:02,199
the genzi equivalent of bodice rippers

320
00:13:57,959 --> 00:14:04,160
is like Wat BTS werewolf thick how many

321
00:14:02,199 --> 00:14:06,320
Mafia twinks can there be the

322
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:08,360
specifically feminist criticism of

323
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:11,079
romance novels goes back at least to

324
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:13,839
Germaine Greer who included a long rant

325
00:14:11,079 --> 00:14:16,320
about them in her 1970 Manifesto the

326
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:19,120
female unic in which she condemns

327
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:21,720
romance readers as women cherishing the

328
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:23,519
chains of their own bondage the point

329
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:26,560
I'm trying to make is there's a

330
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:29,480
historical continuity from Pamela to

331
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:31,519
Twilight Stephanie Meyer's contribution

332
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:33,880
is that she took the classic romance

333
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:37,399
formula combined it with the lurid

334
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:39,560
sexiness of Dracula and then Mormon ised

335
00:14:37,399 --> 00:14:43,000
it to the point it became appealing to

336
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:45,839
21st century teenagers and moms another

337
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:48,600
continuity from Pamela to Twilight is

338
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:51,120
the persistent anxiety of critics that

339
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:54,920
the romance novel is somehow corrupting

340
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:57,160
the youth or enslaving women or both

341
00:14:54,920 --> 00:15:00,160
Aaron meanly worries about Twilight

342
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:02,560
quote some girls might expect their love

343
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:05,160
life to look just like Bella's Now

344
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:08,000
That's What I Call scary naha Gandhi

345
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:10,279
says Bella is essentially a romanticized

346
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,920
version of all our worst weakest

347
00:15:10,279 --> 00:15:15,079
impulses put up on a pedestal and that

348
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:17,120
makes her dangerous with a lot of

349
00:15:15,079 --> 00:15:19,759
criticism of Twilight you get the

350
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:22,399
impression that the critic both senses

351
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:24,759
the attraction to Twilight and is

352
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:26,800
uncomfortable with that attraction and

353
00:15:24,759 --> 00:15:29,560
the anxious hand ringing is a

354
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:32,360
manifestation of that ambivalence even

355
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:34,279
Germaine Greer admits quote I cannot

356
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:37,199
claim to be fully emancipated from the

357
00:15:34,279 --> 00:15:39,120
dream that some enormous man say 6'6

358
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:41,319
heavily shouldered and so forth to match

359
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:43,240
will crush me to his Tweeds look down

360
00:15:41,319 --> 00:15:45,040
into my eyes and leave the taste of

361
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:47,240
heaven or The Scorch of his passion on

362
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:49,800
my waiting lips remember what they took

363
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:52,959
from you I want to argue that both the

364
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:56,240
fascination with vampire romance and the

365
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:58,519
discomfort with it are natural reactions

366
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:01,360
to something paradoxical in the

367
00:15:58,519 --> 00:16:03,639
experience erence of erotic love itself

368
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:07,240
Twilight is everything we fear in

369
00:16:03,639 --> 00:16:10,360
sexuality the excess the irrationality

370
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:13,160
the transgression the violence the loss

371
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:15,199
of self-possession the violation of

372
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:17,319
boundaries none of them belong to

373
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:19,800
themselves anymore and the sickest part

374
00:16:17,319 --> 00:16:22,399
is the genes tell them they're happy

375
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:24,880
about it Stephanie Meyer is continuing

376
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:28,000
an ancient mythological tradition of

377
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:30,680
Storytelling that equates Love and Death

378
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:34,560
think Hades and and pany the temptation

379
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:37,759
of Eve Swan Lake Romeo and Juliet like

380
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:41,000
Romeo and Juliet Twilight is in moderate

381
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:43,240
Teenage Love escalated to the point of

382
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:46,319
death and you could argue that Romeo and

383
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:49,959
Juliet are closer to equals where Edward

384
00:16:46,319 --> 00:16:52,880
and Bella are predator in prey the lion

385
00:16:49,959 --> 00:16:55,639
fell in love with the lamb so the lion

386
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:58,160
fell in love with the lamb but look at

387
00:16:55,639 --> 00:17:00,600
the big picture in Twilight the lamb

388
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:03,279
doesn't stay a lamb by the end of the

389
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:05,760
story she becomes a lion she's a

390
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:08,720
powerful vampire with a rich husband and

391
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:11,079
a magical demon baby yes Edward is a

392
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:13,839
dangerous predator but his power is

393
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:18,039
subservient to his love for Bella and

394
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:21,880
it's deployed for her protection I feel

395
00:17:18,039 --> 00:17:24,679
very protective of you she becomes

396
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:27,720
powerful because he loves her this is

397
00:17:24,679 --> 00:17:30,280
not a story of becoming prey it's a

398
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:33,280
story of rising to the level of the

399
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:36,000
Predator behind every Cinderella fantasy

400
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:38,880
is a female Will To

401
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,480
Power the debates about romance fiction

402
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:44,320
are not frivolous they concern the

403
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:46,960
deepest questions in women's lives what

404
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:50,039
does happiness look like what do we want

405
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:52,400
from Love from sex what does it mean to

406
00:17:50,039 --> 00:17:57,320
succeed as a woman what does it mean to

407
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:57,320
be a woman what does it mean to be

408
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:03,039
anything why is is Twilight like this to

409
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:06,240
answer these questions and more I read

410
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:10,240
the entire Twilight Saga twice I watched

411
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:13,320
the movies 37 times I read 3,000 pages

412
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:15,799
of psychoanalysis and 8,000 pages of

413
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:18,039
queer and radical feminist Theory now

414
00:18:15,799 --> 00:18:20,320
some people say that I'm overly fixated

415
00:18:18,039 --> 00:18:22,799
on Twilight that mother is having

416
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:25,240
another episode and maybe some of those

417
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:27,280
people are my psychiatrist and maybe

418
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:29,400
they're trying to put me on mood

419
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:31,679
stabilizers but here's by those people

420
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,679
are

421
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:38,679
wrong part two desire one way to State

422
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:41,880
the question the mystery we're trying to

423
00:18:38,679 --> 00:18:43,960
solve is why would someone romanticize

424
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:46,880
the relationship between a vampire and a

425
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:49,520
human between a predator and his prey

426
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:52,039
isn't this problematic with its age gaps

427
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:54,760
and its power dynamics one answer is

428
00:18:52,039 --> 00:18:56,799
that yes it is problematic and it's

429
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:59,280
problematic because in order for a story

430
00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:02,320
to have a plot there needs to be a

431
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:05,360
problem what is sometimes known as a

432
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:08,240
conflict conflict creates tension both

433
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:10,880
romantic and narrative and in Twilight

434
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:13,120
Edward's vampirism is the source of that

435
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:15,240
tension listen to how Stephanie Meyers

436
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:17,400
summarizes the dream that inspired

437
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:18,760
Twilight a boy and a girl in a meadow

438
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:20,400
having this conversation about how they

439
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:21,600
were in love and the difficulties in

440
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,120
that because he wanted to kill her he

441
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:26,159
was a vampire that that is a problem yes

442
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:28,159
you're right the danger of Edward

443
00:19:26,159 --> 00:19:30,840
wanting to kill Bella adds to the

444
00:19:28,159 --> 00:19:33,200
tension it makes the story more exciting

445
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:35,919
a common complaint from Twilight haters

446
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:37,679
is that the first book has no plot I

447
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:40,320
feel like this complaint comes from

448
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:42,600
people who don't understand romance as a

449
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:44,400
genre it's like that Goodreads review of

450
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:46,600
Pride and Prejudice just a bunch of

451
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:49,000
people going to each other's houses

452
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:51,679
strictly speaking true but this person's

453
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:54,400
idea of plot is too narrow they think

454
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:56,159
that plot just means physical action

455
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,919
even Stephanie Meyers seems to think

456
00:19:56,159 --> 00:20:00,039
this to some extent because there's a

457
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:02,600
lot of what I would consider gratuitous

458
00:20:00,039 --> 00:20:04,640
action forced into these stories the

459
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:06,520
last movie ends with this giant battle

460
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:08,720
between the Mormon vampires and their

461
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:10,919
army of ethnic stereotypes good

462
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:14,320
missionary work I guess and their sworn

463
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:17,039
enemies the volui the Italian scum the

464
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:18,760
Vol are like a Mormons idea of Catholics

465
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:20,720
you know they live in the Vatican they

466
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:24,000
speak

467
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,000
Italian they're

468
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:32,000
gay I do love the V they're my kind of

469
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:33,600
Vamps I guess it was the 2000s and

470
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,760
everything had to have giant battle

471
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:38,120
scenes because Lord of the Rings why

472
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:39,880
can't a romance just be a romance Pride

473
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:41,760
and Prejudice didn't end with Darcy

474
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:46,159
hunting down Wickam in a high-speed

475
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:46,159
Carriage Chase isn't my husband a fine

476
00:20:47,159 --> 00:20:52,520
Horseman romance stories can have action

477
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:57,080
elements but they're primarily driven by

478
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:59,840
emotion pining longing yearning even the

479
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:02,320
plot of a romance is always desire

480
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:04,720
deferred in her natural history of the

481
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:07,400
romance novel romance scholar Pamela

482
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:09,559
reges says quote the barrier is the

483
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:11,720
conflict in a romance novel it is

484
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:14,279
anything that keeps the union of heroine

485
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:16,919
and hero from taking place in Pride and

486
00:21:14,279 --> 00:21:19,320
Prejudice the barrier is in the title

487
00:21:16,919 --> 00:21:21,279
it's Darcy's pride and Elizabeth's

488
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:23,919
Prejudice and Mrs Bennett certainly

489
00:21:21,279 --> 00:21:26,360
isn't helping either B's wealth is

490
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:28,320
nothing to his lower your voice woman

491
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:30,720
everyone can hear you I don't care if he

492
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:33,279
does in Twilight you may be thinking the

493
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:35,640
barrier is Jacob hey beautiful because

494
00:21:33,279 --> 00:21:38,039
there are triangular moments between

495
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:40,480
Jacob Bella and Edward but let's face

496
00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:43,279
the facts Team Jacob never stood a

497
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:45,360
chance it's always been him the barrier

498
00:21:43,279 --> 00:21:47,559
is really just that Edward wants to

499
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:49,240
drink that girl's Sweet Blood and who

500
00:21:47,559 --> 00:21:52,559
can blame him I've been thinking about

501
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:55,320
taking a sip myself in Twilight blood

502
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:57,960
drinking is a metaphor for sinful Lust

503
00:21:55,320 --> 00:22:01,279
For violent lust Edward's inner conflict

504
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:03,760
is between lust and love he loves Bella

505
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:05,960
but he lusts for her blood and because

506
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:08,360
his blood lust will kill her he has to

507
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:10,279
resist the temptation of blood lust in

508
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:12,120
order to love Bella I still don't know

509
00:22:10,279 --> 00:22:14,360
if I can control myself that's the

510
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:18,120
barrier he overcomes it's an internal

511
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:20,679
barrier a psychological conflict stop

512
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:23,360
Find the Will the barrier is essential

513
00:22:20,679 --> 00:22:26,279
to romance stories because narrative is

514
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:28,520
sustained by tension and so is romantic

515
00:22:26,279 --> 00:22:31,200
love now I should explain that by Roman

516
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:34,120
itic love I mean what the ancient Greeks

517
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:36,559
called Aeros Aeros is the ancient Greek

518
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:38,919
personification of erotic love that

519
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:40,720
archery twink better known by his Roman

520
00:22:38,919 --> 00:22:42,600
name Cupid and I'm not just bringing

521
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:45,400
this up to be pretentious though that is

522
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:47,960
a benefit in English the word love is

523
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:50,159
awkwardly non-specific you love your

524
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:53,799
friends you love your husband you love

525
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:56,720
your dad you love your dog you love God

526
00:22:53,799 --> 00:22:58,960
you love Twizzlers love love love as if

527
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:01,000
it's all the same Greek has different

528
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:04,000
words for all these kinds of love

529
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:08,240
there's filia Brotherly Love Agapi

530
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:11,039
spiritual love stori familial love filaa

531
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:13,919
selflove and then there's Aeros the

532
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:16,720
problem child Aeros is the aching

533
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:20,720
passionate longing of romance novels of

534
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:22,640
sapo's poetry of Romeo and Juliet it's

535
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:25,919
similar to what the psychologist Dorothy

536
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:29,000
tenof called limerance limerance is like

537
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:31,200
an adult Crush sexual by Nature

538
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:34,480
intense to the point of obsession and

539
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:36,559
anguish Aeros or limerance or romantic

540
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:39,440
love whatever we want to call it is the

541
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:40,919
emotional impetus of The Twilight Saga

542
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:43,320
people who have never experienced

543
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:45,240
limerance will be confused by Bella's

544
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:48,440
behavior in Twilight because it's

545
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:50,840
extreme it's irrational it's obsessive

546
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:53,279
it's all consuming it's at times

547
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:55,400
masochistic in New Moon after Edward

548
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:59,360
breaks up with Bella she shrieks in

549
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:59,360
agony all through the night

550
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:03,360
and then sits in her depression chair

551
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:06,559
staring dejectedly out the window for

552
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:08,840
three consecutive months there's a

553
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:11,640
possibility meow meow meow meow meow

554
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:13,840
meow meow to an a-romantic person this

555
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:16,559
might look like Madness because it is

556
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:18,400
madness it's just not normal this

557
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:21,200
Behavior but to anyone who's been in

558
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:25,880
love it's your Madness unlike other

559
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:25,880
forms of Love erotic love is

560
00:24:26,039 --> 00:24:30,880
painful when you left you took

561
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:33,559
everything with you the absence of him

562
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:36,159
is everywhere I look the absence of him

563
00:24:33,559 --> 00:24:38,600
is everywhere I look absence is the

564
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:42,279
essential nature of erotic love because

565
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:44,799
Aeros is desire and desire is lack you

566
00:24:42,279 --> 00:24:47,039
want what you don't have the essayist

567
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:49,799
Anne Carson explores this idea in one of

568
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:52,600
my favorite books Aros the Bittersweet

569
00:24:49,799 --> 00:24:55,320
the title comes from one of saf's poems

570
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:58,360
Aeros once again limb loosener whirs me

571
00:24:55,320 --> 00:25:01,159
Sweet Bitter impossible to fight off

572
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:04,320
creature stealing up so why is AOS

573
00:25:01,159 --> 00:25:06,640
bitter well we say that a person in love

574
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:09,080
is in search of their other half in

575
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:11,320
Plato's Symposium Aristophanes tells a

576
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:13,120
myth about the origin of Love which says

577
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:16,080
that we all used to be double what we

578
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:18,480
are now round beings with four arms and

579
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:21,720
two heads and two sets of reproductive

580
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:23,799
organs until Zeus split us all in half

581
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:26,240
why is God always an abusive father

582
00:25:23,799 --> 00:25:28,320
concerning so when we fall in love we're

583
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:31,120
yearning to heal the trauma of human

584
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:33,480
human nature to be whole again yearning

585
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:35,919
is always a desire for something we feel

586
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:38,600
like we have lost and it's that ache of

587
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:41,000
loss of Separation that makes Aeros

588
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:43,720
bitter and Carson says quote Pleasure

589
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,960
and Pain at once register upon the lover

590
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:49,000
in as much as the desirability of the

591
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:52,279
love object derives in part from its

592
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:54,360
lack because desire is derived from lack

593
00:25:52,279 --> 00:25:56,960
something has to separate the lover and

594
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:59,240
the Beloved for desire to sustain itself

595
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:02,520
in romance fiction that something is the

596
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:05,840
barrier the ruse an Carson calls it the

597
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:07,799
third thing that triangulates desire the

598
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:10,679
purpose of the barrier is quote to

599
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:13,640
represent arrows as deferred defied

600
00:26:10,679 --> 00:26:17,320
obstructed hungry organized around a

601
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:19,440
radiant absence to represent AOS as lack

602
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:22,000
when the barrier is overcome when the

603
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:24,200
two lovers unite that's the end of your

604
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,360
romance novel because the narrative is

605
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:28,440
sustained by desire and desire is

606
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:31,039
sustained by separation so when the

607
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:33,200
separation ends the desire ends and

608
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:37,799
that's the end of your story The Lover's

609
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:40,200
kiss odys is home the end happily ever

610
00:26:37,799 --> 00:26:42,520
after is of course not a reality it's

611
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:45,320
just a device of romance fiction in

612
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:48,559
reality when two people in love unite is

613
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:50,480
what we call a long-term relationship

614
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:52,520
which I'm sorry if I'm the one breaking

615
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:55,200
this news to you but many long-term

616
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:57,720
relationships are not in fact happily

617
00:26:55,200 --> 00:27:00,080
ever after it's not easy to sustain

618
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:02,960
desire over years you have to keep

619
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:05,080
inventing new rues new barriers that

620
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:08,120
create the space for desire to

621
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:10,240
continuously reite successful couples

622
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:13,799
either learn to be content with a more

623
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:17,200
pragmatic non-erotic love or they're

624
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:19,360
somehow able to sustain AOS falling in

625
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:22,440
love with each other again and again but

626
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:24,559
I fear that's the exception the rule is

627
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:26,159
absence makes the heart grow fonder

628
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:29,120
another way to put this would be to say

629
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:31,520
that desire prefers the hunt to the kill

630
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:34,600
and maybe that's one reason sexuality is

631
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:36,240
often represented as predator and prey

632
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:38,480
the first shot of the first Twilight

633
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:40,640
movie is of a deer being stalked by a

634
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:43,279
predator this tells us what kind of

635
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:46,320
story it's going to be so the lion fell

636
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:49,760
in love with the lamb Edward the lion

637
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:53,679
Cullen embodies Hunter sexuality he

638
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:56,720
glares he stalks he pounces and Bella at

639
00:27:53,679 --> 00:28:00,200
least at first is his prey what a stupid

640
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:02,559
Li a similar Trope of lover as Hunter

641
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:05,039
exists on Ancient Greek earns which

642
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:07,679
often depict a lover not in possession

643
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:10,240
but in pursuit of his beloved and Carson

644
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:12,600
says quote the moment of Ideal desire on

645
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:14,799
which vay painters as well as poets are

646
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:16,760
inclined to focus is not the moment when

647
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:18,919
the two unite in happiness what is

648
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:21,200
pictured is the moment when the Beloved

649
00:28:18,919 --> 00:28:24,039
turns and runs it's the moment of

650
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:26,919
obstructed desire John Keats described

651
00:28:24,039 --> 00:28:29,080
in his ode on a Grecian earn bold lover

652
00:28:26,919 --> 00:28:31,880
never never can that thou kiss the

653
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:34,440
winning near the goal yet do not grieve

654
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:37,080
she cannot fade though thou Hast not thy

655
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:39,919
Bliss forever wil thou love and she be

656
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:42,720
fair the poet or the ear painter

657
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:45,679
captures that moment of desire for all

658
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:48,519
time the Hunter suspended in the middle

659
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:50,679
of a hunt desire is like a dog that

660
00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:53,120
wants to chase a squirrel but not to

661
00:28:50,679 --> 00:28:55,399
catch it and it may be this fugitive

662
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:57,720
element of Desire that gives rise to

663
00:28:55,399 --> 00:29:00,919
double standards where the Beloved the

664
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:03,399
one who is pursued is valued only as

665
00:29:00,919 --> 00:29:06,080
long as she is unattainable to quote an

666
00:29:03,399 --> 00:29:08,320
Carson again cuz I love her so much a

667
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:10,360
titilating triangle comes into play

668
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:12,279
between the lover the bad girl who

669
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:14,919
attracts him and the good girl who

670
00:29:12,279 --> 00:29:18,000
honors him by saying no in this kind of

671
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:22,200
dating ritual the barrier is the good

672
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:24,360
girl who is modest elusive hard to get

673
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:27,399
like in the 9s there was this Infamous

674
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:29,760
dating manual for women called the rules

675
00:29:27,399 --> 00:29:32,799
time test secrets for capturing the

676
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:35,880
heart of Mr wri it included such advice

677
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:38,000
as always end phone calls first don't

678
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:40,799
accept a Saturday night date after

679
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:43,399
Wednesday in other words play hard to

680
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:46,279
get the rules strikes many people as

681
00:29:43,399 --> 00:29:49,240
oppressively old-fashioned at best and

682
00:29:46,279 --> 00:29:50,960
straight up Psychopathic at worst and I

683
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:53,120
agree I don't think the rules should be

684
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:55,120
taken too seriously but there is a

685
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:57,720
little grain of Truth in it Simone

686
00:29:55,120 --> 00:30:00,279
deovir says the night departing for new

687
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:02,200
adventure ures offends his lady yet she

688
00:30:00,279 --> 00:30:04,399
has nothing but contempt for him if he

689
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:06,840
remains at her feet this is the torture

690
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:09,799
of impossible love to paraphrase the

691
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:12,519
psychoanalyst jacqu laon desire thinks

692
00:30:09,799 --> 00:30:16,039
it wants to be satisfied but really it

693
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:18,880
wants to go on Desiring desire is desire

694
00:30:16,039 --> 00:30:21,720
for desire Shakespeare says something

695
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:23,720
similar in Sonet 147 my love is as a

696
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:26,240
fever longing still for that which

697
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:30,000
longer nurseth the disease Shakespeare

698
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:32,799
Compares desire that is love Aeros to a

699
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,679
sickness that wants to perpetuate itself

700
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:37,080
what doesn't kill me makes me want you

701
00:30:34,679 --> 00:30:39,600
more is Taylor Swift's version of the

702
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:41,600
same thought and a song that begins

703
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:43,760
fever dream high in the quiet of the

704
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:46,399
night echoing Shakespeare's comparison

705
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:48,600
of love to a fever a desire that feeds

706
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:50,600
on its own frustration and I'm pretty

707
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:52,640
sure Taylor agrees with what I'm saying

708
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:54,840
in this video also I apologize for

709
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:57,000
criticizing her in my JK rolling video

710
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:58,760
I've since read a bunch of Tumblr posts

711
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,960
that convince me that she's gay

712
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:04,600
inspiring follow the money in an episode

713
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:07,440
of Seinfeld George castanza makes a

714
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:10,919
distinction between two types of Desire

715
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:14,519
yearning and craving do you ever yearn

716
00:31:10,919 --> 00:31:17,480
yearn do I yearn have you yearned well

717
00:31:14,519 --> 00:31:20,720
not recently I craved I crave all the

718
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:22,399
time constant craving I haven't yearned

719
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:24,080
what is the difference between yearning

720
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:25,880
and craving well let's start with

721
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:29,200
craving what kinds of things do you

722
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:32,519
crave you crave a cigarette a sandwich

723
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:34,840
an orgasm a drink you satisfy a craving

724
00:31:32,519 --> 00:31:37,279
for something but then an hour later you

725
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:40,120
crave it again so maybe craving is a

726
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:41,960
desire that can be satisfied but only

727
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:43,880
for a moment craving is like

728
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:46,760
Shakespeare's description of lust and

729
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:49,679
Sonet 129 the expensive spirit in a

730
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:52,240
waste of Shame is lust in action enjoyed

731
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:55,200
no sooner but despised straight a bliss

732
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:59,080
in proof and proved a very woe before a

733
00:31:55,200 --> 00:32:00,799
joy proposed behind a dream a poor baby

734
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:02,840
bill was really having a hard time in

735
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:04,360
those sonnets how is yearning different

736
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:06,480
from craving well maybe it's the

737
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:08,000
difference between love and lust the

738
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:11,960
difference between Shakespeare's Sonet

739
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:15,000
129 and 147 craving is enjoyed no sooner

740
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:16,799
but despised straight and yearning is a

741
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,200
fever longing still for that which

742
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:20,760
longer nurseth the disease isn't this

743
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:23,679
what Stephanie Meers really trying to

744
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:26,840
say here Edward Cullen craves blood but

745
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:29,360
he yearns for Bella it's lust against

746
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:31,919
limerance let's talk about yearning do

747
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:34,799
you ever yearn what kinds of things do

748
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:37,000
you yearn for you yearn for Union with a

749
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:40,279
person you're in love with or for Union

750
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:42,919
with God like in Psalm 63 my whole being

751
00:32:40,279 --> 00:32:45,200
Longs for you in a dry and parched land

752
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:48,159
where there is no water you yearn for

753
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:50,639
God you don't crave God no one says I

754
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:53,200
need to get my God fixed don't talk to

755
00:32:50,639 --> 00:32:55,760
me until I've had my God you yearn to

756
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:57,919
feel whole again maybe by finding your

757
00:32:55,760 --> 00:33:00,720
other half or through some kind of

758
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:03,080
shroomy Oneness or maybe Freud was right

759
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:05,519
that it's really mother who we yearn for

760
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:07,720
mother I mean we did use to be one with

761
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:09,880
her body in the womb and then they cut

762
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:11,600
the umbilical cord and they weaned you

763
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:13,720
from her breast and life has been

764
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:16,760
downhill ever

765
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:19,919
since yearning maybe you yearn for the

766
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:22,639
good old days Nostalgia a yearning for

767
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:25,399
lost time or you yearn for Nostalgia

768
00:33:22,639 --> 00:33:27,159
inverse utopian socialism think about

769
00:33:25,399 --> 00:33:29,159
the kind of leftists who talk about the

770
00:33:27,159 --> 00:33:31,159
revolution like it's the Rapture these

771
00:33:29,159 --> 00:33:33,559
people are yearning for a different time

772
00:33:31,159 --> 00:33:36,039
but it's one they imagine in the future

773
00:33:33,559 --> 00:33:38,200
yearning I think is inherently erotic

774
00:33:36,039 --> 00:33:41,039
it's not necessarily sexual but it's

775
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:43,240
erotic in the sense that unlike craving

776
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:46,440
which can be satisfied though only for a

777
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:49,080
moment yearning is a desire that can't

778
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:50,600
really be satisfied at all like you know

779
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:52,480
how no matter what you accomplish in

780
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:53,840
life you can never really be satisfied

781
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:55,880
because you always still feel the same

782
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:58,000
void inside eating away at you all the

783
00:33:55,880 --> 00:34:00,480
time well this is the reason for that we

784
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,600
all have a black hole deep inside of us

785
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:04,760
and nothing can ever really fill it some

786
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:07,399
people call it a god-shaped hole but I'm

787
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:09,399
pretty sure my god-shaped hole is shaped

788
00:34:07,399 --> 00:34:11,760
like actually I think the hole is

789
00:34:09,399 --> 00:34:13,639
flexible it kind of shapes itself to

790
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:16,000
whatever it is we think we're missing

791
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:18,079
the things we desire become symbols of

792
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,720
the whole and we come to believe that

793
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:23,200
we're yearning for this symbol an Carson

794
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:26,520
says quote who is the real subject of

795
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:29,200
most love poems not the Beloved it is

796
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:31,480
that whole now would be a good time to

797
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:33,520
admire my restraint and not making any

798
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:36,119
jokes about filling my holes very

799
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:38,159
tasteful very ladylike I know you may

800
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:40,480
praise me in the comments section now

801
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:43,119
Lon says something similar I'll quote

802
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:44,240
xi's summary because Lan is illegible if

803
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:46,119
you don't care about philosophy just

804
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:47,839
ignore these names close your eyes and

805
00:34:46,119 --> 00:34:50,159
pretend this isn't happening quote the

806
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:53,440
drive's goal to reach its object is

807
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:56,079
false it masks its true aim which is to

808
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:58,280
reproduce its own circular Movement by

809
00:34:56,079 --> 00:35:00,400
repeatedly missing its object

810
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:03,280
this is the Trap of Yearning of

811
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:06,200
unrequited love and of nostalgia you

812
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:09,320
yearn for the good old days because you

813
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:10,839
lack them they are lost time but try

814
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:12,640
explaining that to the people in the

815
00:35:10,839 --> 00:35:14,880
comments section of a '90s Fruity

817
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:21,240
golden age I miss the world when there

818
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:23,599
was still love left in it yumy

819
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:25,280
pees on second thought the Fruity

Pebbles commercial may be the only thing

821

holding this man's sanity together let's

00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:32,119
just let him have this I wish there was

823
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:35,240
a way to know you're in the good old

824
00:35:32,119 --> 00:35:37,320
days before you've actually left them we

825
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:39,280
all wish there was a way to feel like

826
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:42,720
you're in the good old days but there

827
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:44,920
isn't it's impossible why well you're

828
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:47,599
never in the good old days because you

829
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:50,079
can only yearn for what you've lost the

830
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:52,400
good old days are old because they're

831
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:54,839
gone and they're good because you

832
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:57,079
idealize what you yearn for and you only

833
00:35:54,839 --> 00:35:59,319
yearn for what you do not have your

834
00:35:57,079 --> 00:36:03,880
childhood is is dead and no amount of

tried advertising simulates Desire by

838
00:36:17,079 --> 00:36:24,319
invoking lack often yearning for beauty

839
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:27,560
Prestige and glamour glamour simply is

840
00:36:24,319 --> 00:36:29,640
the unattainable the always Out Of Reach

841
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:32,040
do you ever feel like Goldilocks in a

842
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:33,720
world where the porridge is never just

843
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:36,079
right I feel like I'm describing some

844
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:38,119
kind of pessimist's prayer you can't get

845
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:40,640
what you want and if you do it won't

846
00:36:38,119 --> 00:36:42,920
make you happy and if it does not for

847
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:45,760
long the only way to escape the cycle of

848
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:48,760
suffering the only path to Salvation is

849
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:51,800
to both like And subscribe give me your

850
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:54,319
money you know I think I crave because I

851
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:57,920
yearn suppose hypothetically someone

852
00:36:54,319 --> 00:37:00,319
named I don't know Veronica is an unre

853
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:02,920
love and suppose the pain of that drives

854
00:37:00,319 --> 00:37:05,640
Veronica hypothetically for educational

855
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:08,880
and harm reduction purposes to get a

856
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:12,079
little bit addicted

857
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:15,839
to she's craving to cope with the

858
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:18,200
yearning I like my own personal brand of

859
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:20,480
heroin what's your favorite brand of

860
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:23,319
heroin leave a comment maybe you could

861
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:26,079
visualize Cravings as like epicycles of

862
00:37:23,319 --> 00:37:28,560
the larger cycle of Yearning that orbits

863
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:30,319
around the void constant craving I

864
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:32,480
promise this is about Twilight yearning

865
00:37:30,319 --> 00:37:34,880
is Bittersweet and the bitterness of

866
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:37,640
Yearning comes from the absence at its

867
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:40,040
core from the futility of grasping at

868
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:42,240
something always Out Of Reach the

869
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:44,319
absence of him is everywhere I look but

870
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:47,760
what about the sweetness the sweetness

871
00:37:44,319 --> 00:37:47,760
of Yearning comes from

872
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:53,400
antici it's not easy having a good time

873
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:56,200
the sweetness of Yearning comes from

874
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:59,040
anticipation it's the hope that just

875
00:37:56,200 --> 00:38:01,400
maybe you might finally grasp the thing

876
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:03,560
you're reaching for this time there's a

877
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:06,680
German word for this because of course

878
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:09,280
for frea which means preasure the

879
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:12,280
pleasure of anticipation is the reason

880
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:14,319
that we gift wrap presents as Ted Bundy

881
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:16,400
said the fantasy that accompanies and

882
00:38:14,319 --> 00:38:18,800
generates the anticipation that precedes

883
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:20,760
the crime is always more stimulating

884
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:24,400
than the immediate aftermath of the

885
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:26,800
crime itself so true anticipation is the

886
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:28,440
basic pleasure of eroticism and I do

887
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:31,000
think that if you skip right ahead to

888
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:32,839
sex in a story you're missing out on a

889
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:35,280
lot of really exciting things the first

890
00:38:32,839 --> 00:38:37,160
time you hold somebody's hand your heart

891
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:38,400
just goes crazy it's this amazing

892
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:40,560
experience you go home and tell your

893
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:43,160
friends about oh my gosh he touched my

894
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:47,079
hand you know a strip teas is infinitely

895
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:49,640
more erotic than a nudist colony why

896
00:38:47,079 --> 00:38:51,960
anticipation tension and release the

897
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:54,160
point of strip teas is that the audience

898
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:56,440
wants to see a naked woman but once the

899
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:59,599
woman is naked once the barrier is

900
00:38:56,440 --> 00:39:02,200
removed the show is over Stripes is like

901
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:04,640
the visual equivalent of a slow build

902
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:07,680
romance novel aren't mystery stories

903
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:10,400
like this too are Mysteries erotic the

904
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:12,359
pleasure is in unraveling the mystery

905
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:14,720
the yearning for the truth the

906
00:39:12,359 --> 00:39:17,400
anticipation of the answer once the

907
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:19,040
puzzle is solved you lose interest this

908
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:21,599
is how people become conspiracy

909
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:24,520
theorists they get addicted to that Rush

910
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:26,800
of Discovery going down the rabbit hole

911
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:28,960
is the pursuit of Truth rather than the

912
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:31,520
possession of it a better outlet for

913
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:34,119
this urge is philosophy philosophy is

914
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:36,359
inherently erotic in that philosophical

915
00:39:34,119 --> 00:39:38,800
questions by Nature can never be

916
00:39:36,359 --> 00:39:41,760
definitively answered so the epistemic

917
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:44,240
yearning never ends in The Importance of

918
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:46,000
Being Earnest algae says the very

919
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:48,079
essence of romance is uncertainty

920
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,920
uncertainty is also the very essence of

921
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:53,560
gambling it's why I wasted $2,000

922
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:56,240
playing Egypt Quest gambling is

923
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:59,200
addictive because the for frea the

924
00:39:56,240 --> 00:40:01,560
anticipation of maybe win is more

925
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:02,920
compelling than the win itself very

926
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:04,160
romantic to be in love but there's

927
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:06,280
nothing romantic about a definite

928
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:07,920
proposal one may be accepted one usually

929
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:10,319
is I believe then the whole excitement

930
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:13,280
is over uncertainty sustains the

931
00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:15,040
Bittersweet mix of Hope and anxiety

932
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:17,400
which is ruinous when it leads to the

933
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:20,200
junky behavior of gambling addicts and

934
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:23,040
serial adultery but which I think can be

935
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:25,640
safely simulated in art consider

936
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:28,280
Twilight to choose a random example will

937
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:29,800
this romance end in love or murder it

938
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:32,240
doesn't matter if you know it will end

939
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:34,880
with a happily ever after it's about the

940
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:37,880
process how you get there consider the

941
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:40,640
music of my youth Mozart this Symphony

942
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:44,599
number 25 in G minor guess what chord it

943
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:47,520
ends on spoiler alert G minor people

944
00:40:44,599 --> 00:40:50,440
think Mozart is stuffy now but it's very

945
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:52,800
erotic music it's all about tension and

946
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:55,640
release Mozart builds tension through

947
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:58,160
devices like Rising Melody increased

948
00:40:55,640 --> 00:41:01,040
dissonance increased voice volume

949
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:03,560
rhythmic complexity harmonic wandering

950
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:06,160
from the tonic or simply adding more

951
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:10,319
notes too many notes the tension is

952
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:12,720
released in a chord sequence called a

953
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:15,359
Cadence music teachers always describe

954
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:17,480
the Cadence as returning home comparing

955
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:20,079
the musical narrative structure to a

956
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:22,520
hero's journey on its own the Cadence is

957
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:25,280
kind of boring so it's often drawn out

958
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:28,319
and ornamented with a

959
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:31,000
Trill what is the point of this gesture

960
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:32,550
well it heightens the tension just as

961
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:37,599
it's about to be

962
00:41:32,550 --> 00:41:37,599
[Music]

963
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:47,640
released the trill occurs at that pre

964
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:50,720
climactic moment when gratification is

965
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:53,119
imminent it's very sexual it's musical

966
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:55,480
edging when you hear it in isolation it

967
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:57,760
just sounds like an 18th century musical

968
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:59,960
stock phrase but that's exactly the

969
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:02,359
point I'm making the release is only

970
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:05,280
pleasurable because of the tension that

971
00:42:02,359 --> 00:42:07,920
is accumulated in anticipation of it

972
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:09,680
without the tension there is no release

973
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:12,960
and that's just kind of the nature of

974
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:16,160
human pleasure it's Fire and Ice here

975
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:18,440
doctor father says we are so constituted

976
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:20,559
that we can only intensely enjoy

977
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:23,640
contrasts without the bitterness of

978
00:42:20,559 --> 00:42:25,720
tension there is no sweetness of release

979
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:27,640
philosophies that seek to liberate us

980
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:30,839
from suffering ad

981
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:33,040
that we let go of Desire stoicism says

982
00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:35,520
we should limit desire to things we can

983
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:38,359
control Buddhism says we can stop

984
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:41,079
craving and clinging by recognizing that

985
00:42:38,359 --> 00:42:43,640
desire arises from impermanence and from

986
00:42:41,079 --> 00:42:46,559
the illusion of the self philosophers

987
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:48,680
and gurus are correct to recognize that

988
00:42:46,559 --> 00:42:51,640
desire leads to

989
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:54,280
suffering but Detachment From Desire is

990
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:57,200
not Bliss if someone is promising you

991
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:59,880
Bliss or some mystical solution to the

992
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:02,400
wound of human nature that's probably a

993
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:04,920
cult watch out for that Detachment

994
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:08,000
results in something more lowkey like

995
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:10,800
Tranquility or peace wise men are always

996
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:12,880
saying stop clinging to desire and

997
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:15,480
you'll find peace wise men are always

998
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:18,559
saying this the daed Jing chapter 46

999
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:22,160
says one who knows that enough is enough

1000
00:43:18,559 --> 00:43:25,040
will always have enough that is wisdom

1001
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:27,240
and wisdom is soothing but it's not

1002
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:29,640
exciting so it's really your choice to

1003
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:32,520
make do you want to read novels about

1004
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:34,599
wise people being at peace or do you

1005
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:37,400
choose violence do you choose the

1006
00:43:34,599 --> 00:43:40,079
world's most dangerous predator

1007
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:43,440
personally I think wisdom is best left

1008
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:46,319
to the wise couldn't be me I like things

1009
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:50,800
and stuff too much the wheel of samsara

1010
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:50,800
is very much my stomping ground

1011
00:43:51,640 --> 00:44:07,520
[Music]

1012
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:08,880
so in Maryland there's this place called

1013
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:14,559
Royal

1014
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:14,559
Farms it's like if a KFC was inside of a

1015
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,880
7-Eleven they're open all the time you

1016
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,720
get

1017
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:25,720
cigarettes chicken energy drinks you

1018
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:28,480
know human blood part three

1019
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:30,400
fantasy okay we need to talk about the

1020
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:32,559
sexual aspect I know YouTube is trying

1021
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:35,359
to be more family friendly and as a

1022
00:44:32,559 --> 00:44:37,240
friend of the family I respect that so I

1023
00:44:35,359 --> 00:44:39,400
might have to use some euphemisms some

1024
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:41,200
indirect Language by the time I'm done

1025
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:43,440
with them the family is going to be on

1026
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:45,079
their hands and knees begging for more

1027
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:47,440
many people have commented on the

1028
00:44:45,079 --> 00:44:50,079
unguarded blurting it all out quality of

1029
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:51,680
Twilight in one interview Robert patson

1030
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:54,280
said he thinks that Twilight is

1031
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:57,040
Stephanie Meyer's sexual fantasy I was

1032
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:58,760
convinced that Stephanie was con

1033
00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:02,240
convinced she was Bella and you're like

1034
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:03,880
reading her her sort of sexual fantasy

1035
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:05,839
about some and especially when she says

1036
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:08,119
it was based on a dream I think this is

1037
00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:09,920
another reason that people find Twilight

1038
00:45:08,119 --> 00:45:11,880
cringe Stephanie Meyer is taking

1039
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:14,240
dictation directly from the inner

1040
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:15,839
goddess and it's very honest it's really

1041
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:17,359
really honest and that's kind of what's

1042
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:19,160
weird about it I love that about

1043
00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:21,280
Twilight it's like reading someone's

1044
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:23,079
diary now I realize here I'm stepping

1045
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:24,880
into a vicious debate that's been going

1046
00:45:23,079 --> 00:45:27,480
on for decades about the difference

1047
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:29,480
between romance and erotica what is the

1048
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:31,200
difference between romance and erotica I

1049
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:32,800
got so curious about this that I

1050
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:35,359
actually contacted the English

1051
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:37,079
departments of Harvard Yale and Stanford

1052
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:39,559
and I was surprised that they pretty

1053
00:45:37,079 --> 00:45:43,160
much all agreed on a definition that

1054
00:45:39,559 --> 00:45:45,680
romance is for good girls and erotica is

1055
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:48,920
for slots pornography of course is for

1056
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:51,200
men there's a buck wild debate from 1987

1057
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:53,280
between romance Titans Jackie Collins

1058
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:55,520
and Barbara Cartland who between them

1059
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:57,920
sold more than a billion books the

1060
00:45:55,520 --> 00:46:00,559
debate gets well you kind of just have

1061
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:04,599
to see it to believe it it's evil really

1062
00:46:00,559 --> 00:46:06,920
Weck the books that you write quite

1063
00:46:04,599 --> 00:46:10,079
frankly Barbara Cartland says that

1064
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:12,040
Jackie Collins books are evil why

1065
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:13,000
because they have sex scenes well I

1066
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:14,599
really don't think there's anything

1067
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,880
disgusting about naked people rolling

1068
00:46:14,599 --> 00:46:17,680
around on beds I thought that's what

1069
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:19,880
you're supposed to do when you're

1070
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:22,440
married how do you know and according to

1071
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:25,040
Cartland women's fiction shouldn't have

1072
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:27,520
sex scenes because a think of the

1073
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:29,760
children have you ever thought it has on

1074
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:31,960
young people yes they love it and they

1075
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:34,119
WR I was reading it under two is helping

1076
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:37,079
the perverts don't you think it has

1077
00:46:34,119 --> 00:46:38,440
helped the purpose it has and D

1078
00:46:37,079 --> 00:46:41,359
according to Cartland we should

1079
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:44,000
encourage Purity for women that is

1080
00:46:41,359 --> 00:46:45,400
asexuality you know I believe in Purity

1081
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,680
for women and this is the thing I've

1082
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:50,520
been fighting for it's a classic good

1083
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:53,079
girls versus debate all this awful

1084
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:54,640
abusive children all that comes from

1085
00:46:53,079 --> 00:46:56,920
permissive s there's something so

1086
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:59,440
surreal about what I can only describe

1087
00:46:56,920 --> 00:47:01,800
as an 80-year-old woman in clown drag

1088
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:03,559
lecturing everyone about sexual Purity

1089
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:05,680
like what is this the British aren't

1090
00:47:03,559 --> 00:47:07,880
coming the British aren't coming Carland

1091
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:11,359
endorses the Victorian Viewpoint that

1092
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:12,720
women ladies are asexual you were a lady

1093
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:14,599
you were dressed in China you were

1094
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:16,640
something perfect slightly sacred this

1095
00:47:14,599 --> 00:47:19,079
is a view taken by 19th century

1096
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:21,640
sexologist Richard Fon craft ebbing

1097
00:47:19,079 --> 00:47:23,400
author of psychopathia sexualis one of

1098
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:26,040
the first attempts to scientifically

1099
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:27,640
study human sexuality So Scandalous at

1100
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:30,400
the time of publication that it had to

1101
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:33,240
be printed in Latin to keep the Hoy pooy

1102
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:35,079
from getting Notions quote woman if

1103
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:37,800
physically and mentally normal and

1104
00:47:35,079 --> 00:47:40,040
properly educated has but little sensual

1105
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:42,559
desire this is an absurd claim on its

1106
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:45,200
face if women instinctually have but

1107
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:47,160
little sensual desire then why is that

1108
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:49,480
contingent on their being properly

1109
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:51,800
educated the answer is basically that

1110
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:54,599
for victorians the Madonna

1111
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:56,280
dichotomy was an ontological distinction

1112
00:47:54,599 --> 00:47:59,119
there was an enormous gap between the

1113
00:47:56,280 --> 00:48:00,559
lady and The Prostitute and no young man

1114
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:01,839
who took me out would ever have thought

1115
00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:03,640
of asking me to go to bed with him they

1116
00:48:01,839 --> 00:48:05,200
asked me to marry him it was understood

1117
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:07,319
that there were really two very

1118
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:09,839
different kinds of women there were real

1119
00:48:07,319 --> 00:48:12,079
women ladies who were by definition

1120
00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:14,839
asexual and then there was this other

1121
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:17,040
category of person prostitutes or Fallen

1122
00:48:14,839 --> 00:48:20,079
women who were technically female but

1123
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:22,400
who were seen as degraded ruined beings

1124
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:26,200
with desire equal to if not exceeding

1125
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:29,119
that of men strumpets trollops slous

1126
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:31,520
 ladies were seen as delicate and

1127
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:33,280
innocent sacred Treasures to be

1128
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:34,800
protected you were a lady you were

1129
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:36,520
dressed in China you were something

1130
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:38,680
perfect slightly sacred and there's a

1131
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:40,880
kind of privilege that came with that

1132
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:42,760
but at the cost of sexuality and I

1133
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:45,000
believed it for years I thought that

1134
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:47,680
ladies didn't feel P feel passion and

1135
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:49,520
prostitutes did Lady status has often

1136
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:51,720
only been available to middle and upper

1137
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:54,119
class white women with prostitutes and

1138
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:56,799
Fallen women relegated to this other

1139
00:48:54,119 --> 00:48:59,400
category that was seen as sexual but

1140
00:48:56,799 --> 00:49:01,760
degraded the idea that Purity is the

1141
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:03,839
natural state of women is actually

1142
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:06,000
fairly recent ancient and medieval

1143
00:49:03,839 --> 00:49:08,680
Europeans had almost the opposite view

1144
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:11,040
of the victorians often seeing women as

1145
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:13,040
more sexual than men according to the

1146
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:15,520
most widely read Encyclopedia of the

1147
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:17,640
Middle Ages quote the word femina comes

1148
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:20,359
from the Greek derived from the force of

1149
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:22,760
fire because her concupiscence is very

1150
00:49:20,359 --> 00:49:25,400
passionate women are more libidinous

1151
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:27,680
than men in an ancient Greek myth Zeus

1152
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:30,480
and Hera are feuding about whether men

1153
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:32,839
or women enjoy sex more so they summon

1154
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:35,599
the transsexual Prophet tyresius to

1155
00:49:32,839 --> 00:49:38,240
resolve the issue and tyresius says of

1156
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:41,240
10 parts a man enjoys one only but a

1157
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:43,960
woman enjoys the full 10 parts which sex

1158
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:46,400
is more sexual controversial looking

1159
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:49,000
into it in our own time the Victorian

1160
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:52,240
idea that the right kind of women have

1161
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:55,160
but little sensual desire still persists

1162
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:59,160
in stereotypes about female sexuality

1163
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:59,160
being limited to delicate hand

1164
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:04,280
grazing in

1165
00:50:01,319 --> 00:50:06,599
1973 permissive Cosmopolitan magazine

1166
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:09,000
ran an article by a male psychiatrist

1167
00:50:06,599 --> 00:50:12,119
who announced women do not have sexual

1168
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:14,799
fantasies how do we know ask a woman and

1169
00:50:12,119 --> 00:50:17,319
she will usually reply no good work

1170
00:50:14,799 --> 00:50:19,280
doctor incredible research methods this

1171
00:50:17,319 --> 00:50:22,200
kind of statement is a self-fulfilling

1172
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:25,040
prophecy when the experts announced that

1173
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:27,160
women do not have sexual fantasies women

1174
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:29,599
whose experience tells them other wise

1175
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:31,960
feel deviant and abnormal which makes

1176
00:50:29,599 --> 00:50:34,319
them reluctant to speak up seemingly

1177
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:36,960
descriptive statements about sexuality

1178
00:50:34,319 --> 00:50:38,960
like women do not have sexual fantasies

1179
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:41,119
often serve to enforce the very

1180
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:43,799
situation they claim to describe the

1181
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:45,680
Cartland Collins debate was echoed 25

1182
00:50:43,799 --> 00:50:48,359
years later in debates about Twilight

1183
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:51,839
and 50 Shades of Gray with 50 Shades

1184
00:50:48,359 --> 00:50:57,400
widely condemned as mommy porn which

1185
00:50:51,839 --> 00:50:59,240
come on people let moms have pornography

1186
00:50:57,400 --> 00:51:01,160
it's like once a decade Society

1187
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:03,520
collectively discovers that women's

1188
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:06,040
sexuality exists and everyone loses

1189
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:08,720
their minds Stephany Meyer like Barbara

1190
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:10,839
Cartland is something of a Neo Victorian

1191
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:12,680
or at least a Neo Edwardian boo

1192
00:51:10,839 --> 00:51:14,799
Stephanie is not as moralizing as

1193
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:17,079
Barbara Cartland but she has said for

1194
00:51:14,799 --> 00:51:19,119
example erotica is not something I read

1195
00:51:17,079 --> 00:51:21,359
I don't even read traditional romance

1196
00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:23,640
why not it's too smutty there's a reason

1197
00:51:21,359 --> 00:51:26,079
my books have a lot of Innocence that's

1198
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:27,960
the sort of world I live in well I

1199
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:29,680
support what Stephanie Meyer has to tell

1200
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:31,400
herself to sleep at night I don't know

1201
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:33,680
that I would describe Twilight as a

1202
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:35,640
world of Innocence I've killed people

1203
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:37,520
before I like watching you sleep it's

1204
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:42,559
hard to say with all those clothes on

1205
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:42,559
stranger things happen every day trust

1206
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:48,280
me but it's true that there are no sex

1207
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:50,079
scenes it's strictly PG-13 in one scene

1208
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:52,640
Bella is too embarrassed to look at

1209
00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:55,040
lingerie because it's too sexy even when

1210
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:57,000
it isn't on in an now Infamous scene

1211
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:59,799
Bella walks down the stairs and a long

1212
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:02,799
khaki skirt and blue blouse which outfit

1213
00:51:59,799 --> 00:52:04,559
Edward describes as utterly indecent no

1214
00:52:02,799 --> 00:52:07,440
one should look so tempting it's not

1215
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:08,880
fair so what did Robert patson mean when

1216
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:10,839
he said that Twilight is Stephanie

1217
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:14,480
Meyer's sexual fantasy you're like

1218
00:52:10,839 --> 00:52:18,119
reading her her sort of sexual fantasy a

1219
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:19,799
story can be sexy without sex scenes how

1220
00:52:18,119 --> 00:52:23,119
well I feel like this is something that

1221
00:52:19,799 --> 00:52:25,760
I should show and not tell for example

1222
00:52:23,119 --> 00:52:27,119
can we talk about the tent scene

1223
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:29,920
why is no one talking talking about the

1224
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:32,200
cuck tent scene in Twilight Episode 3

1225
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:34,000
Eclipse Bella and her polycule of

1226
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:36,520
monster men are taking the ring to

1227
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:38,680
Mordor when a winter storm rolls in

1228
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:40,559
Bella is in the tent and she's shivering

1229
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:43,079
her innocent little butt off and

1230
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:45,599
Edward's upset because vampires have no

1231
00:52:43,079 --> 00:52:48,040
body heat so he can't warm her up but

1232
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:50,119
Jacob is right outside and Jacob is a

1233
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:55,319
toasty dog boy with a canonical body

1234
00:52:50,119 --> 00:52:57,839
temperature of 108.9 De F let's face it

1235
00:52:55,319 --> 00:53:00,280
I am hotter than you so Edward agrees to

1236
00:52:57,839 --> 00:53:02,680
let the sexy shirtless Jacob share a

1237
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:05,280
sleeping bag with Bella to prevent her

1238
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:07,760
imminent death by freezing you'll warm

1239
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:10,960
up soon faster if you took your clothes

1240
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:13,559
off Jacob clutches Bella against his hot

1241
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:15,880
naked chest while Edward gazes on in

1242
00:53:13,559 --> 00:53:18,280
jealous Agony Bella is nestled in

1243
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:20,119
Jacob's arms pretending to be asleep

1244
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:22,559
while the two gorgeous monster men are

1245
00:53:20,119 --> 00:53:24,440
incandescent with desire for her they

1246
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:26,760
argue through the night about who loves

1247
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:29,720
her more and who can take better care of

1248
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:31,839
her and remember Edward can read minds

1249
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:34,280
so he's experiencing all of Jacob's

1250
00:53:31,839 --> 00:53:36,720
perverted fantasies in excruciating

1251
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:40,040
detail can you at least attempt to

1252
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:43,119
control your thoughts so why does this

1253
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:44,960
scene happen wherefore art the tent

1254
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:47,440
this is not a trick question the answer

1255
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:49,760
is very obvious the tent happens

1256
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:51,680
because Stephanie Meyer thinks it's hot

1257
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:53,880
because it is hot and maybe Stephanie

1258
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:56,160
would deny that she has any such impure

1259
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:58,880
feelings since she lives in a world of

1260
00:53:56,160 --> 00:54:01,040
innoc Ence but let's use common sense

1261
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:02,400
this is a sexual fantasy almost

1262
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:05,040
everything that went into Twilight was

1263
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:07,319
unconscious a lot of women like to feel

1264
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:09,480
intensely desired it's why a common

1265
00:54:07,319 --> 00:54:11,839
feminine fantasy is being at the center

1266
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:15,160
of attention from multiple men because

1267
00:54:11,839 --> 00:54:16,880
more men symbolizes more desire it's why

1268
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:19,160
you get romance novels like two

1269
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:22,079
billionaires in Vegas three boss's

1270
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:24,920
assistant four ranchers bride five Mafia

1271
00:54:22,079 --> 00:54:27,240
captors virgin six single dads Nanny

1272
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:30,240
seven groomsmen from hell eight brothers

1273
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:33,799
fiance nine Marines shared property 10

1274
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:35,640
Mountain men's baby and weing Heights

1275
00:54:33,799 --> 00:54:37,920
it's a really straightforward example of

1276
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:40,040
what is called wish fulfillment and

1277
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:42,040
Twilight has a lot of wish fulfillment

1278
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:43,880
you know Bella moves to a new school and

1279
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:46,640
even though she's an awkward tomboy who

1280
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:48,599
drives a rusty pickup truck every boy in

1281
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:50,400
school has a crush on her it's like

1282
00:54:48,599 --> 00:54:53,280
first grade all over again you're the

1283
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:55,440
shiny new toy two gorgeous monster boys

1284
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:57,559
fight over Bella and they carry her

1285
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:59,680
around and they tell her how much they

1286
00:54:57,559 --> 00:55:01,720
love her and want to protect her all the

1287
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:05,280
other girls are jealous of my cool

1288
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:07,640
boyfriend so by association I must be

1289
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:09,680
cool too if you're a Twilight reader and

1290
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:12,079
you identify with Bella these are

1291
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:15,680
exciting fantasies to have because they

1292
00:55:12,079 --> 00:55:18,440
gratify what Dr father calls his majesty

1293
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:20,760
the ego the hero of everyday dream and

1294
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:22,640
every story all of this I think is

1295
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:24,680
pretty obvious but where things get

1296
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:26,480
controversial and to many people

1297
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:28,839
disturbing is when you start start

1298
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:31,280
introducing darker themes into your

1299
00:55:28,839 --> 00:55:33,359
romantic wish fulfillment fantasies

1300
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:35,160
Edward stalking I like watching you

1301
00:55:33,359 --> 00:55:37,359
sleep the fact that he's self-

1302
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:39,079
admittedly a dangerous predator I'm the

1303
00:55:37,359 --> 00:55:41,280
world's most dangerous predat his

1304
00:55:39,079 --> 00:55:43,440
struggle with a vampiric desire to kill

1305
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:45,480
Bella and drink her blood people see

1306
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:47,559
this stuff and they think oh my God this

1307
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:50,760
is masochistic it's internalized

1308
00:55:47,559 --> 00:55:53,119
misogyny it's abusive it's pathological

1309
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:54,599
but I think that those concerns while

1310
00:55:53,119 --> 00:55:57,640
understandable come from a

1311
00:55:54,599 --> 00:55:59,839
misunderstanding of how fantasy Works

1312
00:55:57,640 --> 00:56:02,599
consider for example the ultimate

1313
00:55:59,839 --> 00:56:04,039
problematic fantasy the fantasy of

1314
00:56:02,599 --> 00:56:06,720
non-consent what we could

1315
00:56:04,039 --> 00:56:08,680
euphemistically call a ravishment

1316
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:11,039
fantasy this fantasy of being

1317
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:13,480
overpowered or in bondage or

1318
00:56:11,039 --> 00:56:15,559
surrendering to a dominant lover it's a

1319
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:16,960
very common fantasy for a lot of women

1320
00:56:15,559 --> 00:56:19,079
and also a lot of people who aren't

1321
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:20,720
women it's the reason bodice rippers are

1322
00:56:19,079 --> 00:56:23,280
called bodice rippers they were

1323
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:26,839
notorious for these ravishment scenes

1324
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:28,720
where bodices are you know

1325
00:56:26,839 --> 00:56:31,400
and this can be difficult to talk about

1326
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:33,280
because you know we worry that the worst

1327
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:36,400
men in the universe will take these

1328
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:39,280
fantasies as proof that women really

1329
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:41,880
want to be dominated by Violent Men but

1330
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:44,400
abusive men will use any pretext to

1331
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:47,480
justify their behavior and that's not on

1332
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:50,280
us it's on them so let's talk about it

1333
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:52,280
in 1973 the same year that Cosmo

1334
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:54,319
announced women don't have sexual

1335
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:57,079
fantasies the author Nancy Friday

1336
00:56:54,319 --> 00:56:59,520
published a book called my secret Garden

1337
00:56:57,079 --> 00:57:01,960
women's sexual fantasies Nancy Friday

1338
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:03,960
was a heroine of the sexual Revolution

1339
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:05,640
and I think it was Brave of her to

1340
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:09,000
publish this book despite its

1341
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:11,200
misleadingly twe cover and blurb dare to

1342
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:14,119
discover the beautiful blossoms the

1343
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:16,640
winding paths and the hidden Nooks of

1344
00:57:14,119 --> 00:57:18,960
female sexuality I hate that even the

1345
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:21,440
cover of a pervert book like this

1346
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:23,640
assumes that female sexuality is as

1347
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:25,160
mysterious as it is floral

1348
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:27,119
groundbreaking but there's nothing

1349
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:29,200
floral about the contents of Nancy

1350
00:57:27,119 --> 00:57:31,920
Friday's books which are essentially

1351
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:34,160
anthologies of fantasies submitted in

1352
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:36,680
response to a newspaper ad Nancy

1353
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:39,839
published that said female sexual

1354
00:57:36,680 --> 00:57:43,079
fantasies wanted by serious female

1355
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:45,039
researcher anonymity guaranteed love

1356
00:57:43,079 --> 00:57:47,599
that this resulted in a book which is

1357
00:57:45,039 --> 00:57:49,960
very explicit and which challenges

1358
00:57:47,599 --> 00:57:53,079
assumptions about feminine sexuality

1359
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:55,319
being sort of soft and gentle and mushy

1360
00:57:53,079 --> 00:57:58,359
the single greatest theme that emerged

1361
00:57:55,319 --> 00:58:01,799
was that of weak women being sexually

1362
00:57:58,359 --> 00:58:04,480
dominated forced by male strength to do

1363
00:58:01,799 --> 00:58:07,640
this deliciously awful thing so the

1364
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:08,640
ravishment fantasy proved to be the most

1365
00:58:07,640 --> 00:58:11,839
common

1366
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:14,079
fantasy why are these women all horribly

1367
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:16,960
traumatized is this internalized

1368
00:58:14,079 --> 00:58:19,200
misogyny well maybe but there's other

1369
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:21,920
explanations to consider you know women

1370
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:25,680
are kind of socialized not to display

1371
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:28,200
sexuality openly not to initiate being a

1372
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:32,240
proper feminine woman is supposed to

1373
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:35,240
involve being passive and modest or else

1374
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:38,280
women risk being recast from Madonna to

1375
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:41,079
 good girl to and being

1376
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:43,079
victimized and degraded as a result so

1377
00:58:41,079 --> 00:58:45,440
it makes sense that a lot of women might

1378
00:58:43,079 --> 00:58:48,799
be very protective of their innocent

1379
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:52,039
good girl self-image even in fantasy the

1380
00:58:48,799 --> 00:58:54,960
non-consent fantasy is a device that

1381
00:58:52,039 --> 00:58:58,039
absolves the woman from blame if she's

1382
00:58:54,960 --> 00:59:01,160
being forced then it's not her fault

1383
00:58:58,039 --> 00:59:04,359
ravishment is a ruse as Nancy Friday

1384
00:59:01,160 --> 00:59:06,839
says quote a deas exmachina we roll into

1385
00:59:04,359 --> 00:59:09,440
to catapult us past a lifetime of

1386
00:59:06,839 --> 00:59:11,680
women's rules against sex the women whom

1387
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:14,680
I've interviewed don't really want to be

1388
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:17,160
hurt or humiliated his male presence

1389
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:19,920
that effective battering ram neatly

1390
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:22,039
makes her relax sufficiently to enjoy

1391
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:25,400
and then allows her to return to Earth

1392
00:59:22,039 --> 00:59:27,880
her nice girl good daughter self- intact

1393
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:30,559
so the non consent fantasy is not wish

1394
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:33,200
fulfillment in a literal sense but in an

1395
00:59:30,559 --> 00:59:35,880
emotional sense like if a teenage boy

1396
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:38,319
fantasizes about dying gloriously in

1397
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:41,000
battle is that a masochistic fantasy

1398
00:59:38,319 --> 00:59:44,400
about death or is it an egotistical

1399
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:46,880
fantasy about Glory probably the latter

1400
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:49,440
likewise women who fantasize about being

1401
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:52,039
ravished do not actually want to be

1402
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:54,400
assaulted in a fantasy which is a

1403
00:59:52,039 --> 00:59:57,599
fictional scenario where you are in

1404
00:59:54,400 --> 01:00:00,160
control the non sense situation

1405
00:59:57,599 --> 01:00:02,599
satisfies your emotional needs to

1406
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:05,400
gratify desire without the burden of

1407
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:07,720
Shame and guilt and anxiety that comes

1408
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:11,119
with taking responsibility for your

1409
01:00:07,720 --> 01:00:13,599
desire another vampire novelist an rice

1410
01:00:11,119 --> 01:00:15,880
said of her own pom masochistic erotica

1411
01:00:13,599 --> 01:00:19,119
series The Books aren't about literal

1412
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:21,680
cruelty they're about surrender the fun

1413
01:00:19,119 --> 01:00:24,640
of imagining you have no choice but to

1414
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:27,280
enjoy sex the essential point is this

1415
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:30,039
fantasies are not literal wishes

1416
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:32,839
fantasies construct situations where

1417
01:00:30,039 --> 01:00:35,960
emotional needs are met and inhibitions

1418
01:00:32,839 --> 01:00:38,200
to pleasure are removed so for example

1419
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:41,319
in a fantasy where the dangerous alpha

1420
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:44,680
male is the aggressor the woman remains

1421
01:00:41,319 --> 01:00:47,240
innocent the bad boy is bad so that the

1422
01:00:44,680 --> 01:00:49,760
good girl gets to stay good we could

1423
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:52,079
call this disavowal the process of

1424
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:54,640
constructing fantasy situations where

1425
01:00:52,079 --> 01:00:56,559
your desires are gratified without

1426
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:59,200
having to assert or even having to

1427
01:00:56,559 --> 01:01:02,200
acknowledge the desire non-consent

1428
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:04,599
fantasies are one ruse of disavowal but

1429
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:07,000
fantasy is infinitely creative in

1430
01:01:04,599 --> 01:01:09,440
constructing these devices remember the

1431
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:11,559
 tent Bella is a good girl who would

1432
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:14,400
never consider having a threesome but

1433
01:01:11,559 --> 01:01:16,400
it's dangerously cold I guess we have no

1434
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:19,160
choice but to huddle for warmth

1435
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:21,520
disavowal me and Draco got detention in

1436
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:23,799
the Forbidden Forest and we had to camp

1437
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:26,880
out for the night but there was only one

1438
01:01:23,799 --> 01:01:29,079
sleeping bag guess we have to share it

1439
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:31,599
there's a million fanfiction and erotica

1440
01:01:29,079 --> 01:01:34,640
tropes that are basically variations on

1441
01:01:31,599 --> 01:01:38,359
this ruse of disavowal for example sex

1442
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:42,280
pollen aliens made them do it hypnosis

1443
01:01:38,359 --> 01:01:46,079
mind control non-consent dubious consent

1444
01:01:42,280 --> 01:01:48,839
mat or die Pon far forced feminization

1445
01:01:46,079 --> 01:01:51,480
Hermione is an Omega in heat and Draco

1446
01:01:48,839 --> 01:01:53,599
is the only nearby Alpha the continued

1447
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:56,920
popularity of these tropes demonstrates

1448
01:01:53,599 --> 01:01:59,720
to me that erotic disavow fantasies are

1449
01:01:56,920 --> 01:02:02,359
not just a relic of a past age of bodice

1450
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:04,319
Rippers and sexual conservatism I don't

1451
01:02:02,359 --> 01:02:06,799
think that women today are much more

1452
01:02:04,319 --> 01:02:08,880
liberated than Nancy Friday and Anne

1453
01:02:06,799 --> 01:02:11,000
Rice like where are these liberated

1454
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:13,880
women maybe in Europe look I don't know

1455
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:16,200
what goes on over there in peros slavia

1456
01:02:13,880 --> 01:02:18,960
but here in America we still believe in

1457
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:20,680
a little thing called sexual repression

1458
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:23,880
like if you look through fanfiction

1459
01:02:20,680 --> 01:02:26,440
platforms like watpad and A3 that host

1460
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:28,960
erotica mostly by women submissive

1461
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:31,799
fantasies are still pretty standard my

1462
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:34,640
mom sold my virginity to One Direction I

1463
01:02:31,799 --> 01:02:37,480
also see disavow at work in the infamous

1464
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:39,720
rescue fantasies in Twilight Bella is

1465
01:02:37,480 --> 01:02:42,119
walking the street alone at night when

1466
01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:44,319
she's menaced by a gang of thugs

1467
01:02:42,119 --> 01:02:46,760
apparently ready for a bit of the old

1468
01:02:44,319 --> 01:02:49,599
Ultraviolence but at the last minute

1469
01:02:46,760 --> 01:02:52,240
Edward sweeps in in his battle Volvo and

1470
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:55,839
saves the damel likewise at the end of

1471
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:58,520
the first movie there's a um a snuff f

1472
01:02:55,839 --> 01:03:00,640
film scene where the evil vampire James

1473
01:02:58,520 --> 01:03:02,400
intends to suck Bella's blood and make

1474
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:05,160
some kind of smut film out of it to

1475
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:07,359
torture Edward with this very eroticized

1476
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:10,079
violence is interrupted at the last

1477
01:03:07,359 --> 01:03:12,920
moment when Edward replaces the asent

1478
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:14,960
and Bella is rescued instead of ravished

1479
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:18,079
you try to suck the venom out no I won't

1480
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:18,079
be able to stop find the

1481
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:23,359
wheel I see this as a kind of double

1482
01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:25,240
disavowal it's a non-consent fantasy

1483
01:03:23,359 --> 01:03:28,359
that's transformed into something more

1484
01:03:25,240 --> 01:03:31,400
morally acceptable a rescue fantasy

1485
01:03:28,359 --> 01:03:33,960
rescued damils are a common erotic myth

1486
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:36,839
in the story of Perseus and Andromeda

1487
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:39,319
Andromeda is a naked woman in bondage

1488
01:03:36,839 --> 01:03:42,200
threatened by a monster but saved at the

1489
01:03:39,319 --> 01:03:44,559
last minute by pereus thrusting into the

1490
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:46,799
rescue with some kind of phallic weapon

1491
01:03:44,559 --> 01:03:49,839
in rescue fantasies the thrilling

1492
01:03:46,799 --> 01:03:52,160
possibility of sexual violence is raised

1493
01:03:49,839 --> 01:03:54,279
only to be disavowed at the last minute

1494
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:57,359
by the rescue but it's not just women

1495
01:03:54,279 --> 01:03:59,480
who disavow desire the rescue fantasy is

1496
01:03:57,359 --> 01:04:01,839
also appealing from the perspective of

1497
01:03:59,480 --> 01:04:05,480
pereus who gets to feel strong and

1498
01:04:01,839 --> 01:04:07,200
important and heroic while also you know

1499
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:08,279
getting to spend time around a naked

1500
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:11,400
woman in

1501
01:04:08,279 --> 01:04:14,079
Chains It's not even necessarily sexual

1502
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:17,240
desire that fantasy disavows in 50

1503
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:20,240
Shades of Gray Edward renamed Christian

1504
01:04:17,240 --> 01:04:22,880
is constantly issuing orderers to bellaa

1505
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:25,760
renamed Anastasia about what she should

1506
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:28,599
eat what car she should drive about what

1507
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:31,400
what gynecologist to see why is this

1508
01:04:28,599 --> 01:04:34,680
part of the fantasy well because making

1509
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:38,440
decisions is hard s said we're condemned

1510
01:04:34,680 --> 01:04:40,119
to be free why is freedom a condemnation

1511
01:04:38,440 --> 01:04:43,480
well because Freedom implies

1512
01:04:40,119 --> 01:04:46,000
responsibility and responsibility sucks

1513
01:04:43,480 --> 01:04:48,119
I for one hate being accountable for the

1514
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:50,319
consequences of my actions even

1515
01:04:48,119 --> 01:04:53,119
something as trivial as what should I

1516
01:04:50,319 --> 01:04:55,680
eat today is a decision fraught with

1517
01:04:53,119 --> 01:04:58,039
moral quandries and Body Image issues

1518
01:04:55,680 --> 01:05:00,359
isues and contradictory nutritional

1519
01:04:58,039 --> 01:05:02,319
advice coming at us from all angles

1520
01:05:00,359 --> 01:05:04,200
isn't there something relaxing about a

1521
01:05:02,319 --> 01:05:06,400
competent person just telling you what

1522
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:09,000
to do so you don't have to worry about

1523
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:10,839
it disavow is a useful ruse for

1524
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:13,440
indulging in all kinds of guilty

1525
01:05:10,839 --> 01:05:16,000
pleasures in 50 Shades Christian is

1526
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:18,880
constantly lavishing extravagant gifts

1527
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:21,400
on Anna he buys her a computer a car

1528
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:24,200
first class plane tickets and Anna

1529
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:26,799
constantly protests because she knows

1530
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:28,720
that it's goh to accept expensive gifts

1531
01:05:26,799 --> 01:05:31,119
from your billionaire boyfriend like

1532
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:34,240
some kind of kept woman but Christian

1533
01:05:31,119 --> 01:05:36,680
insists oh well I guess I have no choice

1534
01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:39,240
but to fly first class the function of

1535
01:05:36,680 --> 01:05:41,760
disavowal in Fantasy is that you get

1536
01:05:39,240 --> 01:05:44,240
what you want without the indignity of

1537
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:47,559
having to ask for it or even against

1538
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:50,039
your will in Twilight Bella hates

1539
01:05:47,559 --> 01:05:52,559
birthday parties and presents but

1540
01:05:50,039 --> 01:05:55,640
they're lavished on her anyway Edward's

1541
01:05:52,559 --> 01:05:58,039
fashionista sister Alice is always

1542
01:05:55,640 --> 01:06:01,480
feminizing Bella ordering her to wear

1543
01:05:58,039 --> 01:06:03,839
high heels and Bella's like no stop I

1544
01:06:01,480 --> 01:06:06,160
wear flannel and drive pickup trucks I'm

1545
01:06:03,839 --> 01:06:09,559
totally butch but clearly she's into

1546
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:11,440
this forested feminization this debing

1547
01:06:09,559 --> 01:06:14,680
Bella is adamant she doesn't want to

1548
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:16,680
fancy wedding but Alice insists so

1549
01:06:14,680 --> 01:06:18,440
there's a fancy wedding obviously

1550
01:06:16,680 --> 01:06:20,279
Stephanie wanted there to be a fancy

1551
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:22,640
wedding but you know what people say

1552
01:06:20,279 --> 01:06:26,400
about women who want fancy weddings

1553
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:28,960
Divas Bridezillas not a cute look so

1554
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:30,920
thanks to Alice Bella gets to have a

1555
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:33,559
fancy wedding without the indignity of

1556
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:35,160
having to want a fancy wedding now I

1557
01:06:33,559 --> 01:06:37,039
want to talk about one of the most

1558
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:40,599
controversial things that happens in

1559
01:06:37,039 --> 01:06:43,559
Twilight Jacob imprinting on reneesme

1560
01:06:40,599 --> 01:06:46,520
okay so I can't wait to explain this one

1561
01:06:43,559 --> 01:06:49,079
Stephanie introduces into werewolf lore

1562
01:06:46,520 --> 01:06:52,680
the notion of imprinting a kind of

1563
01:06:49,079 --> 01:06:55,000
lifelong liant fixation it's soulmates

1564
01:06:52,680 --> 01:06:58,200
basically in Breaking Dawn Bella gives

1565
01:06:55,000 --> 01:07:01,400
birth to a vampiric baby whom she names

1566
01:06:58,200 --> 01:07:04,240
reneesme yes it's very funny let's all

1567
01:07:01,400 --> 01:07:07,480
laugh to Bella essentially dies in

1568
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:11,160
childbirth and before she's resurrected

1569
01:07:07,480 --> 01:07:14,440
Jacob decides to murder reneesme the

1570
01:07:11,160 --> 01:07:17,400
baby as revenge for killing Bella but

1571
01:07:14,440 --> 01:07:20,960
when Jacob sees reneesme he imprints on

1572
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:23,520
her the baby essentially falling in love

1573
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:25,920
with this infant now I think this is

1574
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:28,160
amazing but everyone else seems seems to

1575
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:30,760
hate it you imprinted on my daughter it

1576
01:07:28,160 --> 01:07:33,480
wasn't my choice she's a baby why would

1577
01:07:30,760 --> 01:07:36,119
Stephanie write such a thing I think

1578
01:07:33,480 --> 01:07:38,880
Jacob imprints on reneesme because

1579
01:07:36,119 --> 01:07:41,960
Stephanie is unconsciously both Team

1580
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:43,960
Edward and Team Jacob almost everything

1581
01:07:41,960 --> 01:07:46,079
that went into Twilight was unconscious

1582
01:07:43,960 --> 01:07:47,880
I mean it's not that subtle you can love

1583
01:07:46,079 --> 01:07:50,240
more than one person at a time don't

1584
01:07:47,880 --> 01:07:53,520
make me choose but obviously Bella can't

1585
01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:55,760
be polyamorous because Stephanie's books

1586
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:58,319
have a lot of Innocence that's the sort

1587
01:07:55,760 --> 01:08:00,640
of world she lives in so imprinting on

1588
01:07:58,319 --> 01:08:03,599
reneesme allows Bella to secure

1589
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:07,480
monogamous ties to both Edward through

1590
01:08:03,599 --> 01:08:10,160
marriage and to Jacob vicariously

1591
01:08:07,480 --> 01:08:13,279
through her own daughter thus roping

1592
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:15,560
Jacob into this subtextually polyamorous

1593
01:08:13,279 --> 01:08:17,910
family we're all going to be together

1594
01:08:15,560 --> 01:08:19,319
now so should I start calling you

1595
01:08:17,910 --> 01:08:21,920
[Music]

1596
01:08:19,319 --> 01:08:24,440
Dad no I'm not saying you have to like

1597
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:26,920
it I'm just saying that's why this

1598
01:08:24,440 --> 01:08:29,040
happens probably so I've been arguing

1599
01:08:26,920 --> 01:08:31,239
that a lot of fantasies work by

1600
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:34,600
constructing situations where your

1601
01:08:31,239 --> 01:08:36,640
desires are both fulfilled and disavowed

1602
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:39,159
but there's more to it than just that if

1603
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:41,920
we consider the more problematic aspects

1604
01:08:39,159 --> 01:08:44,440
of Twilight Edward's stalking his

1605
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:47,520
violent urges the ravishment turned

1606
01:08:44,440 --> 01:08:49,880
rescue fantasies the appeal is not just

1607
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:53,080
that it absolves the Bella identified

1608
01:08:49,880 --> 01:08:55,600
reader of the responsibility and

1609
01:08:53,080 --> 01:08:57,920
stigma of sexuality there's also

1610
01:08:55,600 --> 01:09:01,159
something about the intensity and even

1611
01:08:57,920 --> 01:09:03,640
the violence of a fantasy Lover's desire

1612
01:09:01,159 --> 01:09:05,960
that is exciting there's a book by the

1613
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:08,400
psychoanalyst Michael Bader called

1614
01:09:05,960 --> 01:09:10,759
arousal the secret logic of sexual

1615
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:12,880
fantasies that I really enjoyed which

1616
01:09:10,759 --> 01:09:15,440
surprised me because I found it in the

1617
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:18,839
psychology section between why is my

1618
01:09:15,440 --> 01:09:20,920
marriage bad and help my teenager is a

1619
01:09:18,839 --> 01:09:23,839
piece of Bader's book takes a very

1620
01:09:20,920 --> 01:09:26,040
optimistic view of sexual fantasy quote

1621
01:09:23,839 --> 01:09:28,440
I do not think sexuality is driven by

1622
01:09:26,040 --> 01:09:30,679
kinky desires I think that it is driven

1623
01:09:28,440 --> 01:09:33,359
by straightforward desires for pleasure

1624
01:09:30,679 --> 01:09:35,359
and safety kinkiness is merely the

1625
01:09:33,359 --> 01:09:38,159
complicated route that some people need

1626
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:41,239
to take in order to safely feel pleasure

1627
01:09:38,159 --> 01:09:44,719
according to Bader fantasy is a tool for

1628
01:09:41,239 --> 01:09:47,000
overcoming guilt shame anxiety

1629
01:09:44,719 --> 01:09:49,520
responsibility and other obstacles to

1630
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:51,839
pleasure and arousal like Freud said the

1631
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:53,960
sexual Instinct has to struggle against

1632
01:09:51,839 --> 01:09:57,159
certain mental forces which act as

1633
01:09:53,960 --> 01:10:00,120
resistances dam upon sexual development

1634
01:09:57,159 --> 01:10:02,920
disgust shame and morality fantasy

1635
01:10:00,120 --> 01:10:05,560
functions to break through the dam to

1636
01:10:02,920 --> 01:10:07,800
rip the metaphorical bodice in the

1637
01:10:05,560 --> 01:10:10,840
Cinderella fantasy where a billionaire

1638
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:13,840
Falls for you an ordinary brunette the

1639
01:10:10,840 --> 01:10:16,600
attention of this powerful man functions

1640
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:19,159
as a proof of your worth of your

1641
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:22,040
desirability it's fundamentally a shame

1642
01:10:19,159 --> 01:10:25,320
negating fantasy it's satisfying because

1643
01:10:22,040 --> 01:10:29,760
most people have shame have insecurities

1644
01:10:25,320 --> 01:10:32,080
we feel too old too fat too trans too

1645
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:34,679
disabled it's always something right or

1646
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:36,600
maybe you were neglected as a child or

1647
01:10:34,679 --> 01:10:39,120
your sibling was always more beautiful

1648
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:41,719
and successful than you or you feel

1649
01:10:39,120 --> 01:10:43,679
underappreciated at work or your YouTube

1650
01:10:41,719 --> 01:10:45,880
videos don't get as many views as H

1651
01:10:43,679 --> 01:10:49,080
bomber guy whatever the source of the

1652
01:10:45,880 --> 01:10:51,880
insecurity this shame is a damn an

1653
01:10:49,080 --> 01:10:53,840
inhibition an obstacle to pleasure it's

1654
01:10:51,880 --> 01:10:56,120
hard to get excited when you feel

1655
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:59,159
inadequate unattracted active or

1656
01:10:56,120 --> 01:11:01,440
ordinary but in the eyes of this fantasy

1657
01:10:59,159 --> 01:11:04,360
billionaire or Vampire who's obsessed

1658
01:11:01,440 --> 01:11:07,000
with you you become extraordinary the

1659
01:11:04,360 --> 01:11:09,679
fantasy creates a situation where your

1660
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:11,880
insecurities are proven false or in

1661
01:11:09,679 --> 01:11:14,600
which your flaws turn out to be

1662
01:11:11,880 --> 01:11:17,159
desirable which negates the shame that

1663
01:11:14,600 --> 01:11:20,080
inhibits pleasure a feminist objection

1664
01:11:17,159 --> 01:11:22,840
to 50 Shades might go why does it have

1665
01:11:20,080 --> 01:11:25,760
to be a rich husband why can't women

1666
01:11:22,840 --> 01:11:26,960
fantasize about financial Independence

1667
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:29,120
well because that completely

1668
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:31,239
misunderstands the emotional logic of

1669
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:34,199
the fantasy it's not really about the

1670
01:11:31,239 --> 01:11:37,760
money money is just an efficient symbol

1671
01:11:34,199 --> 01:11:41,639
it signifies value worth in the logic of

1672
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:44,199
fantasy a rich man is a high value man

1673
01:11:41,639 --> 01:11:45,920
especially to us a vulgar Americans to

1674
01:11:44,199 --> 01:11:48,679
an Old-Fashioned English woman like

1675
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:51,280
Barbara Cartland the ideal romantic hero

1676
01:11:48,679 --> 01:11:54,199
is preferably a peer of the realm a

1677
01:11:51,280 --> 01:11:57,040
disgraceful Duke a wicked Marquee an

1678
01:11:54,199 --> 01:11:59,880
elusive Earl in desperate times we might

1679
01:11:57,040 --> 01:12:03,199
even settle for a cruel count when his

1680
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:05,960
lordship bestows upon you lavish gifts

1681
01:12:03,199 --> 01:12:08,520
despite your protests and disavowals the

1682
01:12:05,960 --> 01:12:10,800
gifts are proof that he desires you that

1683
01:12:08,520 --> 01:12:13,520
you are as enticing as any beautiful

1684
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:16,239
expensive object the wealth and gifts

1685
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:18,639
are of secondary importance first we

1686
01:12:16,239 --> 01:12:21,600
seek the refutation of our shame the

1687
01:12:18,639 --> 01:12:24,840
validation of our desirability and above

1688
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:27,199
all proof that we are loved often this

1689
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:30,280
type of fantasy involves a competitive

1690
01:12:27,199 --> 01:12:33,280
element too where Rivals usually other

1691
01:12:30,280 --> 01:12:35,880
women must be eliminated this is taken

1692
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:38,280
to embarrassing Extremes in 50 Shades of

1693
01:12:35,880 --> 01:12:40,840
Gray where Christian surrounds himself

1694
01:12:38,280 --> 01:12:43,920
with what Anna refers to as Immaculate

1695
01:12:40,840 --> 01:12:46,800
blondes and Stepford Wives young blonde

1696
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:49,040
women whom Christian employs precisely

1697
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:51,600
because he's not attracted to any of

1698
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:53,840
them Christian only being attracted to

1699
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:56,560
superficially ordinary and awkward

1700
01:12:53,840 --> 01:13:00,159
brunettes who remind him of and this is

1701
01:12:56,560 --> 01:13:02,480
a direct quotation the crack wh my birth

1702
01:13:00,159 --> 01:13:05,960
mother

1703
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:08,120
y Anna also has the satisfaction of

1704
01:13:05,960 --> 01:13:10,199
humiliating the attractive blonde

1705
01:13:08,120 --> 01:13:12,600
architect Christian hires to design

1706
01:13:10,199 --> 01:13:14,600
their house and at one point she throws

1707
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:17,760
a drink in the face of Christian's

1708
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:21,520
childhood seductress who yes is also

1709
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:24,080
blonde he's not capable of

1710
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:26,120
marriage in Twilight Bella is a

1711
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:28,440
superficially ordin AR and awkward

1712
01:13:26,120 --> 01:13:31,639
brunette who is frequently jealous of

1713
01:13:28,440 --> 01:13:34,400
Edward's blonde bombshell sister Rosalie

1714
01:13:31,639 --> 01:13:37,560
as well as the Denali Cen of vampires

1715
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:40,199
blonde vix andzel to whom we are assured

1716
01:13:37,560 --> 01:13:42,719
Edward feels not the slightest twinge of

1717
01:13:40,199 --> 01:13:45,520
Attraction my point is that this need

1718
01:13:42,719 --> 01:13:48,360
and fantasy to cancel out every other

1719
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:50,600
attractive woman has the same meaning

1720
01:13:48,360 --> 01:13:54,120
Anna Freud attributed to a female

1721
01:13:50,600 --> 01:13:55,800
patient's fantasy father loves only me

1722
01:13:54,120 --> 01:13:58,520
and the fact that the men in these

1723
01:13:55,800 --> 01:14:02,320
fantasies are often substitute father

1724
01:13:58,520 --> 01:14:06,280
figures is a fact so obvious that it

1725
01:14:02,320 --> 01:14:09,320
hardly warrants mentioning I know I look

1726
01:14:06,280 --> 01:14:11,679
hot feminine sexual fantasies are often

1727
01:14:09,320 --> 01:14:14,360
modeled on myths and fairy tales

1728
01:14:11,679 --> 01:14:17,159
Cinderella sleeping beauty Beauty and

1729
01:14:14,360 --> 01:14:20,400
the Beast Little Red Riding Hood Hades

1730
01:14:17,159 --> 01:14:23,080
and pany Adam and Eve pereus and

1731
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:25,639
Andromeda if Cinderella style fantasies

1732
01:14:23,080 --> 01:14:27,600
are usually about refuting shame I'd

1733
01:14:25,639 --> 01:14:30,080
argue that Beauty and the Beast style

1734
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:32,320
fantasies are usually about negating

1735
01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:35,320
guilt by Beauty and the Beast style

1736
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:39,040
fantasies I mean erotic fantasies where

1737
01:14:35,320 --> 01:14:42,440
the hero is a Mafia Boss a stalker a

1738
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:45,719
pirate an abusive employer a conduct

1739
01:14:42,440 --> 01:14:48,080
violating Professor a disgraceful Duke a

1740
01:14:45,719 --> 01:14:50,719
sadistic billionaire or for that matter

1741
01:14:48,080 --> 01:14:53,040
my own brother a godamn sucking

1742
01:14:50,719 --> 01:14:55,520
vampire my own brother a godamn

1743
01:14:53,040 --> 01:14:58,320
sucking vampire obviously in Twilight

1744
01:14:55,520 --> 01:15:01,719
as in a lot of romance fiction the hero

1745
01:14:58,320 --> 01:15:04,440
is both Prince Charming and the Beast a

1746
01:15:01,719 --> 01:15:08,800
Darcy with Heathcliff characteristics

1747
01:15:04,440 --> 01:15:08,800
what is the fantasy appeal of the

1748
01:15:09,639 --> 01:15:15,280
Beast why is he's so sexy well there's

1749
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:17,920
an element of selfishness inherent to

1750
01:15:15,280 --> 01:15:20,639
sexuality what Michael Bader calls

1751
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:22,880
ruthlessness quote sexual excitement

1752
01:15:20,639 --> 01:15:24,960
requires that we momentarily become

1753
01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:26,800
selfish and turn away from concern

1754
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:29,639
conerns about the other's pleasure in

1755
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:32,600
order to surrender to our own women in

1756
01:15:29,639 --> 01:15:35,360
particular often feel guilty about being

1757
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:38,080
selfish they're afraid they'll take too

1758
01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:40,199
long or that receiving pleasure is

1759
01:15:38,080 --> 01:15:42,679
one-sided maybe it's because women are

1760
01:15:40,199 --> 01:15:45,000
told to be caretakers to put other

1761
01:15:42,679 --> 01:15:47,360
people's needs before their own but in

1762
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:50,120
the fantasy where you've been tied up by

1763
01:15:47,360 --> 01:15:52,600
Christian Gray you have no say in the

1764
01:15:50,120 --> 01:15:55,120
matter you cannot be guilty because it's

1765
01:15:52,600 --> 01:15:57,600
not your fault and the selfishness of of

1766
01:15:55,120 --> 01:16:00,280
the Beast gives Beauty permission to be

1767
01:15:57,600 --> 01:16:02,760
selfish too to surrender to her own

1768
01:16:00,280 --> 01:16:05,040
pleasure Bader says quote sexual

1769
01:16:02,760 --> 01:16:08,320
fantasies always find a way of turning

1770
01:16:05,040 --> 01:16:10,679
the no of guilt into the yes of pleasure

1771
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:14,400
a similar guilt negation is achieved by

1772
01:16:10,679 --> 01:16:16,920
fantasies of anonymity a masked stranger

1773
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:19,400
someone you have no obligation to take

1774
01:16:16,920 --> 01:16:21,920
care of and because you're strangers to

1775
01:16:19,400 --> 01:16:23,960
each other you also have less reason to

1776
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:26,679
be ashamed it's why when you have an

1777
01:16:23,960 --> 01:16:30,040
orgy at your opulent Mansion you have to

1778
01:16:26,679 --> 01:16:33,199
make everyone wear a mask like anonymity

1779
01:16:30,040 --> 01:16:36,040
opulence is a defense against shame when

1780
01:16:33,199 --> 01:16:38,480
someone surrounds thems with opulence

1781
01:16:36,040 --> 01:16:41,400
what are they trying to say abouts the

1782
01:16:38,480 --> 01:16:44,800
subliminal message of opulence is I am

1783
01:16:41,400 --> 01:16:47,400
valuable I am desirable it's why so many

1784
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:50,880
romantic and erotic fantasies take place

1785
01:16:47,400 --> 01:16:53,440
in opulent settings now in reality the

1786
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:55,800
ruthlessness enabled by fantasy

1787
01:16:53,440 --> 01:16:59,120
eventually conflicts with our desire to

1788
01:16:55,800 --> 01:17:01,719
be loved a paradox of sexuality is that

1789
01:16:59,120 --> 01:17:04,159
ruthlessness must somehow be balanced

1790
01:17:01,719 --> 01:17:06,840
with tenderness if you only use and

1791
01:17:04,159 --> 01:17:09,360
objectify your partner there can be no

1792
01:17:06,840 --> 01:17:11,480
love but if you're overly anxious about

1793
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:14,760
your partner's needs to the exclusion of

1794
01:17:11,480 --> 01:17:17,679
your own the flame of Desire will go out

1795
01:17:14,760 --> 01:17:20,239
in sex there is such a thing as not

1796
01:17:17,679 --> 01:17:22,880
enough selfishness this is my theory

1797
01:17:20,239 --> 01:17:26,400
about the gentle Rogue he's appealing

1798
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:29,120
because he's both gentle and and a rogue

1799
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:32,320
I am very smart the gentle Rogue is a

1800
01:17:29,120 --> 01:17:35,239
sort of vegetarian vampire capable of

1801
01:17:32,320 --> 01:17:37,040
both ruthlessness and tenderness so from

1802
01:17:35,239 --> 01:17:40,360
the perspective of Nancy Friday and

1803
01:17:37,040 --> 01:17:42,840
Michael Bader sexual fantasies even ones

1804
01:17:40,360 --> 01:17:45,679
that seem violent and disturbing can be

1805
01:17:42,840 --> 01:17:47,880
understood as psychological devices that

1806
01:17:45,679 --> 01:17:50,520
lead us to pleasure through the

1807
01:17:47,880 --> 01:17:52,719
Labyrinth of guilt and shame I wish that

1808
01:17:50,520 --> 01:17:54,840
people who are inclined to Crusade

1809
01:17:52,719 --> 01:17:57,600
against dangerous books were abuse

1810
01:17:54,840 --> 01:18:00,679
abusive ships would try to think about

1811
01:17:57,600 --> 01:18:03,639
fantasy in a way that's less literal and

1812
01:18:00,679 --> 01:18:06,880
more psychological like do Furies and

1813
01:18:03,639 --> 01:18:09,920
Omega verse fic writers normalize

1814
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:12,880
beastiality no the fantasy of human

1815
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:14,400
animality is not about literal animals

1816
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:17,560
it's about unleashing what is

1817
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:20,400
symbolically animalistic in us the

1818
01:18:17,560 --> 01:18:23,400
drives and urges that human taboos and

1819
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:26,400
decency forbid people think furries are

1820
01:18:23,400 --> 01:18:28,960
weird now but your grandfather fought in

1821
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:31,679
World War II then came home and thought

1822
01:18:28,960 --> 01:18:34,280
it was totally normal to be attracted to

1823
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:36,800
women dressed like rabbits are people

1824
01:18:34,280 --> 01:18:39,679
who are into Daddy Doms or diapers or

1825
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:42,600
whatever literally normalizing

1826
01:18:39,679 --> 01:18:45,080
Pediatrics well no it's usually not

1827
01:18:42,600 --> 01:18:48,000
about that at all AG play is usually

1828
01:18:45,080 --> 01:18:50,280
about fantasy regression to the social

1829
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:52,679
position of someone who has no

1830
01:18:50,280 --> 01:18:55,120
responsibilities and needs to be taken

1831
01:18:52,679 --> 01:18:57,960
care of the fantasy or the rle play

1832
01:18:55,120 --> 01:19:01,280
scenario gives you permission to be

1833
01:18:57,960 --> 01:19:03,480
taken care of Edward Cullen's notorious

1834
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:06,040
I like to watch you sleep I like

1835
01:19:03,480 --> 01:19:09,159
watching you sleep feels creepy to a lot

1836
01:19:06,040 --> 01:19:11,280
of people and fair enough creepiness is

1837
01:19:09,159 --> 01:19:14,600
subjective but I feel like you can find

1838
01:19:11,280 --> 01:19:17,560
Edward creepy and still understand that

1839
01:19:14,600 --> 01:19:20,159
for Stephanie Meyer Twilight is not an

1840
01:19:17,560 --> 01:19:22,760
expression of a literal desire to be

1841
01:19:20,159 --> 01:19:24,960
stalked by creatures of the night the

1842
01:19:22,760 --> 01:19:28,520
fantasy is of a protector watching ing

1843
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:30,400
over you a witness a guardian angel like

1844
01:19:28,520 --> 01:19:32,280
when you're a kid and you want your mom

1845
01:19:30,400 --> 01:19:34,560
to stay in your room with you until you

1846
01:19:32,280 --> 01:19:37,360
fall asleep I wish that I could fall

1847
01:19:34,560 --> 01:19:40,199
asleep with a Vampire watching over me

1848
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:43,320
talking to me and she's saying baby

1849
01:19:40,199 --> 01:19:44,920
mommy loves you you're a good baby I

1850
01:19:43,320 --> 01:19:48,280
don't blame you for what happened to

1851
01:19:44,920 --> 01:19:51,760
this family you're just a baby you had

1852
01:19:48,280 --> 01:19:54,760
nothing to do with 9/11 in 2015 radical

1853
01:19:51,760 --> 01:19:57,199
feminist Dr Gail dyes the quote world's

1854
01:19:54,760 --> 01:19:59,440
leading anti-pornography scholar and

1855
01:19:57,199 --> 01:20:02,120
activist according to her website l a

1856
01:19:59,440 --> 01:20:06,120
boycott of 50 Shades of Gray using the

1857
01:20:02,120 --> 01:20:08,040
hashtag $50 not 50 Shades encouraging

1858
01:20:06,120 --> 01:20:11,000
people to donate to battered women's

1859
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:13,440
shelters instead of seeing the movie D

1860
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:15,719
claimed 50 Shades glamorized and

1861
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:18,360
eroticized violence against women and

1862
01:20:15,719 --> 01:20:20,320
rebranded it as romance she describes

1863
01:20:18,360 --> 01:20:23,239
going to see the movie in a theater full

1864
01:20:20,320 --> 01:20:26,080
of young women drinking cocktails and

1865
01:20:23,239 --> 01:20:29,080
watching an abject horror quote a film

1866
01:20:26,080 --> 01:20:33,040
that depicted in unbearable detail How

1867
01:20:29,080 --> 01:20:36,159
to lure a lonely isolated child into

1868
01:20:33,040 --> 01:20:38,960
consenting to sexual abuse watching a

1869
01:20:36,159 --> 01:20:41,239
seasoned Predator toy with his immature

1870
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:43,760
prey you are left with a knot in the pit

1871
01:20:41,239 --> 01:20:48,040
of your stomach that won't go away no

1872
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:51,360
matter how many cocktails you down Gail

1873
01:20:48,040 --> 01:20:53,639
it's Twilight fanfiction when I watch 50

1874
01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:55,199
Shades I don't feel like I'm watching a

1875
01:20:53,639 --> 01:20:57,320
seasoned predator

1876
01:20:55,199 --> 01:21:00,159
I feel like I'm watching a woman's

1877
01:20:57,320 --> 01:21:02,719
fantasy because I am and if people like

1878
01:21:00,159 --> 01:21:05,560
Gil Dian are too obtuse to notice the

1879
01:21:02,719 --> 01:21:07,840
difference that's kind of their problem

1880
01:21:05,560 --> 01:21:09,960
I've been holding this in for 10 years

1881
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:12,080
and I'm going to say it I am begging

1882
01:21:09,960 --> 01:21:14,719
these people to learn to think

1883
01:21:12,080 --> 01:21:16,840
psychologically instead of literally so

1884
01:21:14,719 --> 01:21:19,719
they're not constantly baffled and

1885
01:21:16,840 --> 01:21:22,440
traumatized upon encountering literally

1886
01:21:19,719 --> 01:21:24,080
the most common type of sexual fantasy

1887
01:21:22,440 --> 01:21:26,719
that people have I guess when you're

1888
01:21:24,080 --> 01:21:28,840
only analytic tool is a sledgehammer you

1889
01:21:26,719 --> 01:21:31,760
see every problem as an author whose

1890
01:21:28,840 --> 01:21:33,760
legs aren't hobbled yet it's frustrating

1891
01:21:31,760 --> 01:21:36,199
because there's plenty of more nuanced

1892
01:21:33,760 --> 01:21:38,480
criticism of pornography especially when

1893
01:21:36,199 --> 01:21:40,639
it's produced coercively or when it

1894
01:21:38,480 --> 01:21:43,040
functions as a replacement for actual

1895
01:21:40,639 --> 01:21:46,199
sex education but I reject the radical

1896
01:21:43,040 --> 01:21:48,560
feminist idea that consuming pornography

1897
01:21:46,199 --> 01:21:50,719
is a major cause of violence and I

1898
01:21:48,560 --> 01:21:54,360
should know because I'm a very violent

1899
01:21:50,719 --> 01:21:56,360
person and I never consume pornography I

1900
01:21:54,360 --> 01:21:58,320
guess I also need to address that for

1901
01:21:56,360 --> 01:22:00,440
every radical feminist who thinks that

1902
01:21:58,320 --> 01:22:02,719
Twilight fanfiction is literally

1903
01:22:00,440 --> 01:22:05,199
violence there's also a thousand

1904
01:22:02,719 --> 01:22:08,040
misogynistic idiots who will argue that

1905
01:22:05,199 --> 01:22:10,840
dark romance fantasies prove that women

1906
01:22:08,040 --> 01:22:15,920
really want to be dominated by abusive

1907
01:22:10,840 --> 01:22:18,280
alpha males which no stop no fantasizing

1908
01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:20,880
about sexy vampires doesn't make you a

1909
01:22:18,280 --> 01:22:23,080
willing victim any more than fantasizing

1910
01:22:20,880 --> 01:22:25,760
about torpedoing a car holding up

1911
01:22:23,080 --> 01:22:28,199
traffic makes you a murder I fantasize

1912
01:22:25,760 --> 01:22:30,239
about Mario Kart shelling bad drivers

1913
01:22:28,199 --> 01:22:32,159
all the time it doesn't mean I literally

1914
01:22:30,239 --> 01:22:34,800
want Bloodshed on the New Jersey

1915
01:22:32,159 --> 01:22:37,760
Turnpike unless they're asking for it as

1916
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:41,280
zarra spake we have a name a perfect

1917
01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:43,639
name for Fantasy realized it's called

1918
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:46,199
nightmare our violent and twisted

1919
01:22:43,639 --> 01:22:48,560
fantasies are unconscious solutions to

1920
01:22:46,199 --> 01:22:51,239
the problem of anxiety and really we're

1921
01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:55,000
all just seeking pleasure and safety so

1922
01:22:51,239 --> 01:22:57,040
probably it's fine right it's fine

1923
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:59,440
a little bit of healthy sadism never

1924
01:22:57,040 --> 01:22:59,440
hurt

1925
01:23:02,320 --> 01:23:08,840
anyone part four power is it really fine

1926
01:23:06,840 --> 01:23:11,280
though we're not done we're not even

1927
01:23:08,840 --> 01:23:13,120
close to done I'm just getting warmed up

1928
01:23:11,280 --> 01:23:15,320
what feels incomplete to me about the

1929
01:23:13,120 --> 01:23:18,000
it's just fantasy argument is that

1930
01:23:15,320 --> 01:23:19,880
Twilight is a fantasy yes but it's a

1931
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:21,719
fantasy that reflects something real

1932
01:23:19,880 --> 01:23:23,960
about the sexual Dynamics between men

1933
01:23:21,719 --> 01:23:25,440
and women I mostly agree with Nancy

1934
01:23:23,960 --> 01:23:28,080
Friday's and Michael Bader's

1935
01:23:25,440 --> 01:23:30,639
psychological analysis of fantasies but

1936
01:23:28,080 --> 01:23:33,040
psychology without material analysis of

1937
01:23:30,639 --> 01:23:35,159
power fails to explain some important

1938
01:23:33,040 --> 01:23:37,120
things this becomes really obvious with

1939
01:23:35,159 --> 01:23:39,280
sexual fantasies involving racial

1940
01:23:37,120 --> 01:23:42,000
fetishism for example there's a chapter

1941
01:23:39,280 --> 01:23:44,440
of Nancy Friday's book titled big black

1942
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:46,120
men which is exactly what it sounds like

1943
01:23:44,440 --> 01:23:48,760
the fantasies of white women who are

1944
01:23:46,120 --> 01:23:51,320
turned on by an animalistic stereotype

1945
01:23:48,760 --> 01:23:53,679
of black men it's a racial fixation

1946
01:23:51,320 --> 01:23:56,040
that's very much present as subtext in

1947
01:23:53,679 --> 01:23:58,000
Twilight I leave you alone for 2 minutes

1948
01:23:56,040 --> 01:24:00,960
and the Wolves descend Jacob is

1949
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:03,480
indigenous he transforms into an animal

1950
01:24:00,960 --> 01:24:06,120
his last name is literally black we were

1951
01:24:03,480 --> 01:24:08,400
great spirit Warriors they transformed

1952
01:24:06,120 --> 01:24:11,239
to the powerful wolf oh God are the

1953
01:24:08,400 --> 01:24:13,080
werewolves lamanites Stephanie I regret

1954
01:24:11,239 --> 01:24:15,199
to inform you that the cuck tent is

1955
01:24:13,080 --> 01:24:17,360
racist we could try to psychoanalyze all

1956
01:24:15,199 --> 01:24:19,400
of this the bigness in question

1957
01:24:17,360 --> 01:24:21,880
referring not just to Anatomy but to the

1958
01:24:19,400 --> 01:24:24,800
intensity of Desire the exciting taboo

1959
01:24:21,880 --> 01:24:27,000
of otherness animalization as a shame

1960
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:29,239
negating device and all of that may be

1961
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:31,600
true but aren't these fantasies still a

1962
01:24:29,239 --> 01:24:34,760
reflection and possibly a reinforcement

1963
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:37,600
of unjust political reality in his 2016

1964
01:24:34,760 --> 01:24:39,840
essay decolonizing my desire slave play

1965
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:42,000
author Jeremy o' Harris describes his

1966
01:24:39,840 --> 01:24:44,480
experience as a black gay teenager who

1967
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:46,520
became erotically fixated on white men

1968
01:24:44,480 --> 01:24:49,159
because to him whiteness represented

1969
01:24:46,520 --> 01:24:51,000
power and Prestige he concludes that by

1970
01:24:49,159 --> 01:24:54,440
obsessing over white bodies and white

1971
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:56,639
validation quote I was failing to exist

1972
01:24:54,440 --> 01:24:58,600
I don't see myself as some kind of moral

1973
01:24:56,639 --> 01:25:01,320
judge of who's allowed to fantasize

1974
01:24:58,600 --> 01:25:02,960
about what but I've noticed people are

1975
01:25:01,320 --> 01:25:05,360
usually way less comfortable with

1976
01:25:02,960 --> 01:25:07,440
fantasies rooted in racism than they are

1977
01:25:05,360 --> 01:25:10,159
with fantasies about powerful men

1978
01:25:07,440 --> 01:25:12,920
dominating submissive women but is that

1979
01:25:10,159 --> 01:25:14,880
justifiable have men not dominated women

1980
01:25:12,920 --> 01:25:16,920
throughout history Stephanie Meyer

1981
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:19,199
didn't invent this story about a male

1982
01:25:16,920 --> 01:25:21,440
predator in his female prey out of thin

1983
01:25:19,199 --> 01:25:23,920
air don't a lot of girls grow up being

1984
01:25:21,440 --> 01:25:24,840
treated as a kind of sexual prey to male

1985
01:25:23,920 --> 01:25:26,600
predators

1986
01:25:24,840 --> 01:25:28,679
doesn't that have some kind of influence

1987
01:25:26,600 --> 01:25:30,679
on the fantasies that women have and

1988
01:25:28,679 --> 01:25:33,080
can't fantasy sometimes influence

1989
01:25:30,679 --> 01:25:36,000
reality according to criminologist Scott

1990
01:25:33,080 --> 01:25:37,840
B the Behavioral Science unit of the FBI

1991
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:39,880
has concluded that serial killers

1992
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:42,119
programmed themselves in childhood to

1993
01:25:39,880 --> 01:25:44,880
become murderers through a progressively

1994
01:25:42,119 --> 01:25:48,000
intensifying Loop of fantasy I can

1995
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:50,400
confirm this my question is are fantasy

1996

power dynamics simply the result of

1997
01:25:50,400 --> 01:25:54,679
political inequality or is there

1998
01:25:52,400 --> 01:25:57,280
something inherently vampiric about

1999
01:25:54,679 --> 01:26:00,440
sexuality itself according to leapold

2013
01:26:33,639 --> 01:26:38,159
is that the man is The Lion and the

2014
01:26:35,800 --> 01:26:40,199
woman is the lamb but gay people are

2015
01:26:38,159 --> 01:26:42,880
hardly exempt from aligning with these

2016
01:26:40,199 --> 01:26:45,159
types of roles top and bottom some

2017
01:26:42,880 --> 01:26:47,320
people are born straight and others have

2018
01:26:45,159 --> 01:26:50,400
straightness thrust upon them let's call

2019
01:26:47,320 --> 01:26:53,520

2021
01:26:53,520 --> 01:26:59,400
going to say it a lot dhsm this division

2022
01:26:56,800 --> 01:27:02,199
of sexuality into bipolar roles

2023
01:26:59,400 --> 01:27:05,480

2029
01:27:17,320 --> 01:27:22,560
sadistic masochistic in reality none of

2030
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:25,480
these rules are interchangeable or even

2031
01:27:22,560 --> 01:27:28,360
necessarily correlated being masculine

2032
01:27:25,480 --> 01:27:31,040
does not imply being a top and neither

2033
01:27:28,360 --> 01:27:33,760
imply being dominant masculinity is

2034
01:27:31,040 --> 01:27:36,480
gender expression top is a sexual

2035
01:27:33,760 --> 01:27:39,600
position and dominant is a role in a

2036
01:27:36,480 --> 01:27:41,960
power Dynamic but in dhsm these roles

2037
01:27:39,600 --> 01:27:44,360
are assumed to be bundled together and

2038
01:27:41,960 --> 01:27:46,960
assumed to belong to the sexuality of

2039
01:27:44,360 --> 01:27:49,000
men when I say satom masochism I don't

2040
01:27:46,960 --> 01:27:51,119
just mean the narrow sense of enjoying

2041
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:53,719
or inflicting pain but this whole

2042
01:27:51,119 --> 01:27:56,040
dynamic of dominance and submission male

2043
01:27:53,719 --> 01:27:59,360
dominance is so much the heterosexual

2044
01:27:56,040 --> 01:28:01,960
default that female dominance or femdom

2045
01:27:59,360 --> 01:28:05,400
is usually considered a kink that is

2046
01:28:01,960 --> 01:28:07,480
it's considered deviant dhsm defines

2047
01:28:05,400 --> 01:28:09,840
heterosexuality as the dominance of

2048
01:28:07,480 --> 01:28:12,040
women by men men who are perceived as

2049
01:28:09,840 --> 01:28:15,000
submissive to women are sometimes called

2050
01:28:12,040 --> 01:28:17,239
Gay over such a mascula behavior as

2051
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:20,000
leaning towards a woman pleasuring a

2052
01:28:17,239 --> 01:28:23,119
woman walking behind a woman and holding

2053
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:25,400
the baby he sired with a woman dhsm is

2054
01:28:23,119 --> 01:28:27,440
woven into so much of our language about

2055
01:28:25,400 --> 01:28:30,840
sexuality think about the implications

2056
01:28:27,440 --> 01:28:33,560
of the term impotence literally loss of

2057
01:28:30,840 --> 01:28:35,880
power implying that phallic sexuality is

2058
01:28:33,560 --> 01:28:38,320
fundamentally about power there's a

2059
01:28:35,880 --> 01:28:40,920
strong association between masculinity

2060
01:28:38,320 --> 01:28:44,000
and predation meat is considered

2061
01:28:40,920 --> 01:28:46,520

boy Edward Cullen is a vegetarian

2063

vampire he's vegetarian because without

2064
01:28:48,840 --> 01:28:53,080
a guilty conscience he would be

2065
01:28:50,840 --> 01:28:55,679
incapable of love but it's important

2066
01:28:53,080 --> 01:28:58,840
that he be a vampire because his blood

2067
01:28:55,679 --> 01:29:01,600
lust gives him his dangerous verile edge

2068
01:28:58,840 --> 01:29:04,520
I want my man to be a predator not a cow

we all supposedly men hunt while women

2072
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:16,080
gather but in dhsm women become the meat

2073
01:29:15,040 --> 01:29:19,040
just looks at you like you're something

2074
01:29:16,080 --> 01:29:21,760
to eat in the sexual politics of meat

2075
01:29:19,040 --> 01:29:23,600
vegan feminist Carol J Adams argues for

2076
01:29:21,760 --> 01:29:25,679
the interrelation of the oppression of

2077
01:29:23,600 --> 01:29:28,040
women and the slaughter of animals she

2078
01:29:25,679 --> 01:29:30,320
wants to abolish both forms of Cruelty

likewise erotic media for women tends to

2088
01:29:53,719 --> 01:29:58,520
involve themes of submission and

troubling concerning that not just in

fantasy but in reality satom masochism

2097
01:30:17,239 --> 01:30:22,760
often reflects the social political and

2098
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:25,159
sexual domination of women by men

default heterosexual stom masochism the

2101
01:30:27,679 --> 01:30:33,080
result of biological predisposition

2102
01:30:30,360 --> 01:30:35,239
Freud says the sexuality of most male

2103
01:30:33,080 --> 01:30:38,040
human beings contains an element of

2104
01:30:35,239 --> 01:30:40,239
aggressiveness a desire to subjugate

01:30:40,239 --> 01:30:44,639
Deutch argued likewise that quote

masochism is part of the woman's

2108
01:30:44,639 --> 01:30:49,000
anatomical Destiny she thought that

2109
01:30:47,040 --> 01:30:51,239
female masochism results from the

2110
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:54,400
inherent pain of women's reproductive

2111
01:30:51,239 --> 01:30:56,600
role defloration menstruation and child

2112
01:30:54,400 --> 01:30:58,760
birth it's really just a secular version

2113
01:30:56,600 --> 01:31:01,560
of the biblical view that women's

2114
01:30:58,760 --> 01:31:03,639
Destiny is pain and submission in sorrow

2115
01:31:01,560 --> 01:31:05,679
Thou shalt bring forth children and thy

2116
01:31:03,639 --> 01:31:07,920
desire shall be to thy husband and he

2117
01:31:05,679 --> 01:31:10,159
shall rule over thee a lot of 20th

2118
01:31:07,920 --> 01:31:12,960
century feminist theory was devoted to

2119
01:31:10,159 --> 01:31:15,639
arguing against this idea of anatomical

2120
01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:18,000
Destiny feminists have tended to argue

2121
01:31:15,639 --> 01:31:20,520
that male sadism and female masochism

2122
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:22,880
are purely the result of patriarchy of

2123
01:31:20,520 --> 01:31:24,880
male social dominance the idea is that

2124
01:31:22,880 --> 01:31:27,239
women learn to desire desire submission

2125
01:31:24,880 --> 01:31:29,159
from their inferior social position and

2126
01:31:27,239 --> 01:31:31,080
Men learn to desire dominating and

2127
01:31:29,159 --> 01:31:33,760
degrading women from their Superior

2128
01:31:31,080 --> 01:31:36,320
position in the 1980s a common radical

2129
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:38,800
feminist view was that male and female

2130
01:31:36,320 --> 01:31:40,159
are not natural categories at all but

2131
01:31:38,800 --> 01:31:42,760
that they're constructed through

2132
01:31:40,159 --> 01:31:45,679
violence and exploitation analogous to

2133
01:31:42,760 --> 01:31:48,080
bisi and proletariat radical feminist

Katherine McKinnon says male and female

2135
01:31:48,080 --> 01:31:53,880
are created through the erotization of

2136
01:31:50,480 --> 01:31:56,920
dominance and submission man woman sub

2138
01:31:56,920 --> 01:32:01,280
are distinguished from women by their

2139
01:31:58,960 --> 01:32:04,239
commitment to do violence rather than to

2140
01:32:01,280 --> 01:32:06,880
be victimized by it notice how at odds

2141
01:32:04,239 --> 01:32:09,360
this is with JK Rowling's formulation

2142
01:32:06,880 --> 01:32:10,760
sex is real which some radical feminists

2143
01:32:09,360 --> 01:32:13,239
would once have considered the

2144
01:32:10,760 --> 01:32:15,440
constitutive statement of sexism there's

2145
01:32:13,239 --> 01:32:18,400
been a return to anatomical Destiny

2146
01:32:15,440 --> 01:32:20,639
lately in the form of turism that is

2147
01:32:18,400 --> 01:32:23,159
post-feminist conservative bigotry

2148
01:32:20,639 --> 01:32:25,679
against trans people Ring's transphobic

2149
01:32:23,159 --> 01:32:28,360
arguments often hinge on an assumption

2150
01:32:25,679 --> 01:32:31,719
that males are natural predators and

2151
01:32:28,360 --> 01:32:34,400
females are natural prey or as alien sex

01:32:31,719 --> 01:32:36,360
inspector Maya forer puts it in the

2153
01:32:34,400 --> 01:32:38,800
context of Prisons it is a hoe that

2154
01:32:36,360 --> 01:32:41,360
matters women have a hole which men want

2155
01:32:38,800 --> 01:32:43,199
to penetrate bluntly the reason we have

2156
01:32:41,360 --> 01:32:45,840
men and women's prisons is to keep the

2157
01:32:43,199 --> 01:32:48,159
men away from the hes this is anatomical

2158
01:32:45,840 --> 01:32:51,119
Destiny at the kindergarten level woman

2159
01:32:48,159 --> 01:32:54,360
equals hole man equals pole therefore

2160
01:32:51,119 --> 01:32:57,080
man equals Predator woman equals prey I

2161
01:32:54,360 --> 01:32:59,840
like the pole and the hole turfs think

2162
01:32:57,080 --> 01:33:02,320
the Omega verse is real that men are

2163
01:32:59,840 --> 01:33:05,239
anatomical alphas and women are

anatomical omegas Stephanie Meyer takes

2165
01:33:05,239 --> 01:33:09,600
a more gender fluid view in the

maintained that it would have made no

2169
01:33:13,440 --> 01:33:17,639
difference if the human were male and

2170
01:33:15,159 --> 01:33:20,320
the vampire female it's still the same

2171
01:33:17,639 --> 01:33:23,280
story and are there not male masochists

2172
01:33:20,320 --> 01:33:25,719
and female ssts masochism is named after

2173
01:33:23,280 --> 01:33:27,960
a man a man who once said nothing

2174
01:33:25,719 --> 01:33:30,440
Kindles my passion quite so much as

2175
01:33:27,960 --> 01:33:33,040
tyranny cruelty and above all

2176
01:33:30,440 --> 01:33:35,600
unfaithfulness in a beautiful woman send

2177
01:33:33,040 --> 01:33:38,040
him to the tent send him to the

2178
01:33:35,600 --> 01:33:41,080
tent of cuckoldry even if there is an

2179
01:33:38,040 --> 01:33:44,119
anatomical disposition of men to sadism

2180
01:33:41,080 --> 01:33:46,600
and women to masochism disposition is

2181
01:33:44,119 --> 01:33:49,159
not Destiny both men and women are

2182
01:33:46,600 --> 01:33:52,199
anatomically capable of being the hammer

2183
01:33:49,159 --> 01:33:54,639
or the envil the predator or the prey so

2184
01:33:52,199 --> 01:33:56,760
I think that feminists are most correct

2185
01:33:54,639 --> 01:33:59,080
to point to the history of male social

2186
01:33:56,760 --> 01:34:01,600
dominance as the reason for default

2187
01:33:59,080 --> 01:34:04,679
gendered roles until the married women's

2188
01:34:01,600 --> 01:34:06,800
property Act of 1870 English women were

2189
01:34:04,679 --> 01:34:08,800
subject to a system called coverture

2190
01:34:06,800 --> 01:34:11,239
meaning that when a woman married her

2191
01:34:08,800 --> 01:34:12,880
entire legal existence was subsumed

2192
01:34:11,239 --> 01:34:14,719
under that of her husband and she

2193
01:34:12,880 --> 01:34:17,520
effectively lost the right to own

2194
01:34:14,719 --> 01:34:20,600
property or make contracts in the US it

2195
01:34:17,520 --> 01:34:22,760
was only as recently as 1974 that women

2196
01:34:20,600 --> 01:34:24,600
won the right to open Independent bank

2197
01:34:22,760 --> 01:34:27,719
accounts the same year they started

2198
01:34:24,600 --> 01:34:29,760
having sexual fantasies amazing so

2199
01:34:27,719 --> 01:34:32,239
historically the erotic and economic

2200
01:34:29,760 --> 01:34:34,320
fates of women have been fused it's the

2201
01:34:32,239 --> 01:34:36,199
key to historical romance novels like

2202
01:34:34,320 --> 01:34:37,960
Pride and Prejudice where the tension is

2203
01:34:36,199 --> 01:34:40,360
between Elizabeth's desire for a

2204
01:34:37,960 --> 01:34:42,800
marriage of love and her economic need

2205
01:34:40,360 --> 01:34:45,679
for a marriage of security incels like

2206
01:34:42,800 --> 01:34:48,320
to complain about female hypergamy and

2207
01:34:45,679 --> 01:34:50,040
Mr Bennett sits around making sarcastic

2208
01:34:48,320 --> 01:34:52,360
quips about it that's right we're coming

2209
01:34:50,040 --> 01:34:54,080
from Mr Bennett in this video nothing is

2210
01:34:52,360 --> 01:34:56,480
sacred but women's preference for

2211
01:34:54,080 --> 01:34:58,159
wealthy powerful Partners is the result

2212
01:34:56,480 --> 01:35:00,880
of gender rules that make women

2213
01:34:58,159 --> 01:35:03,760
dependent and subservient women are not

2214
01:35:00,880 --> 01:35:05,719
biologically attracted to Providers

2215
01:35:03,760 --> 01:35:07,560
Elizabeth and then Lydia are initially

2216
01:35:05,719 --> 01:35:10,520
attracted to Wickham even though he has

2217
01:35:07,560 --> 01:35:12,600
no money in Titanic upper class Rose is

2218
01:35:10,520 --> 01:35:14,280
attracted to workingclass Leo in

2219
01:35:12,600 --> 01:35:16,760
weathering Heights Catherine is

2220
01:35:14,280 --> 01:35:18,639
attracted to feral dog boy heathcliffe

2221
01:35:16,760 --> 01:35:21,440
and in Twilight Bella is attracted to

2222
01:35:18,639 --> 01:35:23,920
feral dog boy Jacob women are attracted

2223
01:35:21,440 --> 01:35:25,960
to disempowered and impoverished men all

2224
01:35:23,920 --> 01:35:28,560
the time but because of their social and

2225
01:35:25,960 --> 01:35:30,760
economic dependence for most of History

2226
01:35:28,560 --> 01:35:33,800
a story about a woman who loves a lower

2227
01:35:30,760 --> 01:35:36,520
class man is not a romance it's a

2228
01:35:33,800 --> 01:35:39,000
tragedy Catherine says it would degrade

2229
01:35:36,520 --> 01:35:42,520
me to marry heathcliffe if the boy is

2230
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:45,600
poor there's no room on the door so I'm

2231
01:35:42,520 --> 01:35:48,239
prepared to believe that most of dhsm is

2232
01:35:45,600 --> 01:35:51,080
the result of class struggle and not of

2233
01:35:48,239 --> 01:35:53,719
genital Anatomy but either way how do we

2234
01:35:51,080 --> 01:35:55,800
explain male masochists how do we

2235
01:35:53,719 --> 01:35:59,000
explain gay or lesbian people who

2236
01:35:55,800 --> 01:36:01,080
practice BDSM or who identify as tops or

2237
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:04,119
bottoms why does there need to be a

2238
01:36:01,080 --> 01:36:06,239
hammer or an anvil at all do we need

2239
01:36:04,119 --> 01:36:08,560
sexual hierarchy can't we just have a

2240
01:36:06,239 --> 01:36:12,400
sexuality based on gentleness and

2241
01:36:08,560 --> 01:36:14,760
equality and Humane Democratic Values

2242
01:36:12,400 --> 01:36:17,320
well that is exactly the question that

2243
01:36:14,760 --> 01:36:20,600
divided feminists in the 1980s a

2244
01:36:17,320 --> 01:36:23,119
conflict known as the feminist Sex Wars

2245
01:36:20,600 --> 01:36:26,360
and I'm bringing it back let's have a

2246
01:36:23,119 --> 01:36:26,360
feminist sex

2247
01:36:26,560 --> 01:36:31,360
War so look I'm now going to try to

2248
01:36:29,480 --> 01:36:33,639
fairly present the arguments of sex

2249
01:36:31,360 --> 01:36:36,280
negative radical feminism which fair

2250
01:36:33,639 --> 01:36:37,639
warning can be difficult to hear because

2251
01:36:36,280 --> 01:36:39,719
they're kind of saying that your most

2252
01:36:37,639 --> 01:36:41,960
intimate desires and relationships are

2253
01:36:39,719 --> 01:36:44,159
founded on violence and Injustice and

2254
01:36:41,960 --> 01:36:46,199
I'm trans so I'm used to constantly

2255
01:36:44,159 --> 01:36:48,600
having to defend my sexuality but

2256
01:36:46,199 --> 01:36:51,360
straight people this might be new to you

2257
01:36:48,600 --> 01:36:54,199
so strap in you should put your seat Bel

2258
01:36:51,360 --> 01:36:56,400
on you should put your seat belt on sex

2259
01:36:54,199 --> 01:36:58,960
negative feminism is a backlash against

2260
01:36:56,400 --> 01:37:01,000
the sexual revolution of the 60s and70s

2261
01:36:58,960 --> 01:37:03,239
the general idea of the sexual

2262
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:05,840
Revolution was that sexuality should be

2263
01:37:03,239 --> 01:37:08,159
liberated from Marriage from the state

2264
01:37:05,840 --> 01:37:10,600
from religion and from the imperative to

2265
01:37:08,159 --> 01:37:13,560
procreate the radical feminist objection

2266
01:37:10,600 --> 01:37:16,159
to it was basically that in practice the

2267
01:37:13,560 --> 01:37:18,560
sexual Revolution was only a liberation

2268
01:37:16,159 --> 01:37:20,440
of men's desire to dominate women

2269
01:37:18,560 --> 01:37:22,679
radical feminist Andrea dworin says

2270
01:37:20,440 --> 01:37:24,440
quote Freedom that hallowed word is

2271
01:37:22,679 --> 01:37:26,920
valued only when when used in reference

2272
01:37:24,440 --> 01:37:29,000
to male desire for women Freedom means

2273
01:37:26,920 --> 01:37:32,040
only that men are free to use them

2274
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:34,639
sexual Libertarians sometimes imply that

2275
01:37:32,040 --> 01:37:36,679
sexual repression is inherently bad but

2276
01:37:34,639 --> 01:37:39,239
many women experience violence at the

2277
01:37:36,679 --> 01:37:42,239
hands of men whose sexuality is not

2278
01:37:39,239 --> 01:37:45,280
repressed enough to those women freedom

2279
01:37:42,239 --> 01:37:48,719
of sexuality may seem less important

2280
01:37:45,280 --> 01:37:51,679
than freedom from sexuality sometimes

2281
01:37:48,719 --> 01:37:54,360
sexual repression is good freedom for

2282
01:37:51,679 --> 01:37:56,960
the lion is not freedom for the lamb the

2283
01:37:54,360 --> 01:37:59,840
question is is it possible to liberate

2284
01:37:56,960 --> 01:38:02,159
sex without liberating violence and for

2285
01:37:59,840 --> 01:38:05,040
sex negative feminists the answer is

2286
01:38:02,159 --> 01:38:07,360
basically no as they see it we have to

2287
01:38:05,040 --> 01:38:09,320
choose between sexuality and women's

2288
01:38:07,360 --> 01:38:11,679
rights and we should choose women's

2289
01:38:09,320 --> 01:38:14,719
rights this is a tough settle for most

2290
01:38:11,679 --> 01:38:16,960
people but okay let's hear it out the

2291
01:38:14,719 --> 01:38:19,840
final boss of sex negative feminism is

2292
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:22,560
former academic Sheila Jeff quote the

2293
01:38:19,840 --> 01:38:24,560
demolition of heterosexual desire is a

2294
01:38:22,560 --> 01:38:27,239
necessary step on the route to women's

2295
01:38:24,560 --> 01:38:30,119
Liberation good luck with that now I

2296
01:38:27,239 --> 01:38:32,520
love Sheila Jeff I think she's hilarious

2297
01:38:30,119 --> 01:38:35,320
but I'm an intellectual Mist I get off

2298
01:38:32,520 --> 01:38:38,239
on bad ideas my tastes are

2299
01:38:35,320 --> 01:38:40,040
very singular these days Sheila Jeff

2300
01:38:38,239 --> 01:38:42,119
Blends in as just another generic

2301
01:38:40,040 --> 01:38:44,040
English transphobe these people are a

2302
01:38:42,119 --> 01:38:46,080
diamond dozen the problem is that men

2303
01:38:44,040 --> 01:38:47,199
doing Woman face are insulting to women

2304
01:38:46,080 --> 01:38:49,320
when they're just walking down the

2305
01:38:47,199 --> 01:38:51,119
street or sitting in a cafe activities

2306
01:38:49,320 --> 01:38:53,679
for which they need an unwilling

2307
01:38:51,119 --> 01:38:55,719
audience of women in order to get sexual

2308
01:38:53,679 --> 01:38:57,080
excitement she goes on podcasts and

2309
01:38:55,719 --> 01:38:59,320
talks about how trans women are

2310
01:38:57,080 --> 01:39:02,119
perverted fetishists parasitically

2311
01:38:59,320 --> 01:39:03,599
occupying female bodies which yeah yeah

2312
01:39:02,119 --> 01:39:06,119
yeah that is now the mainstream

2313
01:39:03,599 --> 01:39:08,599
conservative view so thank you for that

2314
01:39:06,119 --> 01:39:10,760
Sheila Sheila Jeff actually pioneered a

2315
01:39:08,599 --> 01:39:13,679
lot of these transphobic arguments she

2316
01:39:10,760 --> 01:39:15,960
walked so that JK Rowling could run give

2317
01:39:13,679 --> 01:39:18,440
the devil her du Sheila's 2020

2318
01:39:15,960 --> 01:39:20,119
autobiography is titled trigger warning

2319
01:39:18,440 --> 01:39:22,000
which should give you some idea of where

2320
01:39:20,119 --> 01:39:23,920
she stands in the current culture War

2321
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:26,400
like a hack comedian who hasn't been

2322
01:39:23,920 --> 01:39:29,320
funny in 30 years I guess even lesbians

2323
01:39:26,400 --> 01:39:31,560
aren't immune to Boomer brainworms sad

2324
01:39:29,320 --> 01:39:33,159
but back in the ' 80s and '90s sheilo is

2325
01:39:31,560 --> 01:39:36,440
actually saying some genuinely

2326
01:39:33,159 --> 01:39:38,679
subversive things not good things but

2327
01:39:36,440 --> 01:39:41,480
subversive that quote about demolishing

2328
01:39:38,679 --> 01:39:44,679
heterosexual desire is from her 1990

2329
01:39:41,480 --> 01:39:47,040
book anticlimax a feminist perspective

2330
01:39:44,679 --> 01:39:50,440
on the sexual Revolution which is an

2331
01:39:47,040 --> 01:39:52,719
amazingly bad book on sex and gender not

2332
01:39:50,440 --> 01:39:54,560
just because of the transphobia not just

2333
01:39:52,719 --> 01:39:56,639
because of bizarre claims like that

2334
01:39:54,560 --> 01:39:59,639
women today are required to wear

2335
01:39:56,639 --> 01:40:01,920
mandatory pumps at the office but

2336
01:39:59,639 --> 01:40:05,159
also because of the absurdly Bold stance

2337
01:40:01,920 --> 01:40:07,639
she takes on abolishing heterosexuality

2338
01:40:05,159 --> 01:40:09,800
which I realize may sound based as the

2339
01:40:07,639 --> 01:40:12,639
kids say I'm down with the kids but it

2340
01:40:09,800 --> 01:40:14,760
is in fact cringe this book is bad but

2341
01:40:12,639 --> 01:40:16,320
it's bad in a way that is legitimately

2342
01:40:14,760 --> 01:40:18,520
fascinating in a way that we can all

2343
01:40:16,320 --> 01:40:20,639
learn from so according to Sheila the

2344
01:40:18,520 --> 01:40:22,800
end goal of feminism is quote the

2345
01:40:20,639 --> 01:40:25,360
destruction of heterosexuality as a

2346
01:40:22,800 --> 01:40:28,679
system she was influenced by radfem Jill

2347
01:40:25,360 --> 01:40:31,400
Johnson who in 1973 said feminism at

2348
01:40:28,679 --> 01:40:33,679
heart is a massive complaint lesbianism

2349
01:40:31,400 --> 01:40:36,119
is the solution until all women are

2350
01:40:33,679 --> 01:40:37,719
lesbians there will be no true political

2351
01:40:36,119 --> 01:40:41,480
revolution these people were dead

2352
01:40:37,719 --> 01:40:43,360
serious this is not a bit in 1979 Sheila

2353
01:40:41,480 --> 01:40:45,520
Jeff co-authored with the Leeds

2354
01:40:43,360 --> 01:40:48,199
revolutionary feminist group a paper

2355
01:40:45,520 --> 01:40:50,480
titled political lesbianism the case

2356
01:40:48,199 --> 01:40:51,920
against heterosexuality if I try to

2357
01:40:50,480 --> 01:40:53,719
summarize it you'll think that I'm

2358
01:40:51,920 --> 01:40:55,560
drawing a caricature so I'm just going

2359
01:40:53,719 --> 01:40:57,400
to read you some direct quotes and I

2360
01:40:55,560 --> 01:40:59,360
encourage you to go read it yourself to

2361
01:40:57,400 --> 01:41:02,440
verify that I'm not taking things out of

2362
01:40:59,360 --> 01:41:05,000
context quote serious feminists have no

2363
01:41:02,440 --> 01:41:07,679
choice but to abandon heterosexuality

2364
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:10,199
men are the enemy heterosexual women are

2365
01:41:07,679 --> 01:41:11,880
collaborators With the Enemy attached to

2366
01:41:10,199 --> 01:41:13,880
all forms of sexual behavior are

2367
01:41:11,880 --> 01:41:16,000
meanings of dominance and submission

2368
01:41:13,880 --> 01:41:18,320
power and powerlessness conquest and

2369
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:20,800
humiliation any woman who takes part in

2370
01:41:18,320 --> 01:41:23,560
a heterosexual couple helps to shore up

2371
01:41:20,800 --> 01:41:26,440
male Supremacy by making its foundations

2372
01:41:23,560 --> 01:41:28,440
stronger so how do you think this paper

2373
01:41:26,440 --> 01:41:30,520
was received by the women's Liberation

2374
01:41:28,440 --> 01:41:33,239
movement you probably won't be surprised

2375
01:41:30,520 --> 01:41:34,960
to hear that it was not hugely popular

2376
01:41:33,239 --> 01:41:37,159
when Sheila presented these arguments on

2377
01:41:34,960 --> 01:41:39,639
a panel the Socialist feminist Lynn

2378
01:41:37,159 --> 01:41:42,639
seagull said the speech made her feel as

2379
01:41:39,639 --> 01:41:44,560
if she had been shot Sheila says at the

2380
01:41:42,639 --> 01:41:46,719
time we were not able to understand why

2381
01:41:44,560 --> 01:41:48,719
the paper had provoked such a virent

2382
01:41:46,719 --> 01:41:50,679
attack I can't imagine why feminists

2383
01:41:48,719 --> 01:41:52,440
would be so hostile to me simply

2384
01:41:50,679 --> 01:41:53,840
pointing out that all women in

2385
01:41:52,440 --> 01:41:56,199
relationships with men are

2386
01:41:53,840 --> 01:41:58,719
counterrevolutionary traitors one hears

2387
01:41:56,199 --> 01:42:01,880
such arguments and what can one say but

2388
01:41:58,719 --> 01:42:04,679
Sheila Jeff as Jack halber stem said if

2389
01:42:01,880 --> 01:42:06,480
Sheila Jeff didn't exist Camille Pia

2390
01:42:04,679 --> 01:42:07,840
would have had to invent her I promise

2391
01:42:06,480 --> 01:42:09,800
it's funny if you know who these people

2392
01:42:07,840 --> 01:42:11,760
are please clap I mean it's one thing to

2393
01:42:09,800 --> 01:42:14,000
seek Community with other women who

2394
01:42:11,760 --> 01:42:16,080
renounce relationships with men and are

2395
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:17,679
therefore excluded from the vicarious

2396
01:42:16,080 --> 01:42:19,800
power that comes with that every

2397
01:42:17,679 --> 01:42:22,440
marginalized Community has a separatist

2398
01:42:19,800 --> 01:42:24,560
Fringe which can be a valid choice but

2399
01:42:22,440 --> 01:42:27,080
where things get cuckoo bananas is when

2400
01:42:24,560 --> 01:42:29,360
you insist that all feminists must

2401
01:42:27,080 --> 01:42:31,400
renounce relationships with men because

2402
01:42:29,360 --> 01:42:33,400
I'm sorry to say but that will literally

2403
01:42:31,400 --> 01:42:35,320
never happen and this kind of thing only

2404
01:42:33,400 --> 01:42:38,040
divides the left when we should be

2405
01:42:35,320 --> 01:42:40,080
United against the Real Enemy the vosai

2406
01:42:38,040 --> 01:42:41,960
counterrevolutionaries but there's an

2407
01:42:40,080 --> 01:42:43,880
abstract kind of logic to Sheila's

2408
01:42:41,960 --> 01:42:46,440
argument you could put it like this

2409
01:42:43,880 --> 01:42:49,080
premise one power imbalances in sexual

2410
01:42:46,440 --> 01:42:51,360
relationships are oppressive premise two

2411
01:42:49,080 --> 01:42:53,800
under patriarchy men as a class have

2412
01:42:51,360 --> 01:42:55,560
power over women therefore any sexual

2413
01:42:53,800 --> 01:42:58,000
relationship between a man and a woman

2414
01:42:55,560 --> 01:42:59,560
involves a power imbalance therefore all

2415
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:01,920
heterosexual relationships are

2416
01:42:59,560 --> 01:43:03,800
oppressive therefore men are the enemy

2417
01:43:01,920 --> 01:43:06,920
and women who date them are gender

2418
01:43:03,800 --> 01:43:09,440
traitors is this argument wrong why is

2419
01:43:06,920 --> 01:43:11,480
it wrong well it's wrong because libido

2420
01:43:09,440 --> 01:43:14,080
laughs in the face of reason you can't

2421
01:43:11,480 --> 01:43:17,159
just reason people into being LGBT

2422
01:43:14,080 --> 01:43:19,280
Sheila I've tried it's not a lifestyle

2423
01:43:17,159 --> 01:43:22,119
Choice Bella I was born this way I can't

2424
01:43:19,280 --> 01:43:24,639
help it so in anticlimax Sheila makes an

2425
01:43:22,119 --> 01:43:26,920
interesting shift she still Advocates

2426
01:43:24,639 --> 01:43:30,040
abolishing heterosexuality but she

2427
01:43:26,920 --> 01:43:32,920
redefines heterosexuality as sexual

2428
01:43:30,040 --> 01:43:35,080
desire that eroticizes power difference

2429
01:43:32,920 --> 01:43:36,840
the reason for the redefinition seems to

2430
01:43:35,080 --> 01:43:39,199
be that instead of feuding with

2431
01:43:36,840 --> 01:43:41,719
heterosexual feminists Sheila is now

2432
01:43:39,199 --> 01:43:44,840
feuding with lesbian stom masochists

2433
01:43:41,719 --> 01:43:47,320
whom she argues are in fact heterosexual

2434
01:43:44,840 --> 01:43:49,800
because they eroticize power and

2435
01:43:47,320 --> 01:43:52,360
eroticizing power includes anything from

2436
01:43:49,800 --> 01:43:54,599
top bottom Dynamics to Kink to

2437
01:43:52,360 --> 01:43:56,920
interracial relationships to good

2438
01:43:54,599 --> 01:43:59,000
old-fashioned penetration so according

2439
01:43:56,920 --> 01:44:02,560
to this view gay men who have

2440
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:04,520
penetrative sex are in fact heterosexual

2441
01:44:02,560 --> 01:44:07,040
because they uphold the oppressive power

2442
01:44:04,520 --> 01:44:09,639
of the phace that subjugates women gay

2443
01:44:07,040 --> 01:44:12,040
women who identify as Butch or fem they

2444
01:44:09,639 --> 01:44:13,920
are heterosexual because they're role

2445
01:44:12,040 --> 01:44:15,760
playing the oppressive dynamics of

2446
01:44:13,920 --> 01:44:18,599
heterosexuality the only true

2447
01:44:15,760 --> 01:44:21,440
homosexuals according to Sheila Jeff are

2448
01:44:18,599 --> 01:44:23,920
couples who eroticize equality so what

2449
01:44:21,440 --> 01:44:26,880
does that mean it means no penetration

2450
01:44:23,920 --> 01:44:28,760
no tops or bottoms no kinky and

2451
01:44:26,880 --> 01:44:31,320
no gender expression apart from the

2452
01:44:28,760 --> 01:44:34,159
androgynous Spock core aesthetic Sheila

2453
01:44:31,320 --> 01:44:36,880
Jeff was rocking so what is left of sex

2454
01:44:34,159 --> 01:44:39,679
when you only eroticize equality well

2455
01:44:36,880 --> 01:44:42,040
egalitarian sex turns out to be two

2456
01:44:39,679 --> 01:44:44,400
ideally non-trans seexual women who are

2457
01:44:42,040 --> 01:44:47,320
the same age race and class with the

2458
01:44:44,400 --> 01:44:50,520
same androgynous haircut lying side by

2459
01:44:47,320 --> 01:44:53,159
side no one on top or bottom just gently

2460
01:44:50,520 --> 01:44:54,880
non- aggressively Whispering sweet words

2461
01:44:53,159 --> 01:44:57,040
of Consciousness raising to each other

2462
01:44:54,880 --> 01:44:59,920
throughout the night Join the Revolution

2463
01:44:57,040 --> 01:45:01,400
the tender loving twinsest Revolution

2464
01:44:59,920 --> 01:45:04,080
you're probably getting very irritated

2465
01:45:01,400 --> 01:45:06,280
listening to this I am also irritated

2466
01:45:04,080 --> 01:45:09,080
but I want to be very clear about why

2467
01:45:06,280 --> 01:45:11,520
I'm irritated I have no problem at all

2468
01:45:09,080 --> 01:45:13,280
with Sheila Jeff's defining sex as

2469
01:45:11,520 --> 01:45:14,960
whatever it means to her a courtesy

2470
01:45:13,280 --> 01:45:16,880
she's never extended to anyone else in

2471
01:45:14,960 --> 01:45:19,520
her entire life but we should extend it

2472
01:45:16,880 --> 01:45:21,440
to her on principle if sex for you means

2473
01:45:19,520 --> 01:45:23,639
tender Consciousness raising sessions

2474
01:45:21,440 --> 01:45:26,679
between the sheets with your andr galp

2475
01:45:23,639 --> 01:45:29,639
Pals by all means continue we should

2476
01:45:26,679 --> 01:45:32,159
also acknowledge that egalitarian sex is

2477
01:45:29,639 --> 01:45:35,000
genuinely marginalized there are ways of

2478
01:45:32,159 --> 01:45:36,880
having sex like you know where both

2479
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:39,159
participants are equally active and

2480
01:45:36,880 --> 01:45:41,719
there's no clear dichotomy of giver and

2481
01:45:39,159 --> 01:45:44,280
receiver mainstream straight and gay

2482
01:45:41,719 --> 01:45:47,800
culture dismisses egalitarian or

2483
01:45:44,280 --> 01:45:51,239
non-penetrative sex as immature as not

2484
01:45:47,800 --> 01:45:53,679
real sex as not going all the way gay

2485
01:45:51,239 --> 01:45:56,320
dating app grinder only added side as a

2486
01:45:53,679 --> 01:45:58,840
selectable position in 2022 the

2487
01:45:56,320 --> 01:46:02,560
unthinkability of egalitarian sex to

2488
01:45:58,840 --> 01:46:05,000
many people shows how deep dhsm goes so

2489
01:46:02,560 --> 01:46:07,840
Sheila Jeff is correct to defend the

2490
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:10,679
legitimacy of egalitarian sex against

2491
01:46:07,840 --> 01:46:12,840
dhsm but again the problem is when you

2492
01:46:10,679 --> 01:46:15,400
declare that your version of egalitarian

2493
01:46:12,840 --> 01:46:17,320
sex is the only legitimate one and that

2494
01:46:15,400 --> 01:46:19,480
everyone else is upholding the

2495
01:46:17,320 --> 01:46:22,159
oppressive system I find this to be a

2496
01:46:19,480 --> 01:46:25,400
deeply lazy incurious and unempathetic

2497
01:46:22,159 --> 01:46:27,320
way of thinking it's unsch this attitude

2498
01:46:25,400 --> 01:46:29,760
of total indifference to what's going on

2499
01:46:27,320 --> 01:46:32,960
in other people's minds why is Sheila

2500
01:46:29,760 --> 01:46:36,159
like this I think it's because she feels

2501
01:46:32,960 --> 01:46:39,040
that she used to be a heterosexual until

2502
01:46:36,159 --> 01:46:40,679
the age of 28 when she made a rational

2503
01:46:39,040 --> 01:46:43,000
conscious choice to become an

2504
01:46:40,679 --> 01:46:45,960
egalitarian androgynous trans

2505
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:48,080
exclusionary non-s masochistic lesbian

2506
01:46:45,960 --> 01:46:50,520
and she thinks that every other woman

2507
01:46:48,080 --> 01:46:52,920
can and should make that choice she says

2508
01:46:50,520 --> 01:46:55,599
in trigger warning quote in the late 19

2509
01:46:52,920 --> 01:46:57,880
7s I rejected heterosexuality and chose

2510
01:46:55,599 --> 01:47:00,360
to become a lesbian Lynn Alderson

2511
01:46:57,880 --> 01:47:02,520
explained to me in patient detail the

2512
01:47:00,360 --> 01:47:04,239
reasons to become a lesbian she

2513
01:47:02,520 --> 01:47:06,199
describes how one evening she was with

2514
01:47:04,239 --> 01:47:08,560
her boyfriend and his guy friend

2515
01:47:06,199 --> 01:47:11,080
watching a TV drama in which a school

2516
01:47:08,560 --> 01:47:12,920
boy put his hand up a teacher's skirt

2517
01:47:11,080 --> 01:47:14,679
quote I looked at the two young men

2518
01:47:12,920 --> 01:47:16,920
beside me neither of whom looked

2519
01:47:14,679 --> 01:47:18,960
particularly affected and then I had an

2520
01:47:16,920 --> 01:47:20,639
epiphany I could not see the point of

2521
01:47:18,960 --> 01:47:22,639
spending time in the company of those

2522
01:47:20,639 --> 01:47:25,320
who were members of the oppressor class

2523
01:47:22,639 --> 01:47:27,159
I chose from that day to the present to

2524
01:47:25,320 --> 01:47:29,400
have only women in my personal and

2525
01:47:27,159 --> 01:47:31,280
emotional life I was suddenly open to

2526
01:47:29,400 --> 01:47:33,400
the feelings I was increasingly having

2527
01:47:31,280 --> 01:47:36,280
towards other women not necessarily

2528
01:47:33,400 --> 01:47:38,599
sexual but profoundly emotional feelings

2529
01:47:36,280 --> 01:47:42,000
so this is the story of how Sheila Jeff

2530
01:47:38,599 --> 01:47:44,320
quit heterosexuality and so can you and

2531
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:46,480
again I'm not saying that Sheila Jeff

2532
01:47:44,320 --> 01:47:49,320
isn't valid or that she's not a real

2533
01:47:46,480 --> 01:47:52,400
lesbian no we're not doing that her

2534
01:47:49,320 --> 01:47:55,000
experience is valid for whatever that's

2535
01:47:52,400 --> 01:47:56,840
worth but it isn't typical most people

2536
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:59,719
do not experience their sexual

2537
01:47:56,840 --> 01:48:02,119
orientation as the result of a rational

2538
01:47:59,719 --> 01:48:03,920
process of consciously deciding the

2539
01:48:02,119 --> 01:48:05,960
correct course of action after

2540
01:48:03,920 --> 01:48:08,280
considering the advice of trusted

2541
01:48:05,960 --> 01:48:10,920
colleagues many heterosexual women

2542
01:48:08,280 --> 01:48:12,880
totally agree with Sheila Jeff that #

2543
01:48:10,920 --> 01:48:15,080
men are trash and they love to say I

2544
01:48:12,880 --> 01:48:17,639
wish I were a lesbian and talk about how

2545
01:48:15,080 --> 01:48:19,880
gross and cringe heterosexuality is and

2546
01:48:17,639 --> 01:48:22,480
yet they continue being straight because

2547
01:48:19,880 --> 01:48:25,599
libido does not follow reason for most

2548
01:48:22,480 --> 01:48:27,639
of us AOS is an Archer we feel

2549
01:48:25,599 --> 01:48:30,840
penetrated by something outside

2550
01:48:27,639 --> 01:48:32,880
ourselves possessed by this alien desire

2551
01:48:30,840 --> 01:48:35,520
I can't help but wonder if what sex

2552
01:48:32,880 --> 01:48:38,159
negative feminists fear in sexuality is

2553
01:48:35,520 --> 01:48:40,560
in fact AOS not just the physical

2554
01:48:38,159 --> 01:48:42,320
penetration of heterosexual intercourse

2555
01:48:40,560 --> 01:48:44,159
but the emotional penetration of

2556
01:48:42,320 --> 01:48:46,199
romantic love and the loss of

2557
01:48:44,159 --> 01:48:48,199
self-possession that comes with it none

2558
01:48:46,199 --> 01:48:51,119
of them belong to themselves anymore and

2559
01:48:48,199 --> 01:48:53,119
the sickest part is the genes tell them

2560
01:48:51,119 --> 01:48:54,760
they're happy about it telling yourself

2561
01:48:53,119 --> 01:48:57,719
that everything you do is because of

2562
01:48:54,760 --> 01:49:00,199
reason and logic soothes the anxiety of

2563
01:48:57,719 --> 01:49:01,840
uncertainty and it disguises the reality

2564
01:49:00,199 --> 01:49:04,280
that none of us really have that much

2565
01:49:01,840 --> 01:49:06,239
control over anything not even our own

2566
01:49:04,280 --> 01:49:08,239
desires and isn't that the point of

2567
01:49:06,239 --> 01:49:10,520
fantasies like Twilight they make it

2568
01:49:08,239 --> 01:49:13,440
feel safe to surrender to this

2569
01:49:10,520 --> 01:49:15,080
frightening overwhelming Force inside us

2570
01:49:13,440 --> 01:49:17,119
I feel like the only reasonable view for

2571
01:49:15,080 --> 01:49:19,960
radical feminists to take is that

2572
01:49:17,119 --> 01:49:21,880
changing Society will change sexuality

2573
01:49:19,960 --> 01:49:23,639
but instead Sheila argues the opposite

2574
01:49:21,880 --> 01:49:26,280
that we should change Society by

2575
01:49:23,639 --> 01:49:28,520
changing sexuality by abolishing it

2576
01:49:26,280 --> 01:49:30,320
Sheila is aware that most people can't

2577
01:49:28,520 --> 01:49:32,920
freely direct their own sexual

2578
01:49:30,320 --> 01:49:35,080
orientation through acts of the will she

2579
01:49:32,920 --> 01:49:37,040
even cites a feminist therapist Who

2580
01:49:35,080 --> 01:49:39,199
quote encouraged her clients to

2581
01:49:37,040 --> 01:49:41,159
democratize their relationships the

2582
01:49:39,199 --> 01:49:43,520
couples kept returning to her with a new

2583
01:49:41,159 --> 01:49:47,239
problem they were unable to summon up

2584
01:49:43,520 --> 01:49:51,199
desire love yes but not desire I think

2585
01:49:47,239 --> 01:49:55,119
many even most people find that equality

2586
01:49:51,199 --> 01:49:58,400
like wisdom is not exciting and Sheila's

2587
01:49:55,119 --> 01:50:00,960
solution for these people is celibacy so

2588
01:49:58,400 --> 01:50:03,360
to recap Sheila thinks that women should

2589
01:50:00,960 --> 01:50:05,679
live in female only communities where no

2590
01:50:03,360 --> 01:50:08,360
one has sex but everyone shares a kind

2591
01:50:05,679 --> 01:50:11,119
of vague homoeroticism and I feel like

2592
01:50:08,360 --> 01:50:13,239
this type of Utopia already exists and

2593
01:50:11,119 --> 01:50:16,199
in fact has existed for hundreds of

2594
01:50:13,239 --> 01:50:18,760
years it's called a Convent doesn't

2595
01:50:16,199 --> 01:50:21,639
Sheila Jeff want to be a nun this is

2596
01:50:18,760 --> 01:50:24,000
where I belong it's my home my family

2597
01:50:21,639 --> 01:50:26,560
it's my life has she reinvented

2598
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:28,119
Christianity well no she's invented

2599
01:50:26,560 --> 01:50:30,159
something worse because at least

2600
01:50:28,119 --> 01:50:32,760
Christianity is honest about the fact

2601
01:50:30,159 --> 01:50:34,840
that our will does not control our lusts

2602
01:50:32,760 --> 01:50:37,280
you have to live the life you were born

2603
01:50:34,840 --> 01:50:39,639
to live in mainstream Christianity the

2604
01:50:37,280 --> 01:50:43,320
idea that we can simply choose to live a

2605
01:50:39,639 --> 01:50:45,719
sinless life is known as pelagian heresy

2606
01:50:43,320 --> 01:50:47,599
this was refuted by Augustine the North

2607
01:50:45,719 --> 01:50:49,719
African Theologian who argued that we

2608
01:50:47,599 --> 01:50:52,239
all have lusted in our heart because we

2609
01:50:49,719 --> 01:50:54,639
are of a fallen nature we inherit the

2610
01:50:52,239 --> 01:50:56,760
sin of of Adam we are stained from birth

2611
01:50:54,639 --> 01:50:58,520
by the filth of concupisent and you

2612
01:50:56,760 --> 01:51:00,800
might say aren't you overthinking

2613
01:50:58,520 --> 01:51:02,599
Twilight no no is the children who are

2614
01:51:00,800 --> 01:51:04,960
underthinking it Augustine's claim is

2615
01:51:02,599 --> 01:51:07,320
that our will can overcome Temptation

2616
01:51:04,960 --> 01:51:10,079
with God's grace but Christians do not

2617
01:51:07,320 --> 01:51:12,320
make the psychologically batshit claim

2618
01:51:10,079 --> 01:51:14,480
that we can consciously direct our lust

2619
01:51:12,320 --> 01:51:16,840
towards virtue sexuality can be

2620
01:51:14,480 --> 01:51:19,079
repressed or resisted or it can be

2621
01:51:16,840 --> 01:51:21,840
sublimated into creative or spiritual

2622
01:51:19,079 --> 01:51:24,520
energy but free will plays very little

2623
01:51:21,840 --> 01:51:26,599
role in either love or lust so Sheila

2624
01:51:24,520 --> 01:51:28,639
Jeff's feminism is actually more

2625
01:51:26,599 --> 01:51:30,639
repressive than Christianity because at

2626
01:51:28,639 --> 01:51:33,400
least in Christianity you get to talk

2627
01:51:30,639 --> 01:51:36,199
about how sinful and wretched you are my

2628
01:51:33,400 --> 01:51:38,599
favorite activity part

2629
01:51:36,199 --> 01:51:40,840
five

2630
01:51:38,599 --> 01:51:43,679
death sometimes late at night I read

2631
01:51:40,840 --> 01:51:46,719
Twilight and I wonder am I prepared for

2632
01:51:43,679 --> 01:51:48,360
death is anyone I've argued that sex

2633
01:51:46,719 --> 01:51:50,960
negative feminists are wrong about

2634
01:51:48,360 --> 01:51:54,840
psychology freedom and fantasy but are

2635
01:51:50,960 --> 01:51:56,760
they wrong about sex well not entirely

2636
01:51:54,840 --> 01:51:59,000
it sounds like an extreme provocation

2637
01:51:56,760 --> 01:52:00,719
when rad fem say things like attached to

2638
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:02,719
all forms of sexual behavior are

2639
01:52:00,719 --> 01:52:04,760
meanings of dominance and submission

2640
01:52:02,719 --> 01:52:06,800
power and powerlessness conquest and

2641
01:52:04,760 --> 01:52:08,599
humiliation but among theorists of

2642
01:52:06,800 --> 01:52:10,480
sexuality across the ideological

2643
01:52:08,599 --> 01:52:12,560
Spectrum there's a surprising amount of

2644
01:52:10,480 --> 01:52:15,520
consensus on this point radical

2645
01:52:12,560 --> 01:52:17,440
feminism's mortal enemy Dr father says

2646
01:52:15,520 --> 01:52:18,840
the history of human civilization shows

2647
01:52:17,440 --> 01:52:20,760
Beyond any doubt that there is an

2648
01:52:18,840 --> 01:52:23,239
intimate connection between cruelty and

2649
01:52:20,760 --> 01:52:27,000
the sexual Instinct sexual

2650
01:52:23,239 --> 01:52:28,840
uh libertarian Camille Pia says All

2651
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:31,119
Phases of procreation are ruled by

2652
01:52:28,840 --> 01:52:33,280
appetite sexual intercourse from kissing

2653
01:52:31,119 --> 01:52:35,000
to penetration consists of movements of

2654
01:52:33,280 --> 01:52:37,159
barely controlled cruelty and

2655
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:39,159
consumption in other words there's a

2656
01:52:37,159 --> 01:52:43,000
pretty wide consensus that human

2657
01:52:39,159 --> 01:52:45,400
sexuality is in fact vampiric that is

2658
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:47,280
it's ruled by hierarchy cruelty and

2659
01:52:45,400 --> 01:52:49,800
consumption the real disagreement is

2660
01:52:47,280 --> 01:52:52,000
about why that is and what we should do

2661
01:52:49,800 --> 01:52:54,440
about it let's address the why question

2662
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:56,520
why is sexuality vampiric the radical

2663
01:52:54,440 --> 01:52:59,280
feminist response is because of

2664
01:52:56,520 --> 01:53:01,320
patriarchy radfems argue satom masochism

2665
01:52:59,280 --> 01:53:03,679
simply mirrors the social reality of

2666
01:53:01,320 --> 01:53:05,719
male Supremacy even when inverted in

2667
01:53:03,679 --> 01:53:08,159
female dominance or when practiced by

2668
01:53:05,719 --> 01:53:10,480
same-sex couples whom redfm say are just

2669
01:53:08,159 --> 01:53:12,520
imitating heterosexuality and sure I

2670
01:53:10,480 --> 01:53:14,880
think patriarchy is largely responsible

2671
01:53:12,520 --> 01:53:17,520
for default male dominance but I think

2672
01:53:14,880 --> 01:53:19,639
satom masochism in general has roots

2673
01:53:17,520 --> 01:53:21,599
deeper than political inequality let's

2674
01:53:19,639 --> 01:53:24,079
start by thinking about why sexuality

2675
01:53:21,599 --> 01:53:25,679
even exists in the first place why can't

2676
01:53:24,079 --> 01:53:28,000
we just be

2677
01:53:25,679 --> 01:53:30,159
normal we can't be normal because we're

2678
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:32,119
not bacteria we can't reproduce by

2679
01:53:30,159 --> 01:53:33,639
mitosis in the scene where Bella and

2680
01:53:32,119 --> 01:53:35,639
Edward are first introduced to each

2681
01:53:33,639 --> 01:53:37,480
other they're in a science lab looking

2682
01:53:35,639 --> 01:53:41,119
through a microscope at the stages of

2683
01:53:37,480 --> 01:53:42,719
mitosis proas metaphase anaphase now you

2684
01:53:41,119 --> 01:53:45,079
could say that's just a coincidence it

2685
01:53:42,719 --> 01:53:46,880
doesn't mean anything okay well maybe

2686
01:53:45,079 --> 01:53:49,280
everything's just a coincidence maybe

2687
01:53:46,880 --> 01:53:52,119
nothing means anything maybe life is

2688
01:53:49,280 --> 01:53:54,119
pointless asexual reproduction is fision

2689
01:53:52,119 --> 01:53:56,119
the cell duplicates its chromosomes and

2690
01:53:54,119 --> 01:53:58,239
rips itself in half creating two

2691
01:53:56,119 --> 01:54:00,719
daughter cells so what happens to the

2692
01:53:58,239 --> 01:54:03,400
Mother cell when it divides is Vision

2693
01:54:00,719 --> 01:54:05,320
death or is it eternal life well it

2694
01:54:03,400 --> 01:54:07,639
depends what we mean by death I promise

2695
01:54:05,320 --> 01:54:09,520
this is about Twilight wait for it death

2696
01:54:07,639 --> 01:54:12,119
is the disillusion of the boundaries

2697
01:54:09,520 --> 01:54:14,119
that Define individual existence each

2698
01:54:12,119 --> 01:54:16,480
individual thing is distinguished from

2699
01:54:14,119 --> 01:54:19,159
other things by its edges the membrane

2700
01:54:16,480 --> 01:54:21,440
of a cell the skin of an animal the

2701
01:54:19,159 --> 01:54:23,840
border of a country in asexual

2702
01:54:21,440 --> 01:54:26,239
reproduction the life of the species

2703
01:54:23,840 --> 01:54:29,360
requires the death of the individual the

2704
01:54:26,239 --> 01:54:31,480
Mother cell must split to reproduce

2705
01:54:29,360 --> 01:54:33,880
sexual reproduction also contains a

2706
01:54:31,480 --> 01:54:36,599
paradox of life and death but instead of

2707
01:54:33,880 --> 01:54:38,719
fision we have fusion and fertilization

2708
01:54:36,599 --> 01:54:41,840
where two gametes merge to create new

2709
01:54:38,719 --> 01:54:44,159
life sexuality also involves Fusion at a

2710
01:54:41,840 --> 01:54:46,840
social and emotional level your partner

2711
01:54:44,159 --> 01:54:49,599
is your other half because in love two

2712
01:54:46,840 --> 01:54:51,639
people become one entity the Bible says

2713
01:54:49,599 --> 01:54:54,639
two married people leave their father

2714
01:54:51,639 --> 01:54:56,840
and mother and become one flesh even if

2715
01:54:54,639 --> 01:54:59,280
they don't biologically reproduce the

2716
01:54:56,840 --> 01:55:01,599
couple is a new social Union that comes

2717
01:54:59,280 --> 01:55:04,320
into being at the expense of their

2718
01:55:01,599 --> 01:55:06,320
former Family Ties and of the boundaries

2719
01:55:04,320 --> 01:55:09,320
that used to define two separate

2720
01:55:06,320 --> 01:55:11,719
individuals so love and sex create new

2721
01:55:09,320 --> 01:55:14,960
life but they also involve a kind of

2722
01:55:11,719 --> 01:55:17,119
death in 1912 the psychoanalyst Sabina

2723
01:55:14,960 --> 01:55:19,440
sheline published a paper called

2724
01:55:17,119 --> 01:55:21,199
destruction as the cause of becoming

2725
01:55:19,440 --> 01:55:23,159
which sent Freud reeling into a thought

2726
01:55:21,199 --> 01:55:25,520
spiral that led him to the theorize the

2727
01:55:23,159 --> 01:55:27,800
Death Drive the question Spiel rine

2728
01:55:25,520 --> 01:55:30,040
wanted to answer is quote why does the

2729
01:55:27,800 --> 01:55:32,239
most powerful Drive the reproductive

2730
01:55:30,040 --> 01:55:34,280
Drive in addition to the expected

2731
01:55:32,239 --> 01:55:37,079
positive feelings Harbor negative

2732
01:55:34,280 --> 01:55:38,840
feelings such as anxiety and disgust

2733
01:55:37,079 --> 01:55:40,880
Spiel rine is trying to explain the

2734
01:55:38,840 --> 01:55:44,400
ambivalence the element of fear and

2735
01:55:40,880 --> 01:55:44,400
trembling in every sexual

2736
01:55:44,560 --> 01:55:49,760
encounter don't be a coward she sees the

2737
01:55:47,400 --> 01:55:51,400
cellular merging of the two gametes this

2738
01:55:49,760 --> 01:55:53,800
creation of new life from the

2739
01:55:51,400 --> 01:55:56,040
destruction of the p parent cells as an

2740
01:55:53,800 --> 01:55:58,639
image representing the emotional

2741
01:55:56,040 --> 01:56:01,079
conflicts of sexuality erotic love is

2742
01:55:58,639 --> 01:56:03,840
always a threat to our sense of self to

2743
01:56:01,079 --> 01:56:07,040
our identity as a distinct individual

2744
01:56:03,840 --> 01:56:07,040
have begun to

2745
01:56:09,960 --> 01:56:15,679
blur it's similar to The Terror and awe

2746
01:56:12,960 --> 01:56:17,960
of mystical experiences encounters with

2747
01:56:15,679 --> 01:56:20,840
God or psychedelic Oneness where you

2748
01:56:17,960 --> 01:56:24,079
both fear and desire losing the edges of

2749
01:56:20,840 --> 01:56:26,560
your ego in s Teresa of aila's mystical

2750
01:56:24,079 --> 01:56:29,000
encounter with the angel she quote saw

2751
01:56:26,560 --> 01:56:30,520
in his hand a long Spear of gold and at

2752
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:32,679
the point there seemed to be a little

2753
01:56:30,520 --> 01:56:35,159
fire he appeared to me to be thrusting

2754
01:56:32,679 --> 01:56:37,880
it at times into my heart and to pierce

2755
01:56:35,159 --> 01:56:40,280
my very entrails when he drew it out he

2756
01:56:37,880 --> 01:56:42,440
seemed to draw them out also and to

2757
01:56:40,280 --> 01:56:44,800
leave me all on fire with a great love

2758
01:56:42,440 --> 01:56:47,440
of God the pain was so great that it

2759
01:56:44,800 --> 01:56:49,599
made me moan and yet so surpassing was

2760
01:56:47,440 --> 01:56:51,560
the sweetness of this excessive pain

2761
01:56:49,599 --> 01:56:53,760
that I could not wish to be rid of it

2762
01:56:51,560 --> 01:56:55,440
now the obvious atheist thing to say is

2763
01:56:53,760 --> 01:56:58,239
that this is just like a repressed

2764
01:56:55,440 --> 01:57:00,440
Renaissance woman getting off on Jesus

2765
01:56:58,239 --> 01:57:03,159
and yes there's obviously a sexual

2766
01:57:00,440 --> 01:57:05,880
element to this but is that all couldn't

2767
01:57:03,159 --> 01:57:08,400
it also be that both mystical and sexual

2768
01:57:05,880 --> 01:57:11,159
experiences penetrate the edges of the

2769
01:57:08,400 --> 01:57:14,639
self blurring the line between self and

2770
01:57:11,159 --> 01:57:16,320
other can be ecstatic or terrifying or

2771
01:57:14,639 --> 01:57:18,560
both it's like when you eat too many

2772
01:57:16,320 --> 01:57:20,880
mushrooms and melt into the Universal

2773
01:57:18,560 --> 01:57:24,040
Mind lattice whenever boundaries become

2774
01:57:20,880 --> 01:57:27,119
unstable a Cris of identity occurs

2775
01:57:24,040 --> 01:57:29,960
xenophobic people experience immigration

2776
01:57:27,119 --> 01:57:33,119
as a violation of the nation's borders

2777
01:57:29,960 --> 01:57:35,960
Build That Wall Build That Wall Build

2778
01:57:33,119 --> 01:57:38,719
That Wall Build That Wall it's a crisis

2779
01:57:35,960 --> 01:57:41,920
of national identity they conceptualize

2780
01:57:38,719 --> 01:57:44,400
as Invasion I think that paranoia about

2781
01:57:41,920 --> 01:57:46,599
vaccines is of a similar type the

2782
01:57:44,400 --> 01:57:49,480
physical boundary of our bodies is our

2783
01:57:46,599 --> 01:57:51,760
skin which is punctured by the

2784
01:57:49,480 --> 01:57:54,400
needle the government is coercing us

2785
01:57:51,760 --> 01:57:57,320
into being being injected penetrated it

2786
01:57:54,400 --> 01:57:59,639
causes deep fears about bodily Integrity

2787
01:57:57,320 --> 01:58:01,719
that people rationalize with conspiracy

2788
01:57:59,639 --> 01:58:05,119
theories for radical feminist Andrea

2789
01:58:01,719 --> 01:58:08,159
dorin intercourse is inherently Invasion

2790
01:58:05,119 --> 01:58:10,560
its occupation its Annihilation dworin

2791
01:58:08,159 --> 01:58:12,679
views penetration as an atrocity

2792
01:58:10,560 --> 01:58:15,079
committed against women by men

2793
01:58:12,679 --> 01:58:17,320
tantamount to colonization and war

2794
01:58:15,079 --> 01:58:19,679
crimes I think she overstates the case

2795
01:58:17,320 --> 01:58:22,000
somewhat is it really Invasion if the

2796
01:58:19,679 --> 01:58:23,440
Invader was invaded in the argument is

2797
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:25,880
that that women are coerced into

2798
01:58:23,440 --> 01:58:28,159
consenting that no woman would consent

2799
01:58:25,880 --> 01:58:29,880
to intercourse without coercion and you

2800
01:58:28,159 --> 01:58:32,520
can decide for yourself if you find that

2801
01:58:29,880 --> 01:58:34,079
owering or extremely condescending I

2802
01:58:32,520 --> 01:58:37,239
think penetration can be

2803
01:58:34,079 --> 01:58:39,599
reconceptualized as giving as offering

2804
01:58:37,239 --> 01:58:41,719
as an act of service but let's be honest

2805
01:58:39,599 --> 01:58:44,480
most of the time penetration is

2806
01:58:41,719 --> 01:58:44,480
associated with

2807
01:58:45,760 --> 01:58:51,159
dominance don't men have sexual paranoia

2808
01:58:48,719 --> 01:58:54,920
of their own in Romance men fear

2809
01:58:51,159 --> 01:58:57,599
viscosity the overly attached

2810
01:58:54,920 --> 01:59:01,079
girlfriend in sex men sometimes fear

2811
01:58:57,599 --> 01:59:03,280
engulfment devouring castration losing

2812
01:59:01,079 --> 01:59:06,800
part of themselves and the wom their

2813
01:59:03,280 --> 01:59:09,719
precious bodily fluids women sense my

2814
01:59:06,800 --> 01:59:12,280
power and they seek the life Essence not

2815
01:59:09,719 --> 01:59:14,360
all fears are equally valid I do think

2816
01:59:12,280 --> 01:59:16,719
the penetrated partner is made more

2817
01:59:14,360 --> 01:59:19,000
vulnerable in most cases if I may

2818
01:59:16,719 --> 01:59:21,840
adjudicate as the tyresius in this

2819
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:23,800
debate in both penetration and devouring

2820
01:59:21,840 --> 01:59:26,639
the boundaries between people are

2821
01:59:23,800 --> 01:59:28,360
violated violation may be fundamental to

2822
01:59:26,639 --> 01:59:30,920
sexuality even when there is no

2823
01:59:28,360 --> 01:59:33,119
penetration Freud's partial drives oral

2824
01:59:30,920 --> 01:59:35,800
anal and phallic all involve the

2825
01:59:33,119 --> 01:59:37,760
movement of a substance into or out of

2826
01:59:35,800 --> 01:59:40,159
the body simply the act of stripping

2827
01:59:37,760 --> 01:59:43,000
naked destroys a boundary and at the

2828
01:59:40,159 --> 01:59:46,239
interior emotional level desire is a

2829
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:49,119
wound subjectively desire feels

2830
01:59:46,239 --> 01:59:52,719
violating and Carson says when I desire

2831
01:59:49,119 --> 01:59:54,960
you a part of me is gone your lack is my

2832
01:59:52,719 --> 01:59:57,760
lack I would not be in want of you

2833
01:59:54,960 --> 02:00:00,280
unless you had partaken of me the lover

2834
01:59:57,760 --> 02:00:03,000
reasons a hole is being gnawed in my

2835
02:00:00,280 --> 02:00:05,280
vitals says safo theocritus says you

2836
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:08,040
have sucked my blood this is why

2837
02:00:05,280 --> 02:00:10,679
vampirism is a metaphor for sexuality in

2838
02:00:08,040 --> 02:00:12,760
Twilight and in most vampire media in

2839
02:00:10,679 --> 02:00:15,040
Midnight Sun we learn what Edward is

2840
02:00:12,760 --> 02:00:17,119
thinking next to Bella in biology

2841
02:00:15,040 --> 02:00:19,679
holding his breath to avoid quote

2842
02:00:17,119 --> 02:00:23,040
sinking my teeth through that fine thin

2843
02:00:19,679 --> 02:00:25,159
see-through skin to the heart wet

2844
02:00:23,040 --> 02:00:27,760
pulsing there's a reason my books have a

2845
02:00:25,159 --> 02:00:30,719
lot of Innocence masculine and feminine

2846
02:00:27,760 --> 02:00:33,440
sexual hazards are Blended in Vampires

2847
02:00:30,719 --> 02:00:35,360
who both penetrate you and devour your

2848
02:00:33,440 --> 02:00:38,320
precious bodily fluids they have an

2849
02:00:35,360 --> 02:00:41,560
androgynous appeal both male and female

2850
02:00:38,320 --> 02:00:43,719
vampires are capable of penetrating and

2851
02:00:41,560 --> 02:00:46,760
capable of sucking it's probably one

2852
02:00:43,719 --> 02:00:49,040
reason there's so many LGBT vampires and

2853
02:00:46,760 --> 02:00:52,159
lesbian vampires in particular the

2854
02:00:49,040 --> 02:00:54,119
lesbian vampire is an oral stist for

2855
02:00:52,159 --> 02:00:56,440
Freud the oral stage is quote

2856
02:00:54,119 --> 02:00:58,719
cannibalistic pregenital sexual

2857
02:00:56,440 --> 02:01:00,280
organization here sexual activity has

2858
02:00:58,719 --> 02:01:02,840
not yet been separated from the

2859
02:01:00,280 --> 02:01:05,119
ingestion of food the sexual aim

2860
02:01:02,840 --> 02:01:07,800
consists in the incorporation of the

2861
02:01:05,119 --> 02:01:09,920
object adult sexuality develops out of

2862
02:01:07,800 --> 02:01:11,920
infantile Roots beginning with the

2863
02:01:09,920 --> 02:01:14,280
hunger of her mommy's milk Freud

2864
02:01:11,920 --> 02:01:17,400
considers it an infantile regression but

2865
02:01:14,280 --> 02:01:20,320
I for one stand by the oral stage I

2866
02:01:17,400 --> 02:01:20,320
think it's a fine

2867
02:01:20,400 --> 02:01:25,599
stage BS are are little vampires they

2868
02:01:23,159 --> 02:01:28,679
drink sustenance from what they love

2869
02:01:25,599 --> 02:01:31,199
vampirism is a subgenre of cannibalism

2870
02:01:28,679 --> 02:01:34,280
and cannibalism is usually connected in

2871
02:01:31,199 --> 02:01:37,040
some way with the urge to merge I don't

2872
02:01:34,280 --> 02:01:41,040
even know where you end and I begin

2873
02:01:37,040 --> 02:01:43,280
Reddit user Susi MIM bavan explains the

2874
02:01:41,040 --> 02:01:45,320
thing about Vore that appeals to me is

2875
02:01:43,280 --> 02:01:47,159
the closeness and intimacy between the

2876
02:01:45,320 --> 02:01:49,719
two parties involved I mean it's

2877
02:01:47,159 --> 02:01:51,560
literally letting someone inside you in

2878
02:01:49,719 --> 02:01:54,639
a weird and Abstract way it's really

2879
02:01:51,560 --> 02:01:57,719
cute think of it like cuddling taken to

2880
02:01:54,639 --> 02:02:00,800
the extreme aw these are not realistic

2881
02:01:57,719 --> 02:02:03,280
cannibal fantasies most people into Vore

2882
02:02:00,800 --> 02:02:05,040
have no interest in literally consuming

2883
02:02:03,280 --> 02:02:07,079
human flesh but of course there's always

2884
02:02:05,040 --> 02:02:09,480
that one in a million psycho who takes

2885
02:02:07,079 --> 02:02:11,639
things too far and ruins it for everyone

2886
02:02:09,480 --> 02:02:13,800
cannibal lust killer Jeffrey dmer claims

2887
02:02:11,639 --> 02:02:15,960
he elected victims based on physical

2888
02:02:13,800 --> 02:02:17,480
Beauty killing and eating them quote not

2889
02:02:15,960 --> 02:02:19,480
because I was angry with them not

2890
02:02:17,480 --> 02:02:22,320
because I hated them but because I

2891
02:02:19,480 --> 02:02:25,360
wanted to keep them with me possess them

2892
02:02:22,320 --> 02:02:28,639
permanently it was a way of uh making me

2893
02:02:25,360 --> 02:02:30,840
feel that uh they were a part of me male

2894
02:02:28,639 --> 02:02:33,960
serial killers they don't even make use

2895
02:02:30,840 --> 02:02:36,639
of the skin even dmer outlandish crimes

2896
02:02:33,960 --> 02:02:39,119
are just a morally deranged enactment of

2897
02:02:36,639 --> 02:02:42,560

symbolically related in the western

book is even more graphic Bella is

2964
02:05:26,520 --> 02:05:31,520
vomiting blood it's nauseating to read

2965
02:05:29,320 --> 02:05:33,960
Edward saves Bella by injecting his

2966
02:05:31,520 --> 02:05:36,320
Venom and doing chest compressions which

2967
02:05:33,960 --> 02:05:38,559
begins her excruciating transformation

2968
02:05:36,320 --> 02:05:40,639
quote I wanted to raise my arms and Claw

2969
02:05:38,559 --> 02:05:42,760
my chest open and rip my heart from it

2970
02:05:40,639 --> 02:05:45,840
anything to get rid of this torture so

2971
02:05:42,760 --> 02:05:49,280
she suffers for 3 Days on the slab after

2972
02:05:45,840 --> 02:05:50,880
which she Rises reborn as a vampire can

2973
02:05:49,280 --> 02:05:52,960
you think of anyone else who died in

2974
02:05:50,880 --> 02:05:55,679
agony only to to be resurrected 3 days

2975
02:05:52,960 --> 02:05:58,079
later I'm coming up blank I got nothing

2976
02:05:55,679 --> 02:06:00,239
for Stephanie Meyer child birth is

2977
02:05:58,079 --> 02:06:02,320
crucifixion it's death that gives

2978
02:06:00,239 --> 02:06:04,599
eternal life and if Twilight makes it

2979
02:06:02,320 --> 02:06:06,960
explicit some of the satom masochistic

2980
02:06:04,599 --> 02:06:09,000
subtext of Christianity 50 Shades of

like Bella is Jesus in childbirth we're

2987
02:06:25,400 --> 02:06:31,639
meant to understand that this is sacred

2988
02:06:27,719 --> 02:06:33,719

2989
02:06:31,639 --> 02:06:38,210

2993
02:06:44,440 --> 02:06:49,760
either way my argument has a lot of

2994
02:06:47,440 --> 02:06:52,199
biblical support in the Book of Genesis

2995
02:06:49,760 --> 02:06:54,520
God creates the sex binary through the

2996
02:06:52,199 --> 02:06:57,000
violence of vision he takes the rib out

2997
02:06:54,520 --> 02:07:00,360
of Adam and makes Eve Adam calls her

2998
02:06:57,000 --> 02:07:02,920
Flesh of My Flesh bone of my bones then

2999
02:07:00,360 --> 02:07:05,239
in marriage the two Sexes become one

3000
02:07:02,920 --> 02:07:08,079
flesh again through the violence of

3001
02:07:05,239 --> 02:07:10,159
fusion can we talk about the sanctity of

3002
02:07:08,079 --> 02:07:11,559
sex and violence I promise this is about

3003
02:07:10,159 --> 02:07:13,440
Twilight okay I'm not going to go off on

3004
02:07:11,559 --> 02:07:16,719
some wild tangent in a video about

3005
02:07:13,440 --> 02:07:19,000
Twilight like eroticism sanctity is a

3006
02:07:16,719 --> 02:07:21,239
matter of boundaries the sacred is

3007
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:23,040
contrasted with the profane the word

3008
02:07:21,239 --> 02:07:25,599
profan profane comes from the Latin

3009
02:07:23,040 --> 02:07:27,800
profanum meaning before the temple

3010
02:07:25,599 --> 02:07:30,079
outside the temple so the sacred is

3011
02:07:27,800 --> 02:07:33,040
what's in the temple it's what's set

3012
02:07:30,079 --> 02:07:35,719
apart as close to God or Gods religion

3013
02:07:33,040 --> 02:07:37,719
and ritual impose order on the world

3014
02:07:35,719 --> 02:07:39,920
creating distinctions between the sacred

3015
02:07:37,719 --> 02:07:42,239
and the profane it sounds weird to say

3016
02:07:39,920 --> 02:07:44,079
that sex and violence are sacred because

3017
02:07:42,239 --> 02:07:45,599
aren't sex and violence the number one

3018
02:07:44,079 --> 02:07:49,880
things that religious people are always

3019
02:07:45,599 --> 02:07:52,760
whining about well yes and no God said

3020
02:07:49,880 --> 02:07:54,559
to Moses Thou shalt not kill a simple

3021
02:07:52,760 --> 02:07:57,320
commandment the sort of thing you can

3022
02:07:54,559 --> 02:08:00,040
carve in stone nevertheless Deuteronomy

3023
02:07:57,320 --> 02:08:01,800
2016 says in the cities of the Nations

3024
02:08:00,040 --> 02:08:04,199
the Lord your God is giving you as an

3025
02:08:01,800 --> 02:08:06,520
inheritance do not leave alive anything

3026
02:08:04,199 --> 02:08:08,360
that breathes completely destroy them

3027
02:08:06,520 --> 02:08:12,040
the Hittites and the amorites and the

3028
02:08:08,360 --> 02:08:14,400
Canaanites and the and as the Lord your

3029
02:08:12,040 --> 02:08:18,440
God has commanded you well that sounds

3030
02:08:14,400 --> 02:08:20,000
an awful lot like killing to me a ding I

3031
02:08:18,440 --> 02:08:21,520
mean it's only the book of Deuteronomy

3032
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:24,360
and we're already wiping out entire

3033
02:08:21,520 --> 02:08:26,639
cities kill everyone now so maybe the

3034
02:08:24,360 --> 02:08:29,719
Commandment Thou shalt not kill only

3035
02:08:26,639 --> 02:08:31,520
means don't kill Israelites in fact that

3036
02:08:29,719 --> 02:08:35,199
is what it means the Canaanites don't

3037
02:08:31,520 --> 02:08:37,679
have a covenant with God so them

3038
02:08:35,199 --> 02:08:40,360
condone first degree murder The Killing

3039
02:08:37,679 --> 02:08:42,320
Israelites is not entirely off the table

3040
02:08:40,360 --> 02:08:43,599
either for example according to

3041
02:08:42,320 --> 02:08:46,840
Leviticus

3042
02:08:43,599 --> 02:08:49,159
2013 say it with me if a Man Lies with a

3043
02:08:46,840 --> 02:08:51,040
male as with a woman both of them have

3044
02:08:49,159 --> 02:08:54,040
committed an Abomination they shall

3045
02:08:51,040 --> 02:08:57,239
surely be un alived

3046
02:08:54,040 --> 02:09:00,719
y okay so no killing except the

3047
02:08:57,239 --> 02:09:02,880
Canaanites and the gays the exceptions

3048
02:09:00,719 --> 02:09:05,520
are stocking so the Commandment isn't

3049
02:09:02,880 --> 02:09:09,520
really Thou shalt not kill it's Thou

3050
02:09:05,520 --> 02:09:12,159
shalt not kill unless likewise Leviticus

3051
02:09:09,520 --> 02:09:14,639
17 seems to prohibit the slaughter of

3052
02:09:12,159 --> 02:09:17,239
animals unless you kill them

3053
02:09:14,639 --> 02:09:19,040
sacrificially at the Tabernacle in the

3054
02:09:17,239 --> 02:09:21,360
Sacred Space you know Christians tend

3055
02:09:19,040 --> 02:09:23,199
not to read Leviticus but I do because I

3056
02:09:21,360 --> 02:09:25,320
enjoy violence and I hate myself

3057
02:09:23,199 --> 02:09:27,559
Leviticus is also important context for

3058
02:09:25,320 --> 02:09:29,840
the entire story of Christianity Jesus

3059
02:09:27,559 --> 02:09:32,079
is the Lamb of God that taketh away the

3060
02:09:29,840 --> 02:09:34,040
sins of the world what does that mean

3061
02:09:32,079 --> 02:09:36,440
what does that mean it doesn't make any

3062
02:09:34,040 --> 02:09:38,559
sense unless you're familiar with

3063
02:09:36,440 --> 02:09:41,360
Leviticus and you understand that

3064
02:09:38,559 --> 02:09:44,239
killing a lamb is a ritual of atonement

3065
02:09:41,360 --> 02:09:46,800
is a ritual of atonement the Tabernacle

3066
02:09:44,239 --> 02:09:49,119
of Moses was like a godamn Chanty Town

slaughter house the sacred barbecue

3068
02:09:49,119 --> 02:09:52,520
sorry I'm doing a lot of blasphemies but

3069
02:09:50,840 --> 02:09:54,559
frankly I think God is bored with you

3070
02:09:52,520 --> 02:09:56,400
people I think he enjoys my Innovative

3071
02:09:54,559 --> 02:09:58,119
interpretations a lamb had to be

3072
02:09:56,400 --> 02:10:00,159
sacrificed every morning and every

3073
02:09:58,119 --> 02:10:02,520
evening in addition to all the sin and

3074
02:10:00,159 --> 02:10:04,320
guilt sacrifices when Solomon dedicated

3075
02:10:02,520 --> 02:10:06,840

3076
02:10:04,320 --> 02:10:09,920
22,000 oxen and

3077
02:10:06,840 --> 02:10:11,800
120,000 sheep imagine the blood imagine

3078
02:10:09,920 --> 02:10:13,639
the blood the elevator in The Shining

3079
02:10:11,800 --> 02:10:15,840
doesn't even come close we can't talk

3080
02:10:13,639 --> 02:10:17,960
about vampire romance without

3081
02:10:15,840 --> 02:10:20,360
understanding the symbolism of blood a

3082
02:10:17,960 --> 02:10:23,360
paradox in Leviticus is that blood is

3083
02:10:20,360 --> 02:10:25,760
both cleansing and unclean we're told

3084
02:10:23,360 --> 02:10:28,320
that menstruating women are unclean a

3085
02:10:25,760 --> 02:10:31,119
woman who gives birth is unclean eating

3086
02:10:28,320 --> 02:10:33,280
blood is forbidden sorry Vamps but when

3087
02:10:31,119 --> 02:10:35,400
a woman has been made unclean through

3088
02:10:33,280 --> 02:10:37,880
the blood of irregular menstruation or

3089
02:10:35,400 --> 02:10:41,079
childbirth how does she atone and become

3090
02:10:37,880 --> 02:10:43,679
clean again well by sacrificing an

3091
02:10:41,079 --> 02:10:44,760
animal and spilling its blood and people

3092
02:10:43,679 --> 02:10:46,880
have been trying to understand this

3093
02:10:44,760 --> 02:10:48,400
Paradox for thousands of years I'm not

3094
02:10:46,880 --> 02:10:49,920
going to pretend that I have it all

3095
02:10:48,400 --> 02:10:51,880
figured out but I feel like it has

3096
02:10:49,920 --> 02:10:54,960
something to do with blood representing

3097
02:10:51,880 --> 02:10:57,800
a transition between life and death

3098
02:10:54,960 --> 02:10:59,800
Leviticus 17 forbids eating blood

3099
02:10:57,800 --> 02:11:03,079
because the life of every creature is

3100
02:10:59,800 --> 02:11:05,520
its blood its blood is its life when is

3101
02:11:03,079 --> 02:11:08,360
blood spilled when a child is born

3102
02:11:05,520 --> 02:11:12,320
beginning life and when a lamb's throat

3103
02:11:08,360 --> 02:11:16,360
is cut ending life what a stupid lamb

3104
02:11:12,320 --> 02:11:16,360
could we say that blood is

3105
02:11:17,280 --> 02:11:23,440
Lial it's super it's Lial it's uncanny

3106
02:11:21,079 --> 02:11:25,800
it's object another explanation comes

3107
02:11:23,440 --> 02:11:27,880
from George Bai who argues quote

3108
02:11:25,800 --> 02:11:30,199
whatever is the subject of a Prohibition

3109
02:11:27,880 --> 02:11:32,800
is basically sacred the sacred World

3110
02:11:30,199 --> 02:11:35,199
depends on limited acts of transgression

3111
02:11:32,800 --> 02:11:38,679
so all societies have taboos usually

3112
02:11:35,199 --> 02:11:41,880
governing food sex reproduction blood

3113
02:11:38,679 --> 02:11:43,920
violence dead bodies you know the good

3114
02:11:41,880 --> 02:11:47,040
stuff but Tai's argument is that every

3115
02:11:43,920 --> 02:11:49,320
taboo has exceptions paradoxically

3116
02:11:47,040 --> 02:11:51,760
permitted transgressions and those

3117
02:11:49,320 --> 02:11:56,000
permitted transgressions simply are the

3118
02:11:51,760 --> 02:11:59,800
sacred Thou shalt not kill unless the

3119
02:11:56,000 --> 02:12:02,159
unless is the permitted transgression is

3120
02:11:59,800 --> 02:12:04,480
the sacred the Commandment Thou shalt

3121
02:12:02,159 --> 02:12:09,000
not commit adultery could be rephrased

3122
02:12:04,480 --> 02:12:10,480
as Thou shalt not have sex unless unless

3123
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:13,239
it's with the person who you're married

3124
02:12:10,480 --> 02:12:15,520
to for the purpose of procreation or

3125
02:12:13,239 --> 02:12:17,639
whatever it is you people do sex is

3126
02:12:15,520 --> 02:12:20,760
probably taboo for the same reason that

3127
02:12:17,639 --> 02:12:22,639
killing is Rene girad says sexuality is

3128
02:12:20,760 --> 02:12:25,880
impure or because it has to do with

3129
02:12:22,639 --> 02:12:29,159
violence unregulated sex leads to abuse

3130
02:12:25,880 --> 02:12:31,679
seduction assault disease parentless

3131
02:12:29,159 --> 02:12:34,679
children defenseless women cheating

3132
02:12:31,679 --> 02:12:36,480
jealousy rivalry literally the Trojan

3133
02:12:34,679 --> 02:12:38,000
War and we could argue about how

3134
02:12:36,480 --> 02:12:40,440
effective marriage really is at

3135
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:43,400
preventing those things but in theory

3136
02:12:40,440 --> 02:12:45,559
sex like killing has to be contained

3137
02:12:43,400 --> 02:12:48,000
within the boundaries of the Sacred in

3138
02:12:45,559 --> 02:12:50,520
this case marriage batai says the

3139
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:53,360
initial sexual act constituting marriage

3140
02:12:50,520 --> 02:12:56,559
is a permiss violation if sacrifice is

3141
02:12:53,360 --> 02:12:59,360
sacred Slaughter then marriage is sacred

3142
02:12:56,559 --> 02:13:02,040
sex I wonder if a wedding is also a kind

3143
02:12:59,360 --> 02:13:04,239
of sacrifice it takes place on an altar

3144
02:13:02,040 --> 02:13:07,159
usually where sacrifices happen who's

3145
02:13:04,239 --> 02:13:09,559
the sacrificial lamb well I assume the

3146
02:13:07,159 --> 02:13:12,040
bride she's the Virgin on the altar at

3147
02:13:09,559 --> 02:13:14,520
least the symbolic version Twilight uses

3148
02:13:12,040 --> 02:13:17,520
evocative imagery of red splashed all

3149
02:13:14,520 --> 02:13:19,760
over white Purity and blood life and

3150
02:13:17,520 --> 02:13:22,280
death people say your wedding is your

3151
02:13:19,760 --> 02:13:25,679
first funeral the bride is going to die

3152
02:13:22,280 --> 02:13:28,360
to beget life that makes her sacrificial

3153
02:13:25,679 --> 02:13:31,639
Christlike a wedding is a ritualized

3154
02:13:28,360 --> 02:13:33,440
transgression of the usual taboo on sex

3155
02:13:31,639 --> 02:13:35,639
and these dynamics of taboo and

3156
02:13:33,440 --> 02:13:38,320
transgression make human sex and

3157
02:13:35,639 --> 02:13:41,239
violence fundamentally different from

3158
02:13:38,320 --> 02:13:43,719
natural animal sex and violence I think

3159
02:13:41,239 --> 02:13:46,079
it's wrong to conclude as Paul Shephard

3160
02:13:43,719 --> 02:13:48,760
does that quote there is a danger in all

3161
02:13:46,079 --> 02:13:51,119
carnivores including humans of confusing

3162
02:13:48,760 --> 02:13:53,440
the two kinds of venial aggression

3163
02:13:51,119 --> 02:13:56,079
loving and hunting human sexual

3164
02:13:53,440 --> 02:13:58,639
aggression is not like animal predation

3165
02:13:56,079 --> 02:14:00,679
it's conceptual rather than instinctive

3166
02:13:58,639 --> 02:14:02,920
Bai says quote the object some

3167
02:14:00,679 --> 02:14:06,159
undiscriminating animal is after is not

3168
02:14:02,920 --> 02:14:08,639
what is desired the object is forbidden

3169
02:14:06,159 --> 02:14:10,880
sacred and the Very prohibition attached

3170
02:14:08,639 --> 02:14:13,960
to it is what arouses the desire the

3171
02:14:10,880 --> 02:14:16,440
idea that the taboo creates the desire

3172
02:14:13,960 --> 02:14:19,199
explains the element of profanation in

3173
02:14:16,440 --> 02:14:21,440
sadistic fantasy the word sadism is

3174
02:14:19,199 --> 02:14:24,840
named after 18th century French author

3175
02:14:21,440 --> 02:14:27,280
and sex criminal the Marquee dad dad was

3176
02:14:24,840 --> 02:14:29,639
convicted on charges of debauchery and

3177
02:14:27,280 --> 02:14:32,520
IM moderate libertinage and imprison in

3178
02:14:29,639 --> 02:14:35,480
the best steal where he wrote 120 days

3179
02:14:32,520 --> 02:14:38,599
of Sodom a heartwarming classic beloved

3180
02:14:35,480 --> 02:14:41,480
to this day by children of all ages

3181
02:14:38,599 --> 02:14:44,159
debauchery and IM moderate libertin age

3182
02:14:41,480 --> 02:14:46,440
sounds very quaint very Charming but

3183
02:14:44,159 --> 02:14:48,520
let's be clear dad was drugging and

3184
02:14:46,440 --> 02:14:51,440
abusing sex workers he tortured some

3185
02:14:48,520 --> 02:14:53,880
folks we tortured some folks jenz is

3186
02:14:51,440 --> 02:14:56,880
canceling the Marquee dad is nothing

3187
02:14:53,880 --> 02:14:58,840
sacred 120 days of Sodom I don't know if

3188
02:14:56,880 --> 02:15:01,040
I can accurately summarize this book and

3189
02:14:58,840 --> 02:15:05,480
a way that's even allowed on YouTube

3190
02:15:01,040 --> 02:15:08,280
I'll try um four wealthy Libertines

3191
02:15:05,480 --> 02:15:11,280
imprison a group of youths in a castle

3192
02:15:08,280 --> 02:15:13,880
where old prostitutes tell stories of

3193
02:15:11,280 --> 02:15:16,320
every conceivable blasphemy crime and

3194
02:15:13,880 --> 02:15:18,239
perversion and you did it at my birthday

3195
02:15:16,320 --> 02:15:22,480
dinner then the whole thing escalates

3196
02:15:18,239 --> 02:15:24,880
into an orgy of you know rape and un

3197
02:15:22,480 --> 02:15:26,520
alement still a better love story than

3198
02:15:24,880 --> 02:15:28,559
I'm bringing this up because doad

3199
02:15:26,520 --> 02:15:31,800
illustrates bai's point that the

3200
02:15:28,559 --> 02:15:34,480
transgressive is desired because it is

3201
02:15:31,800 --> 02:15:38,040
forbidden personally I don't find sod's

3202
02:15:34,480 --> 02:15:40,119
work sexy if anything it's funny like in

3203
02:15:38,040 --> 02:15:42,880
the way that John Waters is funny

3204
02:15:40,119 --> 02:15:45,440
Advocate cannibalism eat because

3205
02:15:42,880 --> 02:15:47,719
comedy like sexuality relies on

3206
02:15:45,440 --> 02:15:52,480
transgression the things described in

3207
02:15:47,719 --> 02:15:54,760
120 days of Sodom like bodily fluids are

3208
02:15:52,480 --> 02:15:57,960
excreted on a crucifix which is then

3209
02:15:54,760 --> 02:16:00,679
deployed in unspeakable acts of oh my

3210
02:15:57,960 --> 02:16:03,280
God this is not Natural Animal

3211
02:16:00,679 --> 02:16:07,079
aggression when sod's Champion Camille

3212
02:16:03,280 --> 02:16:09,599
Pia says Nature's reality is sodian red

3213
02:16:07,079 --> 02:16:11,599
in tooth and Claw this is a misuse of

3214
02:16:09,599 --> 02:16:15,119
sod's name because there's nothing

3215
02:16:11,599 --> 02:16:17,639
natural about 120 days of Sodom there is

3216
02:16:15,119 --> 02:16:20,040
aggression in nature dolphins for

3217
02:16:17,639 --> 02:16:21,559
example are sexually violent don't

3218
02:16:20,040 --> 02:16:23,520
Google it you you don't need this in

3219
02:16:21,559 --> 02:16:26,559
your brain but dolphins do not commit

3220
02:16:23,520 --> 02:16:29,199
sex crimes because dolphins do not have

3221
02:16:26,559 --> 02:16:32,399
laws in the criminal justice system

3222
02:16:29,199 --> 02:16:34,519
sexually based offenses are considered

3223
02:16:32,399 --> 02:16:37,800
especially no

3224
02:16:34,519 --> 02:16:40,519
accusations friendly only human violence

3225
02:16:37,800 --> 02:16:43,319
is ritualized it always stands in some

3226
02:16:40,519 --> 02:16:46,120
relation to Taboo whether it's sacred

3227
02:16:43,319 --> 02:16:48,519
permitted transgression or profane

3228
02:16:46,120 --> 02:16:50,920
criminal transgression Jeffrey dmer

3229
02:16:48,519 --> 02:16:53,240
sketched a diagram of a shrine he was

3230
02:16:50,920 --> 02:16:56,080
planning to create an altar on which to

3231
02:16:53,240 --> 02:16:58,880
display his victim's skulls this is not

3232
02:16:56,080 --> 02:17:01,679
animal predation Lions do not build

3233
02:16:58,880 --> 02:17:04,280
shrines for the skulls of the Lambs the

3234
02:17:01,679 --> 02:17:06,920
element of blasphemy and disad is the

3235
02:17:04,280 --> 02:17:10,319
most telling in sadistic fantasy the

3236
02:17:06,920 --> 02:17:13,479
sacred is invoked so it can be profaned

3237
02:17:10,319 --> 02:17:15,679
Bai says quote beauty is desired in

3238
02:17:13,479 --> 02:17:18,359
order that it may be befouled the

3239
02:17:15,679 --> 02:17:20,920
polluting or despoiling of beauty is a

3240
02:17:18,359 --> 02:17:23,519
major theme in male oriented smut fil

3241
02:17:20,920 --> 02:17:26,960
FMS there's a lot of fluids being you

3242
02:17:23,519 --> 02:17:29,280
know blasted everywhere I think this is

3243
02:17:26,960 --> 02:17:31,120
a real point of conflict within

3244
02:17:29,280 --> 02:17:33,840
heterosexuality a lot of women want to

3245
02:17:31,120 --> 02:17:36,719
be intensely desired by men a lot of

3246
02:17:33,840 --> 02:17:40,000
women fantasize about being virtuosic

3247
02:17:36,719 --> 02:17:43,599
ravished by men but far fewer women

3248
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:45,559
Swoon at the prospect of being befouled

3249
02:17:43,599 --> 02:17:47,639
I mean some women do right for anything

3250
02:17:45,559 --> 02:17:49,359
you can think of there's someone who's

3251
02:17:47,639 --> 02:17:52,519
into it but feminine submissive

3252
02:17:49,359 --> 02:17:54,880
fantasies if anything tend to sanctify

3253
02:17:52,519 --> 02:17:57,479
sexuality before it was called 50 Shades

3254
02:17:54,880 --> 02:18:00,359
of Gray This Twilight fanfiction was

3255
02:17:57,479 --> 02:18:02,599
titled Master of the Universe master of

3256
02:18:00,359 --> 02:18:06,160
the universe is not what you call a man

3257
02:18:02,599 --> 02:18:07,760
it's what you call a god what if God was

3258
02:18:06,160 --> 02:18:11,319
one of

3259
02:18:07,760 --> 02:18:14,319
us by submitting to a Godlike man the

3260
02:18:11,319 --> 02:18:17,399
masochistic woman elevates herself

3261
02:18:14,319 --> 02:18:20,040
whereas a sadistic man elevates himself

3262
02:18:17,399 --> 02:18:22,559
by putting down a woman masculine

3263
02:18:20,040 --> 02:18:25,559
sadistic fantasy usually involves

3264
02:18:22,559 --> 02:18:27,679
degradation and despoiling of the woman

3265
02:18:25,559 --> 02:18:30,559
her beauty is a sacred Temple that he

3266
02:18:27,679 --> 02:18:33,519
profanes with his in this case not so

3267
02:18:30,559 --> 02:18:35,399
precious bodily fluids we want to drench

3268
02:18:33,519 --> 02:18:38,599
your angel wings that carry you to

3269
02:18:35,399 --> 02:18:41,439
heaven with our sticky gooey disgusting

3270
02:18:38,599 --> 02:18:43,920
so in a way sism and masochism are in

3271
02:18:41,439 --> 02:18:46,359
fact not complimentary at all the

3272
02:18:43,920 --> 02:18:48,479
philosopher delus recounts a joke that

3273
02:18:46,359 --> 02:18:51,920
tells of the meeting between a sist and

3274
02:18:48,479 --> 02:18:55,760
a masochist the masochist says hurt me

3275
02:18:51,920 --> 02:18:59,280
the sadist replies no Christian Gray is

3276
02:18:55,760 --> 02:19:01,719
not as he claims a SST I get off and

3277
02:18:59,280 --> 02:19:04,080
punishing women women who look like you

3278
02:19:01,719 --> 02:19:07,280
like your mother he's a masochist

3279
02:19:04,080 --> 02:19:09,920
fantasy of a sadist in reality a SST and

3280
02:19:07,280 --> 02:19:12,920
a masochist do not belong together the

3281
02:19:09,920 --> 02:19:15,519
ideal pairing is probably two masochists

3282
02:19:12,920 --> 02:19:17,920
who alternate taking the AC of role in

3283
02:19:15,519 --> 02:19:20,120
masochistic play acting you know what

3284
02:19:17,920 --> 02:19:22,399
maybe we should abolish heterosexuality

3285
02:19:20,120 --> 02:19:24,359
I'm sorry sh sha Jeff you were right

3286
02:19:22,399 --> 02:19:28,319
let's return to our question from three

3287
02:19:24,359 --> 02:19:30,679
tangents ago why is sexuality vampiric

3288
02:19:28,319 --> 02:19:33,920
why is it so hard to make sexuality

3289
02:19:30,679 --> 02:19:36,200
conformed to Humane political ideals of

3290
02:19:33,920 --> 02:19:38,760
pacifism and equality I think part of

3291
02:19:36,200 --> 02:19:41,200
the answer is that sexuality inherently

3292
02:19:38,760 --> 02:19:43,800
involves the violation of boundaries and

3293
02:19:41,200 --> 02:19:45,840
the overcoming of barriers something has

3294
02:19:43,800 --> 02:19:48,240
to rip the bodice and there's a lot of

3295
02:19:45,840 --> 02:19:51,120
bodices to be ripped it's not just

3296
02:19:48,240 --> 02:19:53,560
Freud's guilt shame and anxiety it's not

3297
02:19:51,120 --> 02:19:56,920
just Nancy Friday's lifetime of women's

3298
02:19:53,560 --> 02:19:59,200
rules against sex it's also the taboo

3299
02:19:56,920 --> 02:20:01,520
against sex that allows Society to

3300
02:19:59,200 --> 02:20:03,960
function it's the fear of reproduction

3301
02:20:01,520 --> 02:20:06,760
and death the fear of losing your

3302
02:20:03,960 --> 02:20:09,160
identity and boundaries to desire and to

3303
02:20:06,760 --> 02:20:11,200
Fusion all of this must be overcome for

3304
02:20:09,160 --> 02:20:13,160
climax to be reached and we can

3305
02:20:11,200 --> 02:20:15,960
conceptualize the overcoming as a

3306
02:20:13,160 --> 02:20:18,359
conquest or a surrender but there is no

3307
02:20:15,960 --> 02:20:21,520
pacifying the emotional experience of

3308
02:20:18,359 --> 02:20:24,560
eroticism it's conflicted by Nature

3309
02:20:21,520 --> 02:20:28,040
Bittersweet eroticism is a dialectic of

3310
02:20:24,560 --> 02:20:30,920
life and death love and hate tenderness

3311
02:20:28,040 --> 02:20:34,160
and violence taboo and transgression

3312
02:20:30,920 --> 02:20:37,359
separation and unity and that's why

3313
02:20:34,160 --> 02:20:39,319
Edward Cullen is a Vampire the threat of

3314
02:20:37,359 --> 02:20:41,600
losing yourself of losing your

3315
02:20:39,319 --> 02:20:44,319
boundaries will always be a source of

3316
02:20:41,600 --> 02:20:46,479
ambivalence no matter how egalitarian or

3317
02:20:44,319 --> 02:20:49,000
how permissive society's attitudes

3318
02:20:46,479 --> 02:20:51,760
towards sex become satom masochistic

3319
02:20:49,000 --> 02:20:54,319
fantasy has psychological Origins that

3320
02:20:51,760 --> 02:20:56,840
cannot be fully explained by leftist

3321
02:20:54,319 --> 02:20:59,040
analysis of social hierarchy nor

3322
02:20:56,840 --> 02:21:01,680
abolished by Consciousness raising or

3323
02:20:59,040 --> 02:21:04,479
revolutionary action sexuality is not a

3324
02:21:01,680 --> 02:21:07,359
pure innocent thing that gets perverted

3325
02:21:04,479 --> 02:21:09,680
by corrupt Society no I agree with

3326
02:21:07,359 --> 02:21:12,319
Augustine that lust is inherently

3327
02:21:09,680 --> 02:21:14,600
perverted and society's role is to

3328
02:21:12,319 --> 02:21:17,120
channel it into Outlets that minimize

3329
02:21:14,600 --> 02:21:20,000
violence and those Outlets may include

3330
02:21:17,120 --> 02:21:22,560
novels and movies and erotica and

3331
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:25,520
problematic ships none of which are to

3332
02:21:22,560 --> 02:21:27,240
blame for perverting sexuality these

3333
02:21:25,520 --> 02:21:29,680
things are an expression of something

3334
02:21:27,240 --> 02:21:32,319
turbulent within us which for me is

3335
02:21:29,680 --> 02:21:35,200
symbolized by the Sea the inherently

3336
02:21:32,319 --> 02:21:37,200
erotic sea why is the ocean inherently

3337
02:21:35,200 --> 02:21:39,479
erotic well because of the rhythmic

3338
02:21:37,200 --> 02:21:42,280
expansion contraction cycles of her wave

3339
02:21:39,479 --> 02:21:44,880
motion yes of course but also because

3340
02:21:42,280 --> 02:21:47,240
she's mother because she's life she's

3341
02:21:44,880 --> 02:21:49,359
birth she's death She's the Primal

3342
02:21:47,240 --> 02:21:51,640
horror of Horrors and the sweet womb of

3343
02:21:49,359 --> 02:21:54,640
mother Knight she is erotic because she

3344
02:21:51,640 --> 02:21:57,040
beckons and we come Stephanie Meyer is

3345
02:21:54,640 --> 02:21:59,760
of course aware of all this maybe not

3346
02:21:57,040 --> 02:22:02,280
consciously but it's all there it's all

3347
02:21:59,760 --> 02:22:05,760
in Twilight Edward and Bella's ecstatic

3348
02:22:02,280 --> 02:22:09,399
Union takes place where in the sea as

3349
02:22:05,760 --> 02:22:13,040
Emily Dickinson said rowing in Eden ah

3350
02:22:09,399 --> 02:22:15,120
the sea might I put more tonight in

3351
02:22:13,040 --> 02:22:17,280
thee

3352
02:22:15,120 --> 02:22:19,359
penetration I know what you get up to

3353
02:22:17,280 --> 02:22:22,200
Emily and I'm reporting you to Sheila

3354
02:22:19,359 --> 02:22:24,680
Jeff

3355
02:22:22,200 --> 02:22:26,760
part six

3356
02:22:24,680 --> 02:22:28,960
identity I'm once again wearing an

3357
02:22:26,760 --> 02:22:31,240
evening gown at home in the middle of

3358
02:22:28,960 --> 02:22:33,720
the night to film a YouTube video by

3359
02:22:31,240 --> 02:22:36,680
myself well I do it for you the longest

3360
02:22:33,720 --> 02:22:38,000
Twilight book is midnight sun this thing

3361
02:22:36,680 --> 02:22:40,439
is like a blunt

3362
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:42,319
weapon Midnight Sun is the book that

3363
02:22:40,439 --> 02:22:44,760
retells Twilight from Edward's

3364
02:22:42,319 --> 02:22:46,600
perspective here's a question if the

3365
02:22:44,760 --> 02:22:48,960
wish fulfillment fantasy element of

3366
02:22:46,600 --> 02:22:50,960
Twilight relies on readers identifying

3367
02:22:48,960 --> 02:22:52,800
with Bella why would would Stephanie

3368
02:22:50,960 --> 02:22:54,840
Meyer rewrite it from Edward's

3369
02:22:52,800 --> 02:22:56,960
perspective why would snow Queen's ice

3370
02:22:54,840 --> 02:22:58,560
dragon copy Stephanie Meyer yet again

3371
02:22:56,960 --> 02:23:00,200
rewriting 50 Shades of Gray from

3372
02:22:58,560 --> 02:23:01,840
Christian's perspective well because

3373
02:23:00,200 --> 02:23:03,640
she's a hack who likes money and wants

3374
02:23:01,840 --> 02:23:06,160
to wear Stephanie's skin but a lot of

3375
02:23:03,640 --> 02:23:09,319
Twilight fans actually wanted Midnight

3376
02:23:06,160 --> 02:23:11,280
Sun why why would you want to spend 800

3377
02:23:09,319 --> 02:23:13,720
Pages inside the head of the world's

3378
02:23:11,280 --> 02:23:16,560
most dangerous predator well let's maybe

3379
02:23:13,720 --> 02:23:18,439
put it this way when you were a kid what

3380
02:23:16,560 --> 02:23:21,359
was the most popular week of programming

3381
02:23:18,439 --> 02:23:26,040
on the Discovery Channel kelp week

3382
02:23:21,359 --> 02:23:28,000
sardine week no Shark Week why

3383
02:23:26,040 --> 02:23:30,319
because sharks do murders I'm the

3384
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:32,800
world's most dangerous predator humans

3385
02:23:30,319 --> 02:23:34,640
are attracted to Predators because we're

3386
02:23:32,800 --> 02:23:36,720
attracted to power and we're usually

3387
02:23:34,640 --> 02:23:38,920
attracted to power not because we're

3388
02:23:36,720 --> 02:23:40,760
masochists who want to be prayed upon

3389
02:23:38,920 --> 02:23:43,000
but because we want to be powerful

3390
02:23:40,760 --> 02:23:45,800
ourselves it's what philosopher

3391
02:23:43,000 --> 02:23:47,760
Frederick nudson called the will to

3392
02:23:45,800 --> 02:23:49,640
power we're attracted to Predators

3393
02:23:47,760 --> 02:23:51,760
because it flatters our egos to

3394
02:23:49,640 --> 02:23:55,279
recognize part part of ourselves in

3395
02:23:51,760 --> 02:23:58,399
sharks or cats or Wolves whereas prey

3396
02:23:55,279 --> 02:24:01,560
animals calling someone a sheep or a pig

3397
02:23:58,399 --> 02:24:03,840
is usually an insult in my video on Envy

3398
02:24:01,560 --> 02:24:04,800
I argued that people resent power

3399
02:24:03,840 --> 02:24:06,520
actually that's a pretty terrible

3400
02:24:04,800 --> 02:24:08,600
summary of that video just go watch the

3401
02:24:06,520 --> 02:24:10,520
video and there's a usually right-wing

3402
02:24:08,600 --> 02:24:12,920
version of this argument that says we

3403
02:24:10,520 --> 02:24:15,120
live in a victimhood culture where all

3404
02:24:12,920 --> 02:24:17,760
discourse is grievance privilege is

3405
02:24:15,120 --> 02:24:19,880
despised everyone rhetorically positions

3406
02:24:17,760 --> 02:24:22,359
themselves as the innocent lamb Christ

3407
02:24:19,880 --> 02:24:24,200
on the cross I'm so oppressed but

3408
02:24:22,359 --> 02:24:26,200
resentment is just frustrated Will To

3409
02:24:24,200 --> 02:24:28,680
Power it's derivative of the will to

3410
02:24:26,200 --> 02:24:31,080
power you hate it cuz you ain't it and

3411
02:24:28,680 --> 02:24:33,439
resentment hurts Envy is the sin that

3412
02:24:31,080 --> 02:24:36,439
gives no pleasure so usually the path of

3413
02:24:33,439 --> 02:24:39,040
least resistance is to feel powerful by

3414
02:24:36,439 --> 02:24:41,560
identifying with power why do poor

3415
02:24:39,040 --> 02:24:43,479
downtrodden people support Rich powerful

3416
02:24:41,560 --> 02:24:45,240
politicians it's not just because they

3417
02:24:43,479 --> 02:24:47,279
see themselves as temporarily

3418
02:24:45,240 --> 02:24:49,479
embarrassed millionaires it's because

3419
02:24:47,279 --> 02:24:51,279
people identify with politicians they

3420
02:24:49,479 --> 02:24:54,040
support and and that makes them feel

3421
02:24:51,279 --> 02:24:56,279
powerful vicariously why are so many

3422
02:24:54,040 --> 02:24:58,920
weird nerds ready to die in battle for

3423
02:24:56,279 --> 02:25:01,200
Elon Musk isn't it because they identify

3424
02:24:58,920 --> 02:25:03,399
with him and so they feel that his power

3425
02:25:01,200 --> 02:25:05,560
is also theirs they're like the boy who

3426
02:25:03,399 --> 02:25:07,520
resolves the edus complex his feelings

3427
02:25:05,560 --> 02:25:10,479
of rivalry and jealousy toward his

3428
02:25:07,520 --> 02:25:12,520
father by identifying with his father

3429
02:25:10,479 --> 02:25:15,080
for similar reasons women sometimes

3430
02:25:12,520 --> 02:25:17,760
identify with male predators in the

3431
02:25:15,080 --> 02:25:20,680
1980s California was terrorized by

3432
02:25:17,760 --> 02:25:23,279
Richard Ramirez aka the nightstalker who

3433
02:25:20,680 --> 02:25:25,520
brutally murdered at least 13 people fan

3434
02:25:23,279 --> 02:25:27,720
girls and crime groupies adored him

3435
02:25:25,520 --> 02:25:30,600
throughout the trial with one admirer

3436
02:25:27,720 --> 02:25:33,040
eventually marrying him many such cases

3437
02:25:30,600 --> 02:25:35,240
Ted Bundy also married one of his fans

3438
02:25:33,040 --> 02:25:37,000
Jeffrey dmer got lots of fan mail from

3439
02:25:35,240 --> 02:25:39,359
women who thought they were attracted to

3440
02:25:37,000 --> 02:25:41,399
him Ramirez himself offered a theory

3441
02:25:39,359 --> 02:25:43,520
about his appeal to these women saying

3442
02:25:41,399 --> 02:25:45,880
quote I think the girls are attracted to

3443
02:25:43,520 --> 02:25:48,080
me because they can relate to me I think

3444
02:25:45,880 --> 02:25:50,439
that's essentially correct attraction to

3445
02:25:48,080 --> 02:25:52,640
serial killers is based on identific

3446
02:25:50,439 --> 02:25:54,960
ation with the criminal these women are

3447
02:25:52,640 --> 02:25:57,680
not masochists who want to be victims

3448
02:25:54,960 --> 02:26:00,279
they're aspiring to be the final girl to

3449
02:25:57,680 --> 02:26:02,520
Vicarious power in her book Savage

3450
02:26:00,279 --> 02:26:04,600
appetites Rachel Monroe says of serial

3451
02:26:02,520 --> 02:26:07,000
killer groupy quote in a world where

3452
02:26:04,600 --> 02:26:09,240
masculinity meant power and power meant

3453
02:26:07,000 --> 02:26:11,359
violence some women would always opt to

3454
02:26:09,240 --> 02:26:13,399
align themselves with that violence and

3455
02:26:11,359 --> 02:26:16,800
exert their own perverse power through

3456
02:26:13,399 --> 02:26:18,680
love it was a way to feel special chosen

3457
02:26:16,800 --> 02:26:21,640
but it was an ugly kind of special

3458
02:26:18,680 --> 02:26:23,880
tainted with other people's pain in 2018

3459
02:26:21,640 --> 02:26:26,120
a small publisher told Rachel we used to

3460
02:26:23,880 --> 02:26:29,080
do zombies and vampires but that's going

3461
02:26:26,120 --> 02:26:32,279
nowhere it's all true crime now has True

3462
02:26:29,080 --> 02:26:34,160
Crime replaced the vampire romance if so

3463
02:26:32,279 --> 02:26:36,880
I think that's unfortunate because

3464
02:26:34,160 --> 02:26:39,279
Jeffrey dmer has real victims and Edward

3465
02:26:36,880 --> 02:26:41,319
Cullen does not I feel like this is an

3466
02:26:39,279 --> 02:26:43,279
area where fiction is superior to

3467
02:26:41,319 --> 02:26:46,520
reality whenever I finish one of my

3468
02:26:43,279 --> 02:26:48,479
serial killer research binges I'm always

3469
02:26:46,520 --> 02:26:50,439
left with a feeling of disappointment

3470
02:26:48,479 --> 02:26:52,080
these are men with something less not

3471
02:26:50,439 --> 02:26:54,560
with something more what we really want

3472
02:26:52,080 --> 02:26:57,359
serial killers to be is Hannibal Lecter

3473
02:26:54,560 --> 02:26:59,359
powerful glamorous artistic and deadly

3474
02:26:57,359 --> 02:27:00,800
he combines the power of raw animal

3475
02:26:59,359 --> 02:27:03,359
aggression with the power of

3476
02:27:00,800 --> 02:27:05,720
sophisticated civilized culture that's

3477
02:27:03,359 --> 02:27:07,960
why he's daddy True Crime is shark weak

3478
02:27:05,720 --> 02:27:10,399
for grown-ups we're transfixed by the

3479
02:27:07,960 --> 02:27:12,560
beauty of power and the power of beauty

3480
02:27:10,399 --> 02:27:15,000
and in case this needs to be said the

3481
02:27:12,560 --> 02:27:16,880
desire for power is a facet of human

3482
02:27:15,000 --> 02:27:19,640
personality that is not going to be

3483
02:27:16,880 --> 02:27:21,840
solved by lesbianism as if lesbians

3484
02:27:19,640 --> 02:27:23,960
never desired powerful women as if no

3485
02:27:21,840 --> 02:27:26,640
gay woman has ever wanted Mommy to step

3486
02:27:23,960 --> 02:27:28,359
on her like come on pay attention but

3487
02:27:26,640 --> 02:27:31,120
it's true that for most women

3488
02:27:28,359 --> 02:27:33,399
identifying with power means identifying

3489
02:27:31,120 --> 02:27:35,680
with men for most of History merging

3490
02:27:33,399 --> 02:27:37,960
with a man has been many women's only

3491
02:27:35,680 --> 02:27:40,520
plausible path to power traditional

3492
02:27:37,960 --> 02:27:43,160
marriage strongly incentivizes women to

3493
02:27:40,520 --> 02:27:46,720
identify with their husbands and enjoy

3494
02:27:43,160 --> 02:27:48,720
his power vicariously as a 1966 Supreme

3495
02:27:46,720 --> 02:27:51,880
Court opinion put it though the husband

3496
02:27:48,720 --> 02:27:53,600
and wife are one the one is the husband

3497
02:27:51,880 --> 02:27:56,359
most married women still take their

3498
02:27:53,600 --> 02:27:59,279
husband's surname symbolically subsuming

3499
02:27:56,359 --> 02:28:02,960
her identity into his on the altar

3500
02:27:59,279 --> 02:28:06,160
Isabella Swan becomes Mrs Edward Cullen

3501
02:28:02,960 --> 02:28:08,359
she is he now even if it's anti-feminist

3502
02:28:06,160 --> 02:28:11,200
for a woman to fantasize about obtaining

3503
02:28:08,359 --> 02:28:13,800
Power by merging with a man it still has

3504
02:28:11,200 --> 02:28:16,439
to be said that this is not really

3505
02:28:13,800 --> 02:28:18,800
masochism it's still a kind of power

3506
02:28:16,439 --> 02:28:21,160
fantasy masochism would be if in

3507
02:28:18,800 --> 02:28:24,080
Breaking Dawn Bell just gets eaten by

3508
02:28:21,160 --> 02:28:26,319
the vampires the end but that's not what

3509
02:28:24,080 --> 02:28:28,800
happens according to Stephanie meyer.com

3510
02:28:26,319 --> 02:28:30,279
breaking Dawn's cover is a metaphor for

3511
02:28:28,800 --> 02:28:32,640
Bella's progression throughout the

3512
02:28:30,279 --> 02:28:35,279
entire Saga she began as the weakest

3513
02:28:32,640 --> 02:28:38,399
player on the board the pawn she ended

3514
02:28:35,279 --> 02:28:39,960
as the strongest the queen likewise 50

3515
02:28:38,399 --> 02:28:42,120
Shades of Gray concludes with

3516
02:28:39,960 --> 02:28:44,279
Christian's admission that Anastasia is

3517
02:28:42,120 --> 02:28:46,800
topping from the bottom you're topping

3518
02:28:44,279 --> 02:28:49,680
from the bottom Mrs

3519
02:28:46,800 --> 02:28:51,840
Gray but I can live with that isn't that

3520
02:28:49,680 --> 02:28:54,240
the fan fanty that it's really the woman

3521
02:28:51,840 --> 02:28:56,560
who controls male power who's topping

3522
02:28:54,240 --> 02:28:59,160
from the bottom I think some degree of

3523
02:28:56,560 --> 02:29:01,720
male identification is a normal part of

3524
02:28:59,160 --> 02:29:04,040
women's experience in weaing Heights

3525
02:29:01,720 --> 02:29:07,600
Catherine says I love him because he's

3526
02:29:04,040 --> 02:29:11,120
more myself than I am I am heathcliffe

3527
02:29:07,600 --> 02:29:13,399
Ursula kwinn says I am the generic he as

3528
02:29:11,120 --> 02:29:16,680
in a writer knows which side his bread

3529
02:29:13,399 --> 02:29:20,200
is buttered on that's me the writer him

3530
02:29:16,680 --> 02:29:22,359
I am a man men are viewed as default and

3531
02:29:20,200 --> 02:29:24,680
women tend to be fluent in adopting a

3532
02:29:22,359 --> 02:29:27,160
masculine perspective it makes me sad

3533
02:29:24,680 --> 02:29:28,800
that when a woman writes a book from a

3534
02:29:27,160 --> 02:29:31,080
woman's perspective pretty much only

3535
02:29:28,800 --> 02:29:32,800
women read it whereas I read books

3536
02:29:31,080 --> 02:29:34,120
written by men about men's perspective

3537
02:29:32,800 --> 02:29:35,560
all the time and this could be why men

3538
02:29:34,120 --> 02:29:37,319
don't think they understand women

3539
02:29:35,560 --> 02:29:39,439
because you don't read our perspective

3540
02:29:37,319 --> 02:29:41,640
as much as we read yours this is

3541
02:29:39,439 --> 02:29:43,279
relevant to understanding Twilight as

3542
02:29:41,640 --> 02:29:45,279
fantasy because if readers are

3543
02:29:43,279 --> 02:29:48,319
identifying with Edward rather than

3544
02:29:45,279 --> 02:29:50,600
Bella then this isn't female masochism

3545
02:29:48,319 --> 02:29:53,359
is it the reader isn't being dominated

3546
02:29:50,600 --> 02:29:55,760
by Edward because she is Edward on this

3547
02:29:53,359 --> 02:29:58,720
interpretation romance fantasies with an

3548
02:29:55,760 --> 02:30:00,640
alpha monster hero are simply vicarious

3549
02:29:58,720 --> 02:30:02,560
power fantasies but to reduce the

3550
02:30:00,640 --> 02:30:05,359
reader's experience to male

3551
02:30:02,560 --> 02:30:06,840
identification is also too simple I've

3552
02:30:05,359 --> 02:30:08,600
been sitting in front of this fruit tart

3553
02:30:06,840 --> 02:30:10,560
for 40 minutes I'm going to start eating

3554
02:30:08,600 --> 02:30:12,960
it it's happening in her essay the

3555
02:30:10,560 --> 02:30:15,439
androgynous reader romance writer Laura

3556
02:30:12,960 --> 02:30:17,680
kinale argues that romance novels have

3557
02:30:15,439 --> 02:30:20,000
nothing to do with women's relationships

3558
02:30:17,680 --> 02:30:22,359
with actual men but rather quote the

3559
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:24,600
whole Adventure is an interior one

3560
02:30:22,359 --> 02:30:26,920
romance fantasy then is basically a

3561
02:30:24,600 --> 02:30:29,439
Psycho Drama between different elements

3562
02:30:26,920 --> 02:30:31,680
of the reader's own personality quote

3563
02:30:29,439 --> 02:30:34,520
romance reflects the exploration and

3564
02:30:31,680 --> 02:30:37,359
Reconciliation of male elephants male

3565
02:30:34,520 --> 02:30:38,840
elephants are you you kidding me romance

3566
02:30:37,359 --> 02:30:41,080
reflects the exploration and

3567
02:30:38,840 --> 02:30:43,240
Reconciliation of male elements within

3568
02:30:41,080 --> 02:30:45,800
the female reader the romance hero

3569
02:30:43,240 --> 02:30:48,479
represents the readers animus the man

3570
02:30:45,800 --> 02:30:51,000
within her aggressive adventurous

3571
02:30:48,479 --> 02:30:53,439
masculine side so unlike the strict

3572
02:30:51,000 --> 02:30:56,160
subject object dichotomy Laura muli

3573
02:30:53,439 --> 02:30:58,200
describes as the male gaze in cinema the

3574
02:30:56,160 --> 02:31:00,600
female Viewpoint in Romance is

3575
02:30:58,200 --> 02:31:02,920
inherently gender fluid kinale says

3576
02:31:00,600 --> 02:31:04,800
quote it is myopic to believe that just

3577
02:31:02,920 --> 02:31:07,120
because the reader is female she is

3578
02:31:04,800 --> 02:31:10,040
confined to the heroin's character the

3579
02:31:07,120 --> 02:31:12,279
female reader is the hero and also is

3580
02:31:10,040 --> 02:31:14,640
the heroine as object of the hero's

3581
02:31:12,279 --> 02:31:16,960
interest the heroine in a romance novel

3582
02:31:14,640 --> 02:31:18,960
is not a character the reader identifies

3583
02:31:16,960 --> 02:31:21,800
with the way you might identify with a

3584
02:31:18,960 --> 02:31:24,200
superhero and some aspirational way

3585
02:31:21,800 --> 02:31:26,640
instead the heroin is a placeholder for

3586
02:31:24,200 --> 02:31:30,399
the reader who both identifies with the

3587
02:31:26,640 --> 02:31:32,800
hero and wishes to be loved by him every

3588
02:31:30,399 --> 02:31:34,680
girl projects their own personalities

3589
02:31:32,800 --> 02:31:36,160
onto her so it was weird playing the

3590
02:31:34,680 --> 02:31:38,640
part cuz I didn't feel like it was a big

3591
02:31:36,160 --> 02:31:39,960
departure I was there was no distinct

3592
02:31:38,640 --> 02:31:42,080
character I was playing I was really

3593
02:31:39,960 --> 02:31:44,000
just this girl this makes sense in light

3594
02:31:42,080 --> 02:31:46,319
of the way the Twilight fandom reacted

3595
02:31:44,000 --> 02:31:48,319
to Kristen Stewart in the role of Bella

3596
02:31:46,319 --> 02:31:50,800
Kristen Stewart was widely hated in the

3597
02:31:48,319 --> 02:31:53,200
role of Bella I think in part because

3598
02:31:50,800 --> 02:31:55,560
fans of Twilight didn't view her or

3599
02:31:53,200 --> 02:31:58,359
Bella as an ideal they could identify

3600
02:31:55,560 --> 02:32:00,600
with but rather as a kind of rival in

3601
02:31:58,359 --> 02:32:04,359
the book Bella is described in a mildly

3602
02:32:00,600 --> 02:32:06,439
depreciatory sort of way clumsy ordinary

3603
02:32:04,359 --> 02:32:08,760
this makes her not enviable and

3604
02:32:06,439 --> 02:32:11,040
therefore not an intimidating rival many

3605
02:32:08,760 --> 02:32:13,399
critics find Bella to be Bland but her

3606
02:32:11,040 --> 02:32:15,880
blandness is part of the appeal it suits

3607
02:32:13,399 --> 02:32:17,680
her rule as placeholder and then Kristen

3608
02:32:15,880 --> 02:32:20,479
Stewart ruined everything by being

3609
02:32:17,680 --> 02:32:22,200
gorgeous how dare she so let's contrast

3610
02:32:20,479 --> 02:32:23,840
the difference between two fantasy

3611
02:32:22,200 --> 02:32:26,080
structures the gender fluid

3612
02:32:23,840 --> 02:32:28,600
identifications of the feminine romance

3613
02:32:26,080 --> 02:32:31,160
Fantasy Versus the subject object

3614
02:32:28,600 --> 02:32:33,800
splitting of the male gaze John Berger

3615
02:32:31,160 --> 02:32:35,880
who coined the term male gaze says men

3616
02:32:33,800 --> 02:32:38,279
look at women women watch themselves

3617
02:32:35,880 --> 02:32:41,479
being looked at the surveyor of woman in

3618
02:32:38,279 --> 02:32:43,640
herself is male the surveyed female the

3619
02:32:41,479 --> 02:32:46,399
male gaze exemplifies what we could

3620
02:32:43,640 --> 02:32:49,000
tentatively call a masculine fantasy

3621
02:32:46,399 --> 02:32:50,920
type where you identify with a masculine

3622
02:32:49,000 --> 02:32:53,800
subject design Desiring a feminine

3623
02:32:50,920 --> 02:32:56,200
object and in the feminine fantasy type

3624
02:32:53,800 --> 02:32:58,520
identification is split between the

3625
02:32:56,200 --> 02:33:01,640
Desiring masculine subject and The

3626
02:32:58,520 --> 02:33:04,359
Feminine self as object of Desire so you

3627
02:33:01,640 --> 02:33:06,720
simultaneously identify with Edward and

3628
02:33:04,359 --> 02:33:08,640
you imagine yourself as the Beloved

3629
02:33:06,720 --> 02:33:10,680
object of Edward's desire a

3630
02:33:08,640 --> 02:33:13,800
distinguishing feature of the feminine

3631
02:33:10,680 --> 02:33:16,640
beloved fantasy is that in a sense the

3632
02:33:13,800 --> 02:33:18,520
object of Desire is yourself this has

3633
02:33:16,640 --> 02:33:20,520
led some people to conclude that

3634
02:33:18,520 --> 02:33:24,000
feminine fantasy is essentially

3635
02:33:20,520 --> 02:33:26,000
autoerotic or narcissistic deor says in

3636
02:33:24,000 --> 02:33:28,359
solitary pleasure it may happen that the

3637
02:33:26,000 --> 02:33:30,720
woman splits into a male subject and a

3638
02:33:28,359 --> 02:33:32,800
female object she describes a female

3639
02:33:30,720 --> 02:33:35,760
patient of psychoanalysis who said to

3640
02:33:32,800 --> 02:33:38,760
herself I'm going to love myself or more

3641
02:33:35,760 --> 02:33:40,960
passionately I'm going to possess myself

3642
02:33:38,760 --> 02:33:43,399
Margaret Atwood says you are a woman

3643
02:33:40,960 --> 02:33:46,040
with a man inside watching a woman you

3644
02:33:43,399 --> 02:33:48,760
are your own voer there definitely is an

3645
02:33:46,040 --> 02:33:50,240
autoerotic aspect of feminine fantasy

3646
02:33:48,760 --> 02:33:52,640
though I think it's unfair and

3647
02:33:50,240 --> 02:33:54,840
stigmatizing to say that narcissistic

3648
02:33:52,640 --> 02:33:57,319
love is specifically feminine like think

3649
02:33:54,840 --> 02:34:00,080
about the masculine concept of a trophy

3650
02:33:57,319 --> 02:34:02,240
wife is that not erotic narcissism a man

3651
02:34:00,080 --> 02:34:04,800
wants a beautiful woman because of what

3652
02:34:02,240 --> 02:34:07,279
having a beautiful woman says about him

3653
02:34:04,800 --> 02:34:09,479
or a pickup artist who wants a high body

3654
02:34:07,279 --> 02:34:11,439
count because that inflates his ego

3655
02:34:09,479 --> 02:34:13,560
Freud says that ego is the original

3656
02:34:11,439 --> 02:34:15,920
reservoir of the libido there's an awful

3657
02:34:13,560 --> 02:34:17,640
lot of narcissism to go around now that

3658
02:34:15,920 --> 02:34:19,960
I think about it there's many kinds of

3659
02:34:17,640 --> 02:34:22,359
narcissistic love there's I love that

3660
02:34:19,960 --> 02:34:25,439
you love me there's I love what I see of

3661
02:34:22,359 --> 02:34:27,720
myself in you there's I identify with

3662
02:34:25,439 --> 02:34:30,200
you and love myself as the object of

3663
02:34:27,720 --> 02:34:32,520
your love there's I love what having you

3664
02:34:30,200 --> 02:34:34,160
says about me it's like when Bella shows

3665
02:34:32,520 --> 02:34:36,680
up at school for the first time with

3666
02:34:34,160 --> 02:34:38,920
Edward as her cool new boyfriend proving

3667
02:34:36,680 --> 02:34:41,279
to everyone that she is cool too you

3668
02:34:38,920 --> 02:34:43,960
know everybody's staring it's totally

3669
02:34:41,279 --> 02:34:46,439
gorgeous obviously but apparently nobody

3670
02:34:43,960 --> 02:34:49,000
here is good enough for him but Bella is

3671
02:34:46,439 --> 02:34:51,240
Bella is good enough for him she has

3672
02:34:49,000 --> 02:34:54,200
what everyone wants even though she's

3673
02:34:51,240 --> 02:34:56,520
not the captain of the volleyball team

3674
02:34:54,200 --> 02:34:57,920
I'm just kidding I'm just kidding or the

3675
02:34:56,520 --> 02:35:00,279
president of the student council half

3676
02:34:57,920 --> 02:35:02,279
the feminine fantasy is loving yourself

3677
02:35:00,279 --> 02:35:04,800
Through The Eyes of the hero so the more

3678
02:35:02,279 --> 02:35:07,120
powerful and esteemed the hero is the

3679
02:35:04,800 --> 02:35:08,800
more elevated the woman becomes as his

3680
02:35:07,120 --> 02:35:11,040
beloved and you may as well shoot for

3681
02:35:08,800 --> 02:35:13,760
the moon Darcy is one of the richest men

3682
02:35:11,040 --> 02:35:16,600
in England Edward is a quote Godlike

3683
02:35:13,760 --> 02:35:19,040
creature a Perpetual savior the world's

3684
02:35:16,600 --> 02:35:21,560
most dangerous predator Christian Gray

3685
02:35:19,040 --> 02:35:24,279
is master of the Universe I feel like

3686
02:35:21,560 --> 02:35:26,800
this grandiosity compensates women for

3687
02:35:24,279 --> 02:35:28,920
being stuck playing second violin the

3688
02:35:26,800 --> 02:35:31,240
escalation into theology is just the

3689
02:35:28,920 --> 02:35:33,920
inevitable conclusion St Angela of

3690
02:35:31,240 --> 02:35:36,800
Felino claims Jesus told her my daughter

3691
02:35:33,920 --> 02:35:39,560
and my sweet spouse I love you so much

3692
02:35:36,800 --> 02:35:42,560
more than any other woman I'm not like

3693
02:35:39,560 --> 02:35:44,200
other girls in the eyes of God in Harry

3694
02:35:42,560 --> 02:35:46,359
Potter fandom there were these women

3695
02:35:44,200 --> 02:35:48,200
called Snape wives why is it always

3696
02:35:46,359 --> 02:35:50,560
Harry Potter can we do one video without

3697
02:35:48,200 --> 02:35:52,840
talking about Harry Potter Snape wives

3698
02:35:50,560 --> 02:35:54,840
believed that seus Snape was a literal

3699
02:35:52,840 --> 02:35:57,479
god with whom they could have a personal

3700
02:35:54,840 --> 02:36:00,000
erotic relationship on the astral plane

3701
02:35:57,479 --> 02:36:02,319
in her seminal paper on Snape wives Zoe

3702
02:36:00,000 --> 02:36:04,840
alerton quotes a Snape wife who claims

3703
02:36:02,319 --> 02:36:07,560
that seus Snape would use her husband as

3704
02:36:04,840 --> 02:36:09,760
a vessel during the physical act of love

3705
02:36:07,560 --> 02:36:11,560
so that while making love to her husband

3706
02:36:09,760 --> 02:36:14,240
she felt that she was metaphysically

3707
02:36:11,560 --> 02:36:16,640
making love to her Lord and Master seus

3708
02:36:14,240 --> 02:36:18,760
Snape and it seems like Snape was chosen

3709
02:36:16,640 --> 02:36:20,279
because these women identify with him

3710
02:36:18,760 --> 02:36:22,319
for the same reasons women have always

3711
02:36:20,279 --> 02:36:25,319
identified with Jesus because he has

3712
02:36:22,319 --> 02:36:27,439
relatable feminine coded trauma abused

3713
02:36:25,319 --> 02:36:29,920
humiliated penetrated even in the case

3714
02:36:27,439 --> 02:36:32,399
of Jesus but he also happens to be the

3715
02:36:29,920 --> 02:36:35,640
God who loves you it's like a fantasy of

3716
02:36:32,399 --> 02:36:37,920
being Mary in the P the feminine urge to

3717
02:36:35,640 --> 02:36:40,800
be daddy's Mommy so if you take the

3718
02:36:37,920 --> 02:36:43,240
feminine beloved fantasy to its extreme

3719
02:36:40,800 --> 02:36:46,080
this is what you end up with narcissism

3720
02:36:43,240 --> 02:36:48,160
escalated to theological proportions and

3721
02:36:46,080 --> 02:36:50,560
if you take the masculine lover fantasy

3722
02:36:48,160 --> 02:36:52,880
to its extreme you get objectification

3723
02:36:50,560 --> 02:36:55,000
to the point of predation this desire to

3724
02:36:52,880 --> 02:36:57,560
pursue and possess that can get a little

3725
02:36:55,000 --> 02:36:59,439
Jeffrey dmer a little Ted Bundy now

3726
02:36:57,560 --> 02:37:02,319
every generalization about gender and

3727
02:36:59,439 --> 02:37:03,960
sexuality is an overgeneralization and

3728
02:37:02,319 --> 02:37:06,359
I've been calling these two fantasy

3729
02:37:03,960 --> 02:37:08,399
types masculine and feminine because

3730
02:37:06,359 --> 02:37:10,399
that's how most people recognize them

3731
02:37:08,399 --> 02:37:13,359
but now we need to question the

3732
02:37:10,399 --> 02:37:15,680
assumption that lover equals masculine

3733
02:37:13,359 --> 02:37:18,319
and beloved equals feminine this

3734
02:37:15,680 --> 02:37:20,439
assumption is part of dhsm default

3735
02:37:18,319 --> 02:37:23,479
heterosexual St of mascul ISM and it's

3736
02:37:20,439 --> 02:37:26,040
oppressive and imprecise and I hate it

3737
02:37:23,479 --> 02:37:28,960
both straight and gay people frequently

3738
02:37:26,040 --> 02:37:33,200
conflate the diads masculine feminine

3739
02:37:28,960 --> 02:37:35,120
top bottom Dom sub lover beloved and

3740
02:37:33,200 --> 02:37:37,240
again I really want to emphasize that

3741
02:37:35,120 --> 02:37:39,880
masculine feminine refers to gender

3742
02:37:37,240 --> 02:37:42,279
expression top and bottom are sexual

3743
02:37:39,880 --> 02:37:44,800
positions Dom and sub are roles in a

3744
02:37:42,279 --> 02:37:47,200
power Dynamic and lover and beloved are

3745
02:37:44,800 --> 02:37:49,640
relationship rules that correspond to

3746
02:37:47,200 --> 02:37:51,800
different ways of structuring Desire the

3747
02:37:49,640 --> 02:37:54,399
lover is captivated by Beauty and

3748
02:37:51,800 --> 02:37:56,399
pursues it the Beloved either desires

3749
02:37:54,399 --> 02:37:58,960
the desire of the lover or

3750
02:37:56,399 --> 02:38:01,040
narcissistically enjoys thems as a

3751
02:37:58,960 --> 02:38:03,439
beautiful object as that which is

3752
02:38:01,040 --> 02:38:05,640
desired and pursued I don't buy the

3753
02:38:03,439 --> 02:38:08,000
anatomical Destiny argument that says

3754
02:38:05,640 --> 02:38:10,600
that men naturally pursue because their

3755
02:38:08,000 --> 02:38:12,520
Anatomy is pointed outward and women are

3756
02:38:10,600 --> 02:38:15,000
narcissists because their Anatomy is

3757
02:38:12,520 --> 02:38:17,880
pointed inward like do men not have

3758
02:38:15,000 --> 02:38:20,000
holes do men not have holes do women not

3759
02:38:17,880 --> 02:38:22,840
have external anatomy of Their Own

3760
02:38:20,000 --> 02:38:25,920
you can be a feminine top or a masculine

3761
02:38:22,840 --> 02:38:27,720
submissive or even a dominant bottom the

3762
02:38:25,920 --> 02:38:30,120
lover fantasy structure does not

3763
02:38:27,720 --> 02:38:33,359
inherently take a feminine person as the

3764
02:38:30,120 --> 02:38:35,600
Beloved but dhsm is so prevalent that

3765
02:38:33,359 --> 02:38:37,680
it's easy to make this mistake I'm sure

3766
02:38:35,600 --> 02:38:39,720
you can find examples of me doing it

3767
02:38:37,680 --> 02:38:42,000
like a lot of trans women early in my

3768
02:38:39,720 --> 02:38:44,800
transition I brought a lot of misery on

3769
02:38:42,000 --> 02:38:47,720
myself by unconsciously assuming that

3770
02:38:44,800 --> 02:38:50,920
women equals submissive equals attracted

3771
02:38:47,720 --> 02:38:54,120
to men which no this is cringe and

3772
02:38:50,920 --> 02:38:56,040
homophobic and misogynistic stop it I

3773
02:38:54,120 --> 02:38:58,040
forgive myself because this Prejudice is

3774
02:38:56,040 --> 02:39:00,399
extremely prevalent there are even

3775
02:38:58,040 --> 02:39:03,160
sophisticated theorists of gender that

3776
02:39:00,399 --> 02:39:05,120
slip into this even Simone deovir still

3777
02:39:03,160 --> 02:39:07,560
one of the best commentators on gender

3778
02:39:05,120 --> 02:39:10,200
ever in my opinion makes this mistake

3779
02:39:07,560 --> 02:39:12,600
she says quote man with his hard muscles

3780
02:39:10,200 --> 02:39:14,800
his scratchy and often hairy skin his

3781
02:39:12,600 --> 02:39:17,080
crude odor and his coarse features does

3782
02:39:14,800 --> 02:39:19,680
not seem desirable to women and he even

3783
02:39:17,080 --> 02:39:22,160
stir her repulsion if the prehensive

3784
02:39:19,680 --> 02:39:24,600
possessive tendency exists in wom more

3785
02:39:22,160 --> 02:39:26,680
strongly her orientation will be toward

3786
02:39:24,600 --> 02:39:28,960
homosexuality so she's conflating

3787
02:39:26,680 --> 02:39:30,920
femininity with the Beloved and just

3788
02:39:28,960 --> 02:39:34,640
assuming that women are not actively

3789
02:39:30,920 --> 02:39:36,760
attracted to coars hairy men Simone

3790
02:39:34,640 --> 02:39:40,160
that's just the lesbianism talking and I

3791
02:39:36,760 --> 02:39:42,319
mean same but this is our emotional bias

3792
02:39:40,160 --> 02:39:45,600
there are absolutely people some of them

3793
02:39:42,319 --> 02:39:47,960
women who go wild for hairy smelly

3794
02:39:45,600 --> 02:39:49,920
masculine bodies it's like their entire

3795
02:39:47,960 --> 02:39:52,359
thing in fact I can name it these three

3796
02:39:49,920 --> 02:39:54,840
people who are attracted to men now it

3797
02:39:52,359 --> 02:39:57,240
is interesting to ask what is left of

3798
02:39:54,840 --> 02:40:00,160
femininity when you separate it from its

3799
02:39:57,240 --> 02:40:02,120
associations with submission passivity

3800
02:40:00,160 --> 02:40:04,640
and the role of the Beloved that which

3801
02:40:02,120 --> 02:40:06,880
is desired is femininity just an

3802
02:40:04,640 --> 02:40:10,399
aesthetic I think gender expression is

3803
02:40:06,880 --> 02:40:12,479
not just aesthetic it's style and style

3804
02:40:10,399 --> 02:40:14,960
is more than aesthetic it's a way of

3805
02:40:12,479 --> 02:40:17,960
doing things like a dominant woman can

3806
02:40:14,960 --> 02:40:20,680
be a daddy Dom or a mommy Dom depending

3807
02:40:17,960 --> 02:40:23,200
on how she styles dominance we can maybe

3808
02:40:20,680 --> 02:40:25,319
say that femininity is a stylization of

3809
02:40:23,200 --> 02:40:28,880
the female and masculinity is a

3810
02:40:25,319 --> 02:40:30,880
stylization of the male dhsm is bad

3811
02:40:28,880 --> 02:40:32,680
first because it treats as equivalent

3812
02:40:30,880 --> 02:40:35,840
all these diads that are not even

3813
02:40:32,680 --> 02:40:38,000
necessarily correlated and second dhsm

3814
02:40:35,840 --> 02:40:40,840
is bad because it doesn't recognize the

3815
02:40:38,000 --> 02:40:43,720
versatility that is possible within each

3816
02:40:40,840 --> 02:40:46,200
diet dhsm assumes that in every

3817
02:40:43,720 --> 02:40:49,120
relationship one partner has to be the

3818
02:40:46,200 --> 02:40:51,920
man wear the pants and it also assumes

3819
02:40:49,120 --> 02:40:55,080
that that top bottom Dom sub lover

3820
02:40:51,920 --> 02:40:57,000
beloved are fixed binary roles which is

3821
02:40:55,080 --> 02:40:59,880
just not true in fact I think it's often

3822
02:40:57,000 --> 02:41:02,040
dysfunctional to suit sexuality in half

3823
02:40:59,880 --> 02:41:05,200
this way like in a common heterosexual

3824
02:41:02,040 --> 02:41:08,240
Dynamic the man desires the woman's body

3825
02:41:05,200 --> 02:41:09,840
and the woman desires the man's desire I

3826
02:41:08,240 --> 02:41:11,880
think this is dysfunctional because in

3827
02:41:09,840 --> 02:41:14,279
order to maintain the separation where

3828
02:41:11,880 --> 02:41:16,640
he is the subject and she is the object

3829
02:41:14,279 --> 02:41:19,040
the man has to degrade and objectify the

3830
02:41:16,640 --> 02:41:21,080
woman but the woman's ego is wounded by

3831
02:41:19,040 --> 02:41:23,200
the degradation so in order to

3832
02:41:21,080 --> 02:41:25,000
compensate she has to imagine that

3833
02:41:23,200 --> 02:41:27,479
instead of the mediocre schlub she's

3834
02:41:25,000 --> 02:41:29,800
married to she's instead surrendering to

3835
02:41:27,479 --> 02:41:32,640
the master of the universe her Lord and

3836
02:41:29,800 --> 02:41:34,840
Savior seus Snape I've noticed that even

3837
02:41:32,640 --> 02:41:37,080
conservative straight people reveal at

3838
02:41:34,840 --> 02:41:39,399
times a repressed longing for

3839
02:41:37,080 --> 02:41:41,720
versatility like so many straight men

3840
02:41:39,399 --> 02:41:44,399
who complain about male loneliness and

3841
02:41:41,720 --> 02:41:47,000
involuntary celibacy seem to think that

3842
02:41:44,399 --> 02:41:48,920
rning to traditional gender rules will

3843
02:41:47,000 --> 02:41:50,439
solve their problems but if you really

3844
02:41:48,920 --> 02:41:52,120
get into into it with these men it's

3845
02:41:50,439 --> 02:41:53,960
often clear that what's really eating

3846
02:41:52,120 --> 02:41:56,640
them up inside is that they've never

3847
02:41:53,960 --> 02:41:59,319
felt desired by a woman once in their

3848
02:41:56,640 --> 02:42:01,760
entire lives what they want is to feel

3849
02:41:59,319 --> 02:42:04,000
desired there's some part of them that

3850
02:42:01,760 --> 02:42:06,120
wants to be the Beloved but they don't

3851
02:42:04,000 --> 02:42:08,399
have the words for that it doesn't fit

3852
02:42:06,120 --> 02:42:10,520
into their idea of masculinity the

3853
02:42:08,399 --> 02:42:13,680
traditional gender roles they want to R

3854
02:42:10,520 --> 02:42:16,000
Vern to assign the Beloved role to women

3855
02:42:13,680 --> 02:42:18,080
and so many men feel that masculinity

3856
02:42:16,000 --> 02:42:19,680
requires them to be dominant and in

3857
02:42:18,080 --> 02:42:21,600
control all the time

3858
02:42:19,680 --> 02:42:24,279
but that's unbalanced you know learning

3859
02:42:21,600 --> 02:42:26,479
to enjoy submission builds character and

3860
02:42:24,279 --> 02:42:29,120
it's a valuable life skill don't we all

3861
02:42:26,479 --> 02:42:31,560
have to surrender in the end likewise a

3862
02:42:29,120 --> 02:42:34,479
lot of women yearn to explore the more

3863
02:42:31,560 --> 02:42:36,880
active verile side of sexuality in her

3864
02:42:34,479 --> 02:42:38,800
book girls who like boys who like boys

3865
02:42:36,880 --> 02:42:42,640
Lucy Neville argues that male male

3866
02:42:38,800 --> 02:42:45,040
erotica boys love slfi yahoi are very

3867
02:42:42,640 --> 02:42:47,080
popular among women in part because they

3868
02:42:45,040 --> 02:42:49,920
make more room for versatility and

3869
02:42:47,080 --> 02:42:52,359
fluidity than heterosexual ventions will

3870
02:42:49,920 --> 02:42:54,200
allow this channel is a fujoshi safe

3871
02:42:52,359 --> 02:42:56,680
space I say women's sexual

3872
02:42:54,200 --> 02:42:58,319
identification with men whether in slash

3873
02:42:56,680 --> 02:43:00,720
fiction or mainstream romance that

3874
02:42:58,319 --> 02:43:04,080
includes a male perspective I see it as

3875
02:43:00,720 --> 02:43:06,640
disproving a basic Assumption of dhsm if

3876
02:43:04,080 --> 02:43:08,760
women were just submissive by Nature why

3877
02:43:06,640 --> 02:43:11,120
would they sexually identify with men to

3878
02:43:08,760 --> 02:43:14,080
this extent even Stephanie Meyers

3879
02:43:11,120 --> 02:43:17,040
heterosexual world of Innocence has its

3880
02:43:14,080 --> 02:43:19,200
subversive gender fluid elements Edward

3881
02:43:17,040 --> 02:43:21,520
Cullen while in some ways a typical

3882
02:43:19,200 --> 02:43:24,640
lover father God figure of feminine

3883
02:43:21,520 --> 02:43:28,439
fantasy also has an alluring demure

3884
02:43:24,640 --> 02:43:31,040
feminine appeal he Sparkles he glowers

3885
02:43:28,439 --> 02:43:33,080
sometimes he needs rescuing don't women

3886
02:43:31,040 --> 02:43:35,479
sometimes want to pursue and enjoy a

3887
02:43:33,080 --> 02:43:38,479
beautiful person's body Bella clearly

3888
02:43:35,479 --> 02:43:40,880
does in Breaking Dawn Bella as a newborn

3889
02:43:38,479 --> 02:43:43,200
vampire becomes stronger than Edward

3890
02:43:40,880 --> 02:43:46,520
it's even implied that she becomes the

3891
02:43:43,200 --> 02:43:50,359
dominant it's your turn not to break

3892
02:43:46,520 --> 02:43:52,520
me top Bella is canon I arrest my case

3893
02:43:50,359 --> 02:43:54,520
so if even something as conservative and

3894
02:43:52,520 --> 02:43:57,520
thoroughly heterosexual as

3895
02:43:54,520 --> 02:44:01,200
Twilight contains a quiet but persistant

3896
02:43:57,520 --> 02:44:03,600
protest against dhsm then maybe dhsm has

3897
02:44:01,200 --> 02:44:06,160
got to go now I don't think abolishing

3898
02:44:03,600 --> 02:44:08,040
heterosexuality is realistic I would bet

3899
02:44:06,160 --> 02:44:10,160
a lot of money that for the foreseeable

3900
02:44:08,040 --> 02:44:12,279
future most men will continue to be

3901
02:44:10,160 --> 02:44:14,800
attracted to women and vice versa and

3902
02:44:12,279 --> 02:44:16,840
I've also argued that sedom masochism is

3903
02:44:14,800 --> 02:44:19,560
here to stay some people may find it

3904
02:44:16,840 --> 02:44:22,240
easy to embrace a tender egalitarian

3905
02:44:19,560 --> 02:44:24,520
sensuality but I think for most people

3906
02:44:22,240 --> 02:44:26,840
versatility is as close to sexual

3907
02:44:24,520 --> 02:44:29,000
equality as it's possible to get the

3908
02:44:26,840 --> 02:44:31,319
receiver becomes the giver and The Giver

3909
02:44:29,000 --> 02:44:33,640
becomes the receiver and it all balances

3910
02:44:31,319 --> 02:44:36,399
out I'm not saying that perfect equality

3911
02:44:33,640 --> 02:44:38,279
is possible there's no sexual Utopia on

3912
02:44:36,399 --> 02:44:40,680
the horizon but equality through

3913
02:44:38,279 --> 02:44:43,680
versatility is an ideal we can strive

3914
02:44:40,680 --> 02:44:46,120
for like American democracy you know

3915
02:44:43,680 --> 02:44:48,160
it's a thing we say we believe in and

3916
02:44:46,120 --> 02:44:49,840
God bless us for trying for me

3917
02:44:48,160 --> 02:44:52,399
versatility is is less about some

3918
02:44:49,840 --> 02:44:54,720
ideology of sexual maoism that says we

3919
02:44:52,399 --> 02:44:56,359
have to abolish all hierarchy it's more

3920
02:44:54,720 --> 02:44:58,560
just that I think we all contain

3921
02:44:56,359 --> 02:45:01,279
masculine and feminine potential within

3922
02:44:58,560 --> 02:45:04,120
us and it's more satisfying to express

3923
02:45:01,279 --> 02:45:07,359
both unlike bisi in proletariat or

3924
02:45:04,120 --> 02:45:10,200
colonizer in colonized I see masculinity

3925
02:45:07,359 --> 02:45:13,000
and femininity as a duality inherent to

3926
02:45:10,200 --> 02:45:15,359
human existence this by the way is why

3927
02:45:13,000 --> 02:45:18,080
trans women and feminine men are not

3928
02:45:15,359 --> 02:45:20,240
appropriating Womanhood women is not an

3929
02:45:18,080 --> 02:45:23,040
ethnic group and masculinity and

3930
02:45:20,240 --> 02:45:26,359
femininity belong to all Humanity now am

3931
02:45:23,040 --> 02:45:29,359
I saying that gender is binary no gender

3932
02:45:26,359 --> 02:45:32,439
is not a binary in the sense of 01 but a

3933
02:45:29,359 --> 02:45:34,960
duality in the sense of Yin Yang yin and

3934
02:45:32,439 --> 02:45:37,640
yang are interpenetrating opposites that

3935
02:45:34,960 --> 02:45:40,880
constitute each other there is no Yang

3936
02:45:37,640 --> 02:45:43,720
without Yin giving implies receiving

3937
02:45:40,880 --> 02:45:46,640
there is no doer without a done to there

3938
02:45:43,720 --> 02:45:49,279
is no top without a bottom yin and yang

3939
02:45:46,640 --> 02:45:51,840
consume each other as Darkness grows

3940
02:45:49,279 --> 02:45:54,760
light shrinks they transform into each

3941
02:45:51,840 --> 02:45:57,760
other night becomes Day Day becomes

3942
02:45:54,760 --> 02:46:01,319
night they're infinitely divisible Yin

3943
02:45:57,760 --> 02:46:03,880
contains Yang Yang contains Yin men

3944
02:46:01,319 --> 02:46:06,359
contain femininity women contain

3945
02:46:03,880 --> 02:46:08,840
masculinity and you can keep subdividing

3946
02:46:06,359 --> 02:46:11,160
and transforming there's fem tops and

3947
02:46:08,840 --> 02:46:14,040
mask bottoms there's power bottoms and

3948
02:46:11,160 --> 02:46:16,520
service tops femininity is supposedly

3949
02:46:14,040 --> 02:46:19,080
passive but isn't there activity in such

3950
02:46:16,520 --> 02:46:22,279
feminine gestures as inviting seducing

3951
02:46:19,080 --> 02:46:24,080
in exhibiting deuring receptive is a

3952
02:46:22,279 --> 02:46:26,080
better word than passive because

3953
02:46:24,080 --> 02:46:28,920
receptivity can be its own form of

3954
02:46:26,080 --> 02:46:31,520
activity pseudo questions like how many

3955
02:46:28,920 --> 02:46:33,319
genders are there or slogans like two

3956
02:46:31,520 --> 02:46:36,319
genders or even the well-intentioned

3957
02:46:33,319 --> 02:46:38,080
idea that gender is a spectrum I see all

3958
02:46:36,319 --> 02:46:41,080
of these as symptomatic of a

3959
02:46:38,080 --> 02:46:43,840
misunderstanding of Duality yin and yang

3960
02:46:41,080 --> 02:46:45,800
mean dark side and Light Side there are

3961
02:46:43,840 --> 02:46:48,359
two genders in the sense that there are

3962
02:46:45,800 --> 02:46:50,680
two sides of a mountain The Sunny Side

3963
02:46:48,359 --> 02:46:53,000
and the sh side there's still shade on

3964
02:46:50,680 --> 02:46:55,399
the sunny side and light on the Shady

3965
02:46:53,000 --> 02:46:58,279
Side depending where the mountain is the

3966
02:46:55,399 --> 02:47:00,840
Shady Side might become the Sunny Side

3967
02:46:58,279 --> 02:47:04,479
there is no shade without light so in a

3968
02:47:00,840 --> 02:47:06,279
sense the binary is non-binary in a way

3969
02:47:04,479 --> 02:47:09,080
it would be equally true to say that

3970
02:47:06,279 --> 02:47:11,920
there is one gender the human gender

3971
02:47:09,080 --> 02:47:14,200
that has been split into two into three

3972
02:47:11,920 --> 02:47:16,120
into many because yin and yang are

3973
02:47:14,200 --> 02:47:19,399
mutually dependent they're both a

3974
02:47:16,120 --> 02:47:21,399
duality and a Unity yin yang

3975
02:47:19,399 --> 02:47:23,960
now you might object won't this sort of

3976
02:47:21,399 --> 02:47:26,200
thinking turn us into a nation of cucks

3977
02:47:23,960 --> 02:47:28,880
are you trying to destroy masculinity

3978
02:47:26,200 --> 02:47:31,120
are you trying to destroy the West no

3979
02:47:28,880 --> 02:47:33,560
I'm not trying to cuck the West okay I'm

3980
02:47:31,120 --> 02:47:35,439
not trying to turn anyone into cuckolds

3981
02:47:33,560 --> 02:47:38,479
I'm trying to bring the West into

3982
02:47:35,439 --> 02:47:40,520
harmony with the da is that so wrong is

3983
02:47:38,479 --> 02:47:42,880
it possible Twilight isn't even about

3984
02:47:40,520 --> 02:47:45,600
romance could this all be an allegory

3985
02:47:42,880 --> 02:47:47,880
for a more spiritual Quest if a romance

3986
02:47:45,600 --> 02:47:49,920
novel dramatizes the internal struggle

3987
02:47:47,880 --> 02:47:52,200
to integrate the masculine and feminine

3988
02:47:49,920 --> 02:47:54,160
elements of ourselves then Bella and

3989
02:47:52,200 --> 02:47:56,399
Edward are not just characters they're

3990
02:47:54,160 --> 02:47:58,800
projections of our inwardly conflicted

3991
02:47:56,399 --> 02:48:01,200
nature the predator and the prey The

3992
02:47:58,800 --> 02:48:04,080
Lion and the lamb the lover and the

3993
02:48:01,200 --> 02:48:06,479
Beloved how can these be reconciled in

3994
02:48:04,080 --> 02:48:09,000
the last chapter of Breaking Dawn Bella

3995
02:48:06,479 --> 02:48:11,720
opens to Edward not only her body but

3996
02:48:09,000 --> 02:48:14,200
her mind Edward's vampire power is that

3997
02:48:11,720 --> 02:48:17,000
he can read minds but Bella's is that

3998
02:48:14,200 --> 02:48:18,960
she can Shield herself from other powers

3999
02:48:17,000 --> 02:48:20,760
it's because Edward could not read her

4000
02:48:18,960 --> 02:48:23,479
mind that he fell in love with Bella

4001
02:48:20,760 --> 02:48:26,279
because desire needs a boundary it needs

4002
02:48:23,479 --> 02:48:28,840
separation but at the end Bella says I

4003
02:48:26,279 --> 02:48:30,800
knew my shield better now I understood

4004
02:48:28,840 --> 02:48:32,800
the part that fought against separation

4005
02:48:30,800 --> 02:48:35,120
from me the automatic instinct to

4006
02:48:32,800 --> 02:48:37,200
preserve self above all else and she

4007
02:48:35,120 --> 02:48:40,120
begins to lower her Shield letting

4008
02:48:37,200 --> 02:48:42,600
Edward into her mind Simone says the

4009
02:48:40,120 --> 02:48:45,200
Supreme aim of human love like mystical

4010
02:48:42,600 --> 02:48:48,800
love is identification with the loved

4011
02:48:45,200 --> 02:48:51,600
one when all barriers fall the two

4012
02:48:48,800 --> 02:48:54,000
become one as their minds begin to meld

4013
02:48:51,600 --> 02:48:56,240
Bella thinks we continued blissfully

4014
02:48:54,000 --> 02:48:58,560
into this small but perfect piece of our

4015
02:48:56,240 --> 02:49:00,880
forever now you could call that cheesy

4016
02:48:58,560 --> 02:49:03,359
romance writing but sometimes you get

4017
02:49:00,880 --> 02:49:05,520
out of art what you put into it so I

4018
02:49:03,359 --> 02:49:07,279
prefer to see Twilight as a bold

4019
02:49:05,520 --> 02:49:09,600
statement about the paradoxical

4020
02:49:07,279 --> 02:49:12,040
equivalence of Love and Death and

4021
02:49:09,600 --> 02:49:15,200
immortality the end of separation is the

4022
02:49:12,040 --> 02:49:19,359
end of Desire it's life it's death it's

4023
02:49:15,200 --> 02:49:20,730
Unity it is the absolute it's perfect

4024
02:49:19,359 --> 02:50:48,560
forever

4025
02:49:20,730 --> 02:50:50,480

4033
02:52:04,720 --> 02:52:09,040
future possibly getting on Twitter for

4038
02:52:15,160 --> 02:52:19,200
can you imagine going to the grocery

4039
02:52:16,880 --> 02:52:20,880
store buying lettuce I I just I think

4040
02:52:19,200 --> 02:52:22,479
it's I'm kind of a private person when

4041
02:52:20,880 --> 02:52:24,600
I'm and I just don't think that people

4042
02:52:22,479 --> 02:52:28,040
need to know my every little dumb

4043
02:52:24,600 --> 02:52:28,040
thought that passes through my head
