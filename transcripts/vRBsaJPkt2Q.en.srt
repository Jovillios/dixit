how are you cringe let's talk about it

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,789
the word cringe has taken over my

8
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,680
vocabulary lately it just pops into my

9
00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:25,140
head all the time like when I randomly

10
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:26,760
remember that month back in 2013 when

11
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:28,590
all of my facebook posts were just

12
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,990
lyrics to Ke$ha songs rewritten in

13
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:33,300
iambic pentameter why

14
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:36,059
what audience was that for who is this

15
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:38,879
inconceivable person I used to be cringe

16
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:39,809
mega cringe I think I say this word like

17
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:42,180
50 times a day

18
00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:44,040
cringe cringe cringe and I'm not the

19
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:45,780
only one Google Trends shows that in the

20
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:47,340
u.s. search interest in the word cringe

21
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:49,710
has dramatically increased over the last

22
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:51,449
decade peaking in 2016 and remaining

23
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:53,309
pretty constant ever since and if you

24
00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:55,410
look at worldwide trends search interest

25
00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:57,840
in cringe I said an all-time high the

26
00:00:55,410 --> 00:01:00,690
month I'm making this video so what is

27
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,640
cringe well let's start with some

28
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:05,129
examples there is a recent threat on ask

29
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,810
reddit titled what things really make

30
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:08,729
you cringe and here's some of the most

31
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:10,080
up voted responses the time I was

32
00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:11,909
talking too loud at a wedding when I

33
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,260
wasn't supposed to and everyone at the

34
00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:15,330
wedding turned around to see what

35
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:17,369
[ __ ] wouldn't shut up recordings of

36
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:19,830
my own voice when I remember that I did

37
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:22,650
that I do have a boyfriend he just goes

38
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:24,630
to another school thing early teen me so

39
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:26,580
many cringe stuff I did I hope all my

40
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:28,320
old friends have forgotten about me this

41
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:30,210
happened about two years ago I ordered

42
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,130
some pizza hutt online and when it was

43
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:34,710
delivered the lady handed me the pizza

44
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:37,409
boxes I said thanks and she told me my

45
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:38,729
shirt was inside-out I said oh and then

46
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:40,590
she hands me the receipt to sign and

47
00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:42,360
leave a tip and I spent 30 seconds

48
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:44,310
trying to get the pen to work she looks

49
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:47,369
at the pad and says you have to click

50
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:48,540
the pen I said oh and then she reaches

51
00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:50,790
to get the receipt and tells me the

52
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:52,350
pizza smells good then I said you'd see

53
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:54,509
oh and then I closed the door and killed

54
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:56,640
myself all of these responses illustrate

55
00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:58,469
exactly what writer Melissa Dahl says in

56
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,100
her book cringe-worthy a theory of

57
00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:01,380
awkwardness

58
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:03,180
according to Dahl the moments that make

59
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:05,130
us cringe are when were yanked out of

60
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:07,290
our own perspective and we can suddenly

61
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:09,300
see ourselves from somebody else's point

62
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:10,380
of view she quotes the anthropologist

63
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,210
Edmund

64
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:14,220
who in the 60s did a study of the bee

65
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:16,080
ami tribe in New Guinea where he showed

66
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:17,640
them mirror video and photographic

67
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,650
images of themselves for the first time

68
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:21,720
and described the results they were

69
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:23,580
paralyzed after their first startled

70
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,840
response covering their mouths and

71
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:27,120
ducking their heads they stood

72
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:29,010
transfixed staring at their images only

73
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,230
their stomach muscles betraying great

74
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:31,980
tension so basically they cringed it

75
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:33,990
themselves

76
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:35,970
maybe self-awareness always begins with

77
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:37,560
cringing like pretty much everyone seems

78
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:39,060
to hate the sound of their voice when

79
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,650
they hear a recording for the first time

80
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:42,120
I guess because it sounds different from

81
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:43,710
the way you hear it resonating in your

82
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:46,410
head so when you hear the recording you

83
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:48,090
realize oh god that's how other people

84
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:50,250
hear me all the time and you're suddenly

85
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:52,110
aware of this clash between the way you

86
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:53,910
appear to yourself and the way you

87
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:56,400
appear to other people that's when you

88
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:58,770
cringe the feeling doll describes as the

89
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,670
intense visceral reaction produced by an

90
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:01,950
awkward moment

91
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:03,900
an unpleasant kind of self recognition

92
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:06,360
where you suddenly see yourself through

93
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:08,310
someone else's eyes it's a forced moment

94
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:10,500
of self-awareness and it usually makes

95
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:12,240
you cognizant of the disappointing fact

96
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:14,400
that you aren't measuring up to your own

97
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:16,140
self-concept when you're talking too

98
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,550
loud at a wedding and suddenly Erwin

99
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:19,410
turns around to see what [ __ ]

100
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:21,750
wouldn't shut up you suddenly realize

101
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:23,730
how you look to them because we've all

102
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:25,020
at some point turned around to see what

103
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:27,780
[ __ ] wouldn't shut up

104
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:30,330
but this time you're the [ __ ] cringe

105
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:33,000
often it's the violation of an implicit

106
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:35,010
social norm that makes us cringe there's

107
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,560
no law of state or even of etiquette

108
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:39,030
that tells you exactly how loud you're

109
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,800
supposed to speak at a wedding it's

110
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:42,720
something you have to intuit based on

111
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:44,700
context how loud are other people

112
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,800
speaking is the ceremony about to begin

113
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:48,420
and we're all supposed to be quiet now

114
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:50,880
according to youtuber Vsauce Michael

115
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:51,750
here the function of awkwardness is that

116
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,760
it's sans

117
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:57,150
social dynamics by smoothing out what

118
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:59,400
even etiquette doesn't rule on cringe is

119
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:02,430
the electric shock the emotional

120
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:04,080
punishment for being awkward it enforces

121
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:06,720
the limits of socially acceptable

122
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,520
behavior by wounding the ego and

123
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,320
memories of your crunchy moments are

124
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:12,060
often just as painful as the moments

125
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:13,800
themselves 10 years later you'll be

126
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:16,230
trying to fall asleep and for no reason

127
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:18,090
at all your brain will decide to remind

128
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:20,010
you of that time you were talking too

129
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:21,750
loud at the wedding and of this stupid

130
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:23,090
thing you were saying when everyone

131
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:24,860
turned around to stare at you

132
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:26,720
and you'll cringe all over I got that's

133
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:28,490
why remembering your teenagers is so

134
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:31,430
painful because you look back and you

135
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:34,699
realize damn I was the [ __ ]

136
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:36,680
for like seven consecutive years can I

137
00:04:34,699 --> 00:04:38,800
just hire a hitman to kill everyone who

138
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:41,030
remembers me before I don't know

139
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,190
November no all the examples we've

140
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:45,380
considered so far involve self cringe

141
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:47,000
but usually when we talk about cringe on

142
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:49,130
the internet we're talking about

143
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,199
cringing at other people popular

144
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:53,690
subreddits like our slash cringe cringe

145
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:55,669
pics and cringe topia hosts videos and

146
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:57,889
images of people behaving in cringy ways

147
00:04:55,669 --> 00:04:59,600
for instance a maternity photo that

148
00:04:57,889 --> 00:05:01,910
looks like a hostage crisis grim moments

149
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,710
of lamentation and cuckold Rhee and Mitt

150
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:07,419
Romney attempting to communicate during

151
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:07,419
his first encounter with black people

152
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:13,760
watching that makes me feel like my soul

153
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,620
is on fire it makes me want to crawl out

154
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:17,870
of my body and escape into another

155
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:20,330
dimension I think some people feel

156
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:22,220
cringe more intensely than others for me

157
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:24,500
it's uncomfortable to the point where I

158
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:26,360
will reflexively pause a video like that

159
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:28,160
because I just can't stand it in other

160
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:30,350
words it's like watching my own YouTube

161
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,960
videos which sweaty if you put that [ __ ]

162
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:34,910
on I will leave the room so why is it

163
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,830
that cringing at other people hurts in

164
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:38,960
the same way as cringing at yourself

165
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:41,150
well one theory is that cringing at

166
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,889
other people is simply vicarious

167
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:44,990
embarrassment or secondhand

168
00:05:42,889 --> 00:05:46,820
embarrassment basically it's a form of

169
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:48,530
empathy when you cringe at someone

170
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:50,780
you're feeling the embarrassment that

171
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:52,130
they're feeling just as if if you watch

172
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:54,470
someone fall down the stairs

173
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:56,150
you might win so pathetically with their

174
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:58,010
pain but there's a problem with the

175
00:05:56,150 --> 00:06:00,260
vicarious embarrassment theory of cringe

176
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:02,360
or at least a complication which is that

177
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:04,849
in the purest examples of cringe the

178
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:06,020
person doing the cringy thing isn't

179
00:06:04,849 --> 00:06:07,970
feeling embarrassed

180
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:09,800
in fact often they're super confident

181
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:11,450
and it's actually their lack of self

182
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,100
awareness about their embarrassing

183
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:13,990
behavior

184
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:16,240
that makes you cringe like when a woman

185
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:18,100
posts a ridiculously over face tune to

186
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,050
picture of herself as if anyone's gonna

187
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:21,910
believe she looks like that or when a

188
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:23,860
man thinks he looks like a badass tough

189
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:26,110
guy when he actually looks like an

190
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:28,540
embarrassing dingus so in the internet

191
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:30,790
sense of the word cringe is not just if

192
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:32,920
I carries embarrassment someone tripping

193
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:35,290
and falling onstage is embarrassing and

194
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:37,120
I do feel embarrassed for her but she

195
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:40,450
knows it's embarrassing and she feels

196
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:42,040
embarrassed because you feel bad that I

197
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:44,530
fell and that's really embarrassing but

198
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:47,500
thank you nothing about this is cringe

199
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:48,790
maybe to her it's self cringe maybe she

200
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:51,730
looks back on it and it's still

201
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:53,140
embarrassing but I don't cringe at her

202
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:55,750
maybe there's a difference between

203
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:56,350
cringing at someone and cringing with

204
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:58,540
them

205
00:06:56,350 --> 00:07:00,400
when someone falls on stage I cringe

206
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:02,770
with her in the sense that I feel

207
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,300
vicarious embarrassment my feelings

208
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:06,880
mirror what she's feeling

209
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:08,500
but when I'm cringing at someone I'm

210
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,990
feeling something very different to what

211
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:13,480
they're feeling I'm cringing at captain

212
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:15,760
badass overhere because he doesn't have

213
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:18,130
the decency to cringe on himself

214
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:19,780
another example is bad American Idol

215
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:22,180
auditions which are quintessential

216
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:24,700
cringe content people try out for

217
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:26,350
American Idol because they think they're

218
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:27,940
good enough singers to compete in a

219
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:29,290
national competition so they're

220
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:31,210
effectively revealing their own

221
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:39,640
delusions when they show up and sing

222
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:42,130
like this it's not just that he's

223
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:44,110
terrible that makes it cringe most of us

224
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:46,060
are bad singers right when people sing

225
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:47,440
happy birthday at a party usually

226
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:49,420
they're singing in three different keys

227
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,100
at no particular tempo but that's not

228
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:53,020
cringe because the point of singing

229
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:55,300
happy birthday is not to sound amazing

230
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:57,760
bad American Idol auditions are cringe

231
00:07:55,300 --> 00:08:00,550
because of the contestants misplaced

232
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:03,700
confidence who you as good as in your

233
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:06,130
opinion the lead singer from Queen it's

234
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:08,320
the hubris of thinking you sound like

235
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:11,290
Freddie Mercury when in fact you sounds

236
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:15,669
like a wounded street dog

237
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:17,290
I admit that watching red I'm actually

238
00:08:15,669 --> 00:08:19,270
not in very much pain when I'm cringing

239
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:21,550
at him I laugh at his ludicrous

240
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:24,070
performance just like the judges do and

241
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:25,600
because he's so cocky and because he

242
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:27,550
doesn't show signs of embarrassment

243
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:29,979
himself there's a part of me that

244
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:32,349
actually kind of enjoys his failure

245
00:08:29,979 --> 00:08:34,510
there's almost a sense of Karma a sense

246
00:08:32,349 --> 00:08:36,820
that because of his tragic hubris he

247
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:38,740
deserves the humiliation he's bringing

248
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:41,080
upon himself and my sense that he

249
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:43,810
deserves it suppresses my compassionate

250
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:45,640
response and helps remove any guilt I

251
00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:47,589
might otherwise have about taking

252
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:49,660
pleasure in someone's humiliation

253
00:08:47,589 --> 00:08:51,880
contrast this with another Idol cringe

254
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:53,950
contestant Misha who's there with her

255
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:56,560
mom and they both seem like such

256
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:58,660
sweethearts I do believe in her a talent

257
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:00,760
that was very beautiful and yeah she's

258
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:03,130
delusional about her singing talent but

259
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:04,390
I'm rooting for her and when she

260
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:07,960
embarrasses herself

261
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:10,210
I feel no joy only deep and agonizing

262
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:14,170
cringe don't you wish your girlfriend

263
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:16,510
was hot like me yikes

264
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:18,910
my differing reactions to red and Misha

265
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:21,000
track a distinction that dole makes

266
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:23,770
between compassionate cringe and

267
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,470
contemptuous cringe compassionate cringe

268
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:28,330
involves an emotional identification

269
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:30,100
with the person you're cringing ah even

270
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:32,200
if they aren't embarrassed themselves in

271
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:34,420
the cringe-worthy moment you still feel

272
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:36,700
the embarrassment they would feel or

273
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:39,089
perhaps ought to feel if they were aware

274
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:41,290
of how other people were perceiving them

275
00:09:39,089 --> 00:09:44,020
contemptuous cringe on the other hand

276
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:45,820
involves an emotional distancing from

277
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:47,860
the person you're cringing on just like

278
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:49,390
with compassionate cringe you perceive

279
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:51,250
that the person is embarrassing

280
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:53,589
themselves but instead of feeling

281
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:55,089
embarrassment on their behalf you feel

282
00:09:53,589 --> 00:09:57,490
annoyance and disgust

283
00:09:55,089 --> 00:09:59,740
octa and maybe even a little shot in

284
00:09:57,490 --> 00:10:02,380
photo so these are actually two very

285
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:04,810
different emotional responses vicarious

286
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:07,000
embarrassment versus contempt we call

287
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:09,160
both feelings cringe not because there's

288
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,500
similar feelings but because their

289
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:12,900
responses to the same type of situation

290
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:14,440
people lacking self-awareness

291
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:17,200
embarrassing themselves without

292
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:19,480
realizing it now embarrassment and can

293
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,940
seem at face value like pretty

294
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:24,220
unpleasant feelings so why are we so

295
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:26,470
fascinated by content that makes us feel

296
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:28,240
this way why do these cringe subreddits

297
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:30,310
have more than a million members

298
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:32,800
why are cringe compilations and cringe

299
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:35,260
reaction videos so popular on YouTube

300
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:37,240
why does so much comedy feature cringy

301
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:39,190
situations well I think the answer to

302
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:40,779
that question depends on whether we're

303
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:42,700
cringing compassionately are

304
00:10:40,779 --> 00:10:44,320
contemptuously when I read that ask

305
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:46,000
reddit thread where all the people share

306
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,850
their cringe stories I cringe

307
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,980
compassionately that is I feel vicarious

308
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:52,839
embarrassment for them and with that

309
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:55,810
compassion comes a sense of solidarity

310
00:10:52,839 --> 00:10:58,420
and camaraderie with them I recognize

311
00:10:55,810 --> 00:11:00,490
myself in them and I'm reassured to hear

312
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:02,560
that other people are just as awkward

313
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:04,779
and embarrassing as I am I'm not the

314
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:06,790
only one who cringes up my past or in

315
00:11:04,779 --> 00:11:08,830
videos of myself I'm not the only one

316
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:10,690
who sometimes says you to when the

317
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:11,920
person says the pizza smells good when

318
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:14,410
we collectively laugh at these

319
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:16,779
situations we're bonding over our shared

320
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:18,790
human frailty we're recognizing that we

321
00:11:16,779 --> 00:11:20,890
all say the wrong things sometimes that

322
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:22,870
we've all arrogantly argued for an

323
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:26,170
opinion only to later educate ourselves

324
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:27,670
and realize how ignorant and wrong we

325
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:29,890
were that we've all tried to present

326
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:33,370
ourselves as cool and likable as

327
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:34,900
beautiful and talented badass only to

328
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:37,150
totally miss the mark and completely

329
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:39,880
embarrass ourselves and laughing at our

330
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:42,490
shared absurdity or insecurity or

331
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:44,680
ridiculous pretenses it makes us feel

332
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:46,030
less alone now this is all of course

333
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:48,220
assuming that we're cringing

334
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:51,850
compassionately but I would argue that

335
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:54,190
most cringe content on the Internet does

336
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:56,530
not encourage compassion and that's kind

337
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:58,360
of an uncomfortable thought because we

338
00:11:56,530 --> 00:12:00,970
like to think of ourselves as morally

339
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:03,370
evolved this is the 21st century right

340
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:06,430
Hillary's and freak shows and public

341
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:08,740
floggings these are barbaric practices

342
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:10,450
from the Dark Ages right surely no one

343
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:15,399
on the internet would ever entertain

344
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:18,560
themselves by humiliating people right

345
00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:21,320
we've got maniacs

346
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:24,200
we've got whackadoo we've got skit suits

347
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:27,140
fatties and spurs come seize sexual

348
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:29,899
deviants on display that's right folks

349
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:32,120
we've got cackling perverts and every

350
00:12:29,899 --> 00:12:34,339
denomination come see the panty sniffer

351
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:36,830
he'll stop at nothing to indulge his

352
00:12:34,339 --> 00:12:38,990
twisted cravings come see the skeleton

353
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:43,160
girl she hasn't had a bite in 30 days

354
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:45,200
that's right we've got real live lesbian

355
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:50,800
and I'll be your master of ceremonies

356
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:52,940
half man half woman all freaked okay

357
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:55,160
we've heard enough heartwarming

358
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:58,010
gibberish welcome to the dark side of

359
00:12:55,160 --> 00:13:00,110
crime watch here on youtube.com we have

360
00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:02,060
a cringe culture and by that I mean

361
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:04,580
there's whole channels making content

362
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:06,740
that centers the experience of cringing

363
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:09,440
and there's a huge audience that seeks

364
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:11,779
out cringe content including content the

365
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:13,520
creator didn't intend to be crammed much

366
00:13:11,779 --> 00:13:15,950
I first started paying attention to this

367
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:19,190
back in 2016 which was the heyday of the

368
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:21,680
feminist cringe compilation for SJW

369
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:23,600
cringe compilation remember those this

370
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:26,180
is ancient history by YouTube standards

371
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,830
but in 2016 the word cringe was most

372
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:30,320
associated with a youtuber called

373
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:32,720
leafyishere his videos followed the

374
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:34,400
format of a cringe reaction video which

375
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,650
means he would play someone else's

376
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:39,170
content then pause it to Rampton

377
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:41,120
voiceover about how cringe it is no I'll

378
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:44,570
make up with some sweatpants oh my god

379
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:46,400
it's so [ __ ] bad he looks like he's

380
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:49,190
gender-fluid he looks like a [ __ ]

381
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:51,620
lesbian this format of cringe reaction

382
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:54,140
videos was very influential and it was

383
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:55,910
picked up by a rational herd of a

384
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:58,579
skeptical beasts and free-thinking

385
00:13:55,910 --> 00:14:00,470
tuxedo what even is this thing it must

386
00:13:58,579 --> 00:14:03,140
be one of the 76 genders

387
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:05,270
I didn't realize [ __ ] was a gender

388
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:07,130
sorry my dudes you were on the cringe

389
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:10,250
side of history obviously there was a

390
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:12,170
political angle to SJW cringe videos the

391
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:14,630
logical antelope isn't inviting you to

392
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:16,310
foster a shared sense of humanity by

393
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:18,410
recognizing your own weakness in the

394
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:19,290
embarrassment of screeching feminists no

395
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:21,750
this isn't

396
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:24,029
invitation to contempt here's a youtube

397
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:26,220
video titled fat acceptance cringe

398
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:27,480
compilation you'd expect from the title

399
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:29,759
that it would be a video of fat

400
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:32,550
acceptance activists behaving in cringy

401
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:34,560
ways but it isn't it's literally just a

402
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:36,269
compilation of fat people doing things

403
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:39,480
this is just a clip of a fat woman

404
00:14:36,269 --> 00:14:42,060
swimming is this cringe what is cringe

405
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:43,860
about it earlier we defined cringe as

406
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:46,079
either vicarious embarrassment or

407
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:47,519
contempt for someone who lacks awareness

408
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:49,170
about the way others are perceiving them

409
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:52,170
but in this video of a swimming of fat

410
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:53,850
woman there's no context so we don't

411
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:55,589
know anything about her mental state and

412
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:56,910
we certainly don't know what that she's

413
00:14:55,589 --> 00:14:58,829
self-aware about how she's being

414
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:59,940
perceived if there is an interview where

415
00:14:58,829 --> 00:15:02,279
she talks about how she looks like a

416
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:04,500
supermodel or if she tried to Photoshop

417
00:15:02,279 --> 00:15:06,569
herself to look a good size for okay

418
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:08,579
maybe that would be cringe but that's

419
00:15:06,569 --> 00:15:12,329
not what's going on in this clip she's

420
00:15:08,579 --> 00:15:14,160
just existing in water what cringe

421
00:15:12,329 --> 00:15:16,620
are we being invited to feel over this

422
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:20,459
presumably something along the lines of

423
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:21,810
you fat people gross it's literally just

424
00:15:20,459 --> 00:15:23,730
disgust right

425
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:25,800
disgust and contempt for a type of

426
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:27,540
person a type of body

427
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:29,490
here's another cringe compilation this

428
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:31,230
one titled gender fluid non-binary

429
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:33,360
cringe and we're watching a young

430
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:34,889
teenager discuss their plans to start

431
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,350
blogging about their gender fluid

432
00:15:34,889 --> 00:15:40,620
identity honestly it's kind of

433
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:43,350
terrifying because you know like a

434
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:46,050
gender-fluid people just aren't accepted

435
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:47,850
yeah apparently not and judging from the

436
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:50,130
fact that I'm currently watching this in

437
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:52,019
a cringe compilation it's seamless that

438
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:54,149
the person in this video was dead-on

439
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:56,279
about how people would perceive them but

440
00:15:54,149 --> 00:15:59,910
despite that self-awareness we're being

441
00:15:56,279 --> 00:16:03,389
invited to cringe because I guess being

442
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:04,410
gender fluid like being fat is cringe in

443
00:16:03,389 --> 00:16:06,510
and of itself

444
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:08,130
now the pennant in me wants to oppose

445
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:10,529
this use of cringe

446
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:12,930
this is not real cringe I want to say

447
00:16:10,529 --> 00:16:15,329
cringe has to involve a clash between

448
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:17,519
self perception and perception by others

449
00:16:15,329 --> 00:16:19,829
but this usage of cringe as a mere

450
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:22,319
synonym for contempt is so widespread

451
00:16:19,829 --> 00:16:24,360
but there's really no point in objecting

452
00:16:22,319 --> 00:16:26,670
to it if you look at the banner image of

453
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:28,589
cringe topia one of the sleazier cringe

454
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:31,939

social outcasts there are types of

people who are widely ridiculed online

460
00:16:42,049 --> 00:16:46,429
I'd like to share with you a list that I

461
00:16:44,479 --> 00:16:49,339
put together of groups that are often

462
00:16:46,429 --> 00:16:53,269

471
00:17:11,329 --> 00:17:15,289
searching for some thread that all these

472
00:17:13,309 --> 00:17:17,990
groups have in common and a handful of

473
00:17:15,289 --> 00:17:20,299
themes do jump out deviancy whether

474
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:22,639
physical mental social or sexual a

475
00:17:20,299 --> 00:17:25,579
combination of passionate sincerity and

social status it's pretty easy to wind

480
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:36,470
up in the cringe category these days if

481
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:38,090
you add up all the groups on this list I

482
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:40,220
bet it includes most of the people

483
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:42,740
watching this video it includes me three

484
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:45,080

487
00:17:46,909 --> 00:17:53,210
we're all a bit cringe and try to be

488
00:17:49,159 --> 00:17:55,340
like compassionate or whatever [ __ ] no

489
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:56,809
the internet will not abide any of that

490
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:59,629
kumbaya [ __ ]

491
00:17:56,809 --> 00:18:02,509
oh no this is social reject battle

492
00:17:59,629 --> 00:18:04,879
royale clearly contemptuous cringing is

493
00:18:02,509 --> 00:18:07,399
rewarding to people in some way and I

494
00:18:04,879 --> 00:18:09,500
want to explore what the rewards might

495
00:18:07,399 --> 00:18:11,570
be let's start by looking at the rule of

496
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:14,090
cringe in internet politics where

497
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:16,100
manufacturing contempt is a powerful

498
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:18,679
strategy at the height of YouTube anti

499
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:21,799
feminism 2016 or so you couldn't escape

500
00:18:18,679 --> 00:18:23,720
clips of this woman known as big red a

501
00:18:21,799 --> 00:18:25,669
Toronto resident who showed up at a

502
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:27,529
men's rights event and read off a list

503
00:18:25,669 --> 00:18:32,360
of feminist theses while swearing

504
00:18:27,529 --> 00:18:33,279
profusely part of patriarchy I don't

505
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:35,419
know if you're noticing a theme

506
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:38,119
patriarchy I'm reading

507
00:18:35,419 --> 00:18:39,589
made mister entitled mr. Eagle

508
00:18:38,119 --> 00:18:41,119
patriarchy [ __ ] me

509
00:18:39,589 --> 00:18:43,339
she's one of these people who generates

510
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:44,690
nameable phrases at an amazing rate I

511
00:18:43,339 --> 00:18:47,299
actually think she's hilarious and

512
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:49,429
iconic but I have unconventional tastes

513
00:18:47,299 --> 00:18:51,409
Anastasia anyway this video appeared in

514
00:18:49,429 --> 00:18:54,109
callous cringe compilations reaction

515
00:18:51,409 --> 00:18:56,629
videos or remixes and even anti-feminist

516
00:18:54,109 --> 00:18:59,479
video essays often big read was framed

517
00:18:56,629 --> 00:19:02,359
as like Z feminist the mascot of

518
00:18:59,479 --> 00:19:04,159
feminism is sort of metonymic stand-in

519
00:19:02,359 --> 00:19:06,200
for all feminists which is highly

520
00:19:04,159 --> 00:19:08,239
dishonest considering she's not even a

521
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:10,039
high profile act of history thinker she

522
00:19:08,239 --> 00:19:11,749
was literally some random woman on the

523
00:19:10,039 --> 00:19:14,329
streets of Toronto but because of this

524
00:19:11,749 --> 00:19:16,309
amusing 12-minute video it was insisted

525
00:19:14,329 --> 00:19:18,579
upon that we all take a stand on this

526
00:19:16,309 --> 00:19:21,079
random woman who we were told

527
00:19:18,579 --> 00:19:24,739
exemplified feminism in its purest form

528
00:19:21,079 --> 00:19:27,469
I call this strategy mascot ization the

529
00:19:24,739 --> 00:19:29,149
construction of a strawman nemesis what

530
00:19:27,469 --> 00:19:32,089
you do is you select a cringe-worthy

531
00:19:29,149 --> 00:19:34,519
person and you appoint them the mascot

532
00:19:32,089 --> 00:19:36,799
of an opposing political team it's very

533
00:19:34,519 --> 00:19:39,079
simple but very effective and it's best

534
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:40,820
paired with Mema fication that's when

535
00:19:39,079 --> 00:19:43,729
you take a single moment in a person's

536
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:45,709
life you freeze it and you declare that

537
00:19:43,729 --> 00:19:48,679
that moment fully represents a person

538
00:19:45,709 --> 00:19:50,989
then through mascot ization you declare

539
00:19:48,679 --> 00:19:52,909
that this meme affined person represents

540
00:19:50,989 --> 00:19:54,829
an entire group or movement other

541
00:19:52,909 --> 00:19:59,269
right-wing memes from this era include

542
00:19:54,829 --> 00:19:59,929
this protester NEMA fight his aides and

543
00:19:59,269 --> 00:20:06,589
Skrillex

544
00:19:59,929 --> 00:20:09,169
and this protester who was Mima fide has

545
00:20:06,589 --> 00:20:11,149
trickly puffs the two of them symbolized

546
00:20:09,169 --> 00:20:13,909
the wretchedness of bethe new male

547
00:20:11,149 --> 00:20:16,489
cockle tree and the hysteria of social

548
00:20:13,909 --> 00:20:18,619
justice cry bullies respectively I guess

549
00:20:16,489 --> 00:20:20,839
the ultimate Mima fight mascot was Anita

550
00:20:18,619 --> 00:20:22,669
sarkeesian about whom hundreds of hours

551
00:20:20,839 --> 00:20:24,649
of salty gamer ramblings have been

552
00:20:22,669 --> 00:20:26,779
uploaded sometimes indeed it was

553
00:20:24,649 --> 00:20:30,049
caricatured as cringe as like this fake

554
00:20:26,779 --> 00:20:32,389
gamer girl this pleb tier cosmo throwing

555
00:20:30,049 --> 00:20:33,859
a pathetic tantrum at real gamers but

556
00:20:32,389 --> 00:20:36,639
other times it was almost a super

557
00:20:33,859 --> 00:20:39,320
villainous caricature this sort of dark

558
00:20:36,639 --> 00:20:41,419
devouring mother archetype threatening

559
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:43,129
to confiscate your videogames and engulf

560
00:20:41,419 --> 00:20:44,779
you and her eunuch abyss now it's

561
00:20:43,129 --> 00:20:47,450
obvious why caricature in your political

562
00:20:44,779 --> 00:20:49,309
enemies as supervillainess it

563
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:51,769
though it comes at the risk of

564
00:20:49,309 --> 00:20:54,049
backfiring by making your opponent seem

565
00:20:51,769 --> 00:20:56,989
a little bit too powerful a little too

566
00:20:54,049 --> 00:20:59,029
badass but the subtler strategy of

567
00:20:56,989 --> 00:21:01,099
symbolizing your political enemies not

568
00:20:59,029 --> 00:21:03,829
with an evil but with a cringe-worthy

569
00:21:01,099 --> 00:21:06,019
mascot works because it connects with a

570
00:21:03,829 --> 00:21:09,320
wide audience in an intense emotional

571
00:21:06,019 --> 00:21:11,029
way most people have a primal terror of

572
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:12,739
becoming the target of public ridicule

573
00:21:11,029 --> 00:21:15,289
and if someone has been made a

574
00:21:12,739 --> 00:21:16,729
laughingstock it's much safer to take

575
00:21:15,289 --> 00:21:18,829
the side of the people doing the

576
00:21:16,729 --> 00:21:21,859
laughing than it is to risk being

577
00:21:18,829 --> 00:21:24,289
laughed at yourself to be cringe is not

578
00:21:21,859 --> 00:21:26,809
to be in on the joke because people

579
00:21:24,289 --> 00:21:29,329
crave acceptance and dread rejection I

580
00:21:26,809 --> 00:21:32,389
think one reason we're so fascinated by

581
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:34,879
cringe content is that our brains want

582
00:21:32,389 --> 00:21:37,519
us to learn how to avoid being laughed

583
00:21:34,879 --> 00:21:40,009
at when we see a mob of people whether

584
00:21:37,519 --> 00:21:42,320
in person or online laughing at someone

585
00:21:40,009 --> 00:21:44,329
in ridiculing them we register an

586
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:47,539
emotional memory of it as a warning

587
00:21:44,329 --> 00:21:49,579
don't act like that or people will laugh

588
00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:51,349
at you this is a powerful tool for

589
00:21:49,579 --> 00:21:53,989
anyone who wants to control human

590
00:21:51,349 --> 00:21:56,059
behavior it's why public humiliation has

591
00:21:53,989 --> 00:21:58,129
in many societies been a punishment for

592
00:21:56,059 --> 00:22:01,039
criminals you see a person in the stocks

593
00:21:58,129 --> 00:22:03,379
in the pillory at the whipping post you

594
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:05,059
see the mob jeering and throwing rotten

595
00:22:03,379 --> 00:22:07,789
vegetables and it sends a powerful

596
00:22:05,059 --> 00:22:09,229
message don't do whatever that guy did I

597
00:22:07,789 --> 00:22:11,089
don't think the Internet has yet reached

598
00:22:09,229 --> 00:22:13,849
self-consciousness about the fact that

599
00:22:11,089 --> 00:22:16,009
the fear of public humiliation rules us

600
00:22:13,849 --> 00:22:18,079
like as the 17th century there's no

601
00:22:16,009 --> 00:22:20,599
judge sentencing people to a day in the

602
00:22:18,079 --> 00:22:22,729
stocks but instead there's teenage

603
00:22:20,599 --> 00:22:24,979
youtubers making cringe reaction videos

604
00:22:22,729 --> 00:22:27,109
there's ex-boyfriends revenge posting

605
00:22:24,979 --> 00:22:29,389
their girlfriends nudes this vigilante

606
00:22:27,109 --> 00:22:31,129
Twitter mobs harassing and shaming just

607
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:33,109
about anyone for alleged breaches of

608
00:22:31,129 --> 00:22:37,639
woke Ness public humiliation is a

609
00:22:33,109 --> 00:22:39,349
powerful force and it's usually it's not

610
00:22:37,639 --> 00:22:41,599
a good force but there are some rare

611
00:22:39,349 --> 00:22:43,849
exceptions back in the gamergate era

612
00:22:41,599 --> 00:22:46,249
gamergate itself of course being a study

613
00:22:43,849 --> 00:22:47,419
in public humiliation slut-shaming on a

614
00:22:46,249 --> 00:22:49,159
massive scale

615
00:22:47,419 --> 00:22:52,279
YouTube commentary was increasingly

616
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:53,839
dominated by anti feminism as far as

617
00:22:52,279 --> 00:22:55,999
leftist content there was the Young

618
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:57,919
Turks and there is a network of besieged

619
00:22:55,999 --> 00:22:59,170
feminists of loggers who were constantly

620
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:01,210
mobbed in her

621
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:04,210
what I see is one of the turning points

622
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:06,940
and shifting the atmosphere from the pro

623
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:09,940
gamergate days to the left tube world of

624
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:12,160
today was a handful of videos uploaded

625
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:14,020
by then obscure youtuber Harry Brewers

626
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:16,420
in which he mocked a misogynist

627
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:18,640
pseudo-intellectual called davis oriini

628
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:20,080
come on Davis we have to know stop

629
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,790
lecturing me about ethics we have to get

630
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:23,950
out of here and can you please stop

631
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:26,200
trying to start a forest fire in his

632
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:28,090
YouTube videos Davis would pontificate

633
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:29,860
about the wickedness of women while

634
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:32,230
posing in front of a toy skull and

635
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:37,210
taking microscopic sips from a glass of

636
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:39,250
whiskey men of the West women in our

637
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:42,040
culture have become the most decadent

638
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:45,549
[ __ ] since the fall of Rome and so in

639
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:48,669
discussing [ __ ] versus [ __ ] I would

640
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:51,299
start with the premise that all women

641
00:23:48,669 --> 00:23:51,299
are [ __ ]

642
00:23:56,410 --> 00:23:59,470
hairy's videos ridiculing Davis

643
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:01,870
attracted

644
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:04,299
of views and a fairly positive response

645
00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:06,730
even from a mostly male gamer audience

646
00:24:04,299 --> 00:24:09,340
who were overwhelmingly anti-feminist at

647
00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:11,230
the time why did these videos work with

648
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:13,299
this audience where so many others

649
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:16,120
didn't well I think it's because harry

650
00:24:13,299 --> 00:24:18,360
didn't moralistically call out divas for

651
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:21,460
being problematic or misogynistic

652
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:23,860
instead he simply drew attention to the

653
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:26,710
fact that Davis is a cringe-worthy

654
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:28,450
buffoon and Davis was a perfect target

655
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:29,440
because he truly is cringe in the

656
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:31,330
traditional sense

657
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:33,190
he had no self awareness about the fact

658
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:35,620
that pretty much everyone saw through

659
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:38,260
his absurd posturing as a badass tough

660
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:40,750
guy by day profoundly dark philosopher

661
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:43,330
by night we exist in a world with

662
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:45,580
feminized legislation I spoken to men

663
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:47,890
and boys who have told me that Harry's

664
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:50,080
videos inspired the beginning of a

665
00:24:47,890 --> 00:24:52,450
feminist awakening of them not just

666
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:55,030
because they cringed at Davis arena but

667
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:57,490
also because they recognized a little

668
00:24:55,030 --> 00:25:00,190
bit of Davis in themselves and they

669
00:24:57,490 --> 00:25:02,169
cringed at that too recognising part of

670
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:04,780
yourself in a cringe-worthy person

671
00:25:02,169 --> 00:25:06,490
induces self scrimmage which can

672
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:08,919
motivate you to change your behavior

673
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:11,380
your beliefs or even your own

674
00:25:08,919 --> 00:25:14,230
self-concept and it helps that Davis is

675
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:16,480
a perfect instance of a recognizable

676
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:19,059
stock character on the Internet namely

677
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:21,400
the fedora tipper basically a man who

678
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:23,289
poses as a gallant crusader for

679
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:25,510
traditional masculinity but who's

680
00:25:23,289 --> 00:25:26,169
basically just a pasty nerd who can't

681
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:28,240
relate to women

682
00:25:26,169 --> 00:25:30,340
Davis was such an extreme version of

683
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:32,470
this and he delivered unintentionally

684
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:34,750
hilarious moments so frequently that I

685
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:38,380
would classify him as what the internet

686
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:40,059
calls a low cow low cow is old 4chan

687
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:41,980
lingo it means a person who's

688
00:25:40,059 --> 00:25:45,669
unintentionally eccentric or foolish

689
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:48,220
behavior can be milked for lulz milking

690
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:50,260
in this context can mean simply watching

691
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:52,240
a locales behavior and laughing at them

692
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:54,580
or it can mean making reaction videos

693
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:56,770
where you make fun of them or it can

694
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:58,780
mean actively trolling and provoking

695
00:25:56,770 --> 00:26:01,179
them to get a response that you find

696
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:03,460
entertaining I described Harry's videos

697
00:26:01,179 --> 00:26:05,670
about Davis or my old videos about the

698
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:08,040
golden one as law cow

699
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:10,350
content with a political angle it was

700
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:12,420
essentially an argument from ridicule an

701
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:14,460
argument from cringe with the aim of

702
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:17,040
convincing people don't embarrass

703
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:20,850
yourself like these ding-dongs but also

704
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:24,090
don't just speak for myself Here I am at

705
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:25,980
the end of the day an entertainer and I

706
00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:27,570
wanted people to laugh there doesn't

707
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:30,330
need to be a political agenda behind

708
00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:32,760
milking raw cows in fact usually there

709
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:34,740
isn't the purest example of a locale I

710
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:36,960
can think of is actually someone from

711
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:40,020
way before the internet namely Florence

712
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:42,540
Foster Jenkins Jenkins or Lady Florence

713
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:44,640
as she likes to be called was an

714
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:46,530
American soprano who attracted a cult

715
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:49,410
following in New York City during the

716
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:51,270
1920s 30s and 40s due to her being such

717
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:53,760
a terrible singer that people went to

718
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:56,010
her concerts essentially for the lolz

719
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:59,340
she was described as the world's worst

720
00:26:56,010 --> 00:27:01,440
opera singer no one before or since has

721
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:03,360
succeeded in liberating themselves quite

722
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:06,660
so completely from the shackles of

723
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:08,940
musical notation behold this [ __ ]

724
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:10,740
camp Queen but we have no choice but to

725
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:18,840
Stan here's a short clip of one of the

726
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:21,540
few recordings she made cringe she was

727
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:23,880
essentially the Tommy Wiseau the William

728
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:26,280
Mahone of her age apparently she was

729
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:29,850
oblivious to her own incompetence until

730
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:32,280
1944 when she was 76 years old and she

731
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:34,530
booked Carnegie Hall for a concert to

732
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:36,510
which newspaper critics showed up the

733
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:38,550
next morning the New York Sun reported

734
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:40,980
much of her singing was hopelessly

735
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:42,690
lacking any semblance of pitch but the

736
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:45,120
further a note was from its proper

737
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:47,910
elevation the more the audience laughed

738
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:50,070
and applauded and five days later she

739
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:51,900
had a heart attack and died I find

740
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:53,370
something very touching about this story

741
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:54,720
I mean I'd probably be laughing as much

742
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:56,880
as anyone if I were at Carnegie Hall

743
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:58,590
that night but I feel so much

744
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:00,750
compassionate cringe for Lady Florence

745
00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:02,820
it kind of makes you appreciate the kind

746
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:04,530
cruelty of Simon Cowell at least he

747
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:05,340
tries to stop these people before things

748
00:28:04,530 --> 00:28:06,960
get out of hand

749
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:09,180
I think it's normal to have mixed

750
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:11,360
feelings about a little cow like yes

751
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:14,610
this is hilarious but on the other hand

752
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:16,290
does not a low-cal bleed on some level

753
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:17,290
we know it's wrong to entertain

754
00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:20,080
ourselves this way

755
00:28:17,290 --> 00:28:22,330
but on the other hand other people's

756
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:24,310
pain is incredibly entertaining there's

757
00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:24,910
a good bug about this called the joy of

758
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:26,500
pain

759
00:28:24,910 --> 00:28:28,600
schadenfreude ah in the dark side of

760
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:30,220
human nature by Richard Smith

761
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:31,600
schadenfreude ax is of course the

762
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:33,610
pleasure we take in other people's

763
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:36,370
misery in Smith argues that we

764
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:38,410
experience it because psychologically we

765
00:28:36,370 --> 00:28:40,930
gain something when other people lose

766
00:28:38,410 --> 00:28:43,510
for constantly evaluating our own worth

767
00:28:40,930 --> 00:28:46,060
by comparing ourselves to other people

768
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:49,150
so we get a reassuring self-esteem boost

769
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:51,220
a pleasant feeling of superiority from

770
00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:54,040
comparing ourselves to people beneath us

771
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:57,070
especially if were kind of insecure to

772
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:59,440
begin with maybe I'm not perfect but at

773
00:28:57,070 --> 00:29:01,570
least I'm not this law cow and we also

774
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:04,750
get a boost when people who are socially

775
00:29:01,570 --> 00:29:08,650
above us whom we Envy get brought down a

776
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:11,170
peg James Charles is canceled party lol

777
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:13,810
oh wow I think schadenfreude up

778
00:29:11,170 --> 00:29:15,730
basically accounts for just a huge

779
00:29:13,810 --> 00:29:18,900
percentage of the things that happen on

780
00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:21,880
youtube.com Smith uses the word humility

781
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:24,160
menteur this type of media like reality

782
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:26,380
TV shows designed to produce spectacular

783
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:29,320
moments of embarrassment YouTube is

784
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:32,230
basically a big reality TV show or some

785
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:33,160
kind of carnival sideshow I mean take a

786
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:35,530
look around you

787
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:37,240
we have Eugenia Cooney a youtuber who at

788
00:29:35,530 --> 00:29:39,130
the time I'm making this video remains

789
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:41,020
apparently in total denial about her

790
00:29:39,130 --> 00:29:42,820
eating disorder and continues to make

791
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:44,560
videos modeling skimpy clothes for

792
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:47,080
millions of Gawker's we have wings of

793
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:49,180
redemption a bad-tempered gamer who for

794
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:51,460
a long time was essentially confined by

795
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:53,350
poverty obesity and depression to

796
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:54,760
streaming video games all day to an

797
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:57,160
audience of trolls that enjoyed

798
00:29:54,760 --> 00:30:00,520
tormenting him we have Onision

799
00:29:57,160 --> 00:30:02,290
a habitual alleged abuser of women and

800
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:04,810
teenage girls who earlier this year

801
00:30:02,290 --> 00:30:07,000
essentially performed his own mental

802
00:30:04,810 --> 00:30:08,800
breakdown on YouTube after patreon

803
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:16,150
banned him for dogs again accuser

804
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:18,220
I love kombucha this idea was it to give

805
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:20,320
hundreds of pathological narcissists

806
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:22,990
access to video equipment what kind of

807
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:25,150
sick social experiment are we living it

808
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:27,520
and the viewers are no better than the

809
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:29,200
performers every one of you blood

810
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:32,080
they're Stephenville yours makes me sick

811
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:34,570
oh you people love nothing more than to

812
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:36,760
watch one of us poor helpless egomaniacs

813
00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:41,560
completely lose our minds live on camera

814
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:43,060
is this what you want huh you wanna know

815
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:44,830
Wow

816
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:47,920
you know as a creator you have to be

817
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:50,080
aware that you're a circus performer and

818
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:52,090
the crowd may in fact be more

819
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:54,310
entertained if you fall from the trapeze

820
00:30:52,090 --> 00:30:57,130
and get used by the Tigers online media

821
00:30:54,310 --> 00:31:00,370
today is full of lady Florence's anti

822
00:30:57,130 --> 00:31:01,960
celebrities with anti fans now to be

823
00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:04,660
clear I don't think there's anything

824
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:05,710
inherently wrong with indulging now and

825
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:08,140
then in a little bit of light

826
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:10,750
contaminant cringing at davis oriini or

827
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:13,480
bad American Idol auditions seems pretty

828
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:15,520
harmless but it can be taken too far and

829
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:18,070
there's no better case study of taking

830
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:21,700
it too far than the cult following of

831
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:23,260
one Christine Weston Chandler if you

832
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:26,500
don't know what's coming you might want

833
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:29,740
to strop engorge cuz this is coconuts

834
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:31,800
it's bananas it's a full fruit salad God

835
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:35,920
how do I even begin to explain this

836
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:37,450
well Christine Weston Chandler more

837
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:42,670
commonly known on the Internet as

838
00:31:37,450 --> 00:31:45,100
Christian is the victim of what is quite

839
00:31:42,670 --> 00:31:48,340
possibly the longest-running and most

840
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:51,580
obsessive internet trolling saga of all

841
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:53,380
time she's the low cow of low cows

842
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:54,940
hello everybody's just Christine

843
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:57,460
Chandler coming to you live from home

844
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:59,530
once again Chandler is an autistic trans

845
00:31:57,460 --> 00:32:01,660
woman and yes I will be calling her by

846
00:31:59,530 --> 00:32:03,430
she/her pronouns which I paused to

847
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:05,530
explain because I don't think I've ever

848
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:07,930
seen anyone actually take her transition

849
00:32:05,530 --> 00:32:10,660
seriously most people seem to regard it

850
00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:12,670
as simply another absurd symptom of her

851
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:14,170
hilarious mental condition in fact a

852
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:17,020
bunch of trans people will probably get

853
00:32:14,170 --> 00:32:19,780
real salty with me for making trans

854
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:23,320
people's look bad by including Christian

855
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:26,350
in our o very prestigious and exclusive

856
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:28,900
club oh please transsexualism is a

857
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:31,570
deviant sexual identity sweaty this is

858
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:33,520
not the Princeton alumni Yacht Society

859
00:32:31,570 --> 00:32:37,870
God how did [ __ ] get so snobbish

860
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:38,830
look is Christian really trans I don't

861
00:32:37,870 --> 00:32:41,710
know

862
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:42,399
and I don't care if Christian wants to

863
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:45,460
be a woman

864
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:47,140
I for one support her journey but it

865
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:49,149
doesn't matter the relevant thing about

866
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:51,909
Christian is not Christian

867
00:32:49,149 --> 00:32:55,029
it's the fact that for the last 13 years

868
00:32:51,909 --> 00:32:58,120
nearly every aspect of her life has been

869
00:32:55,029 --> 00:33:01,000
obsessively archived online by thousands

870
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:03,940
of new years known as Chris Torian

871
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:06,419
Chandler first acquired this anti fandom

872
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:09,250
several Internet centuries ago back in

873
00:33:06,419 --> 00:33:11,649
2007 when a 4chan took notice of her

874
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:14,260
comic book series sonichu they

875
00:33:11,649 --> 00:33:17,460
childishly drawn hybrid with Sonic and

876
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:20,409
Pikachu the comic is sent in quick Phil

877
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:22,360
CWC being Christians initials the

878
00:33:20,409 --> 00:33:24,370
protagonist is a self-insert who

879
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:27,399
references Chandler's real-life quote

880
00:33:24,370 --> 00:33:29,350
love quest to find a quote boyfriend

881
00:33:27,399 --> 00:33:31,899
free girl which apparently involved

882
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:34,210
posting bizarre attraction science

883
00:33:31,899 --> 00:33:35,740
around her Community College for this

884
00:33:34,210 --> 00:33:37,870
storage makes sense you have to keep in

885
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:41,350
mind the Chandler identified and

886
00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:43,990
presented as male until 2015 so these

887
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:47,110
trolls saw her as like the ultimate

888
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:48,519
autistic in sell lamb Charlotte just to

889
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:51,250
give you a feel for this person

890
00:33:48,519 --> 00:33:53,740
here's Christine in 2018 holding up the

891
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:55,480
iconic pre-transition portrait with the

892
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:57,970
sonichu medallions here's the bedroom

893
00:33:55,480 --> 00:34:01,380
she lived in and here she is in recent

894
00:33:57,970 --> 00:34:03,940
years giving us a full BroNYCon eleganza

895
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:06,250
pegasisters snubbed basically she's the

896
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:09,159
entire cringe topia subreddit condensed

897
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:10,929
into a single person so fortunes erode

898
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:13,149
radiant on this [ __ ] because of course

899
00:34:10,929 --> 00:34:15,190
they did and they began tormenting her

900
00:34:13,149 --> 00:34:18,550
by creating pornographic parodies of

901
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:20,830
sonichu posting candid photos of her etc

902
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:22,899
Chandler reacted to the trolls which of

903
00:34:20,830 --> 00:34:25,119
course encouraged some more and the

904
00:34:22,899 --> 00:34:26,770
harassment escalated and escalated they

905
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:29,290
hacked her accounts or tricked her into

906
00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:31,389
giving out passwords they posted all her

907
00:34:29,290 --> 00:34:33,369
emails online these showed up in person

908
00:34:31,389 --> 00:34:34,089
and photographed her house they called

909
00:34:33,369 --> 00:34:36,369
her parents

910
00:34:34,089 --> 00:34:38,740
posing as friends psychiatrists

911
00:34:36,369 --> 00:34:40,869
journalists employers in order to

912
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:43,000
extract as much information about her as

913
00:34:40,869 --> 00:34:44,889
possible and of course they contacted

914
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,260
Chandler herself which was very

915
00:34:44,889 --> 00:34:48,810
rewarding for sure

916
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:50,580
because she has no filter and was very

917
00:34:48,810 --> 00:34:53,159
naive and trusting so she was very

918
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:55,800
willing to divulge or easily manipulated

919
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:58,790
into divulging mortifying information

920
00:34:55,800 --> 00:35:01,230
about herself sexual psychological

921
00:34:58,790 --> 00:35:03,570
scatological there's not really any

922
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:05,340
limits or boundaries to this for all the

923
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:07,590
information they gathered the trolls

924
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:10,410
created a wiki called the quickie

925
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:13,320
devoted to the obsessive compiling of

926
00:35:10,410 --> 00:35:16,020
all Christian data it includes a

927
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:17,880
detailed diagram of her bedroom entire

928
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:20,520
articles about all members of her

929
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:22,590
immediate and extended family pages of

930
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:24,900
psychiatric records she was tricked into

931
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:27,810
sending them and that's only the

932
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:30,320
beginning in their more grandiose moods

933
00:35:27,810 --> 00:35:33,570
the Cris torian's have speculated that

934
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:36,500
Christian is the most documented life in

935
00:35:33,570 --> 00:35:39,360
all human history comparing their social

936
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:42,030
experiment to The Truman Show it's a

937
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:44,940
level of obsession that surpasses the

938
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:49,580
wildest excesses of Stan culture it's a

939
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:52,440
gaze into the abyss that does not blink

940
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:54,480
some trolls have also sent taunting

941
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:57,030
letters and packages or on one occasion

942
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:59,100
sex workers to the Chandler household

943
00:35:57,030 --> 00:36:01,430
two female trolls actually went on

944
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:03,900
real-life dates with Christian of course

945
00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:06,570
secretly wearing wires to record their

946
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:08,460
conversations others pretended to be her

947
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:11,160
Internet girlfriends so they could

948
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:14,040
solicit and post nudes and masturbation

949
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:15,440
videos these things must be archived

950
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:18,480
don't you understand

951
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:21,360
Christian must be documented the

952
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:24,270
absolute low point came when some trolls

953
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:27,000
encouraged a thirteen-year-old boy to

954
00:36:24,270 --> 00:36:29,550
pose as a 19 year old girl and have

955
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:32,910
phone sex with Christian and recorded in

956
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:35,400
other words they groomed a child to

957
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:37,140
deceive an autistic person into

958
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:40,080
performing sex acts for their

959
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:42,110
entertainment now to contemporary Chris

960
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:44,340
torian's this sort of sadistic

961
00:36:42,110 --> 00:36:46,500
interference and Christine's life is

962
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:49,140
frowned upon not so much because it's

963
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:50,770
immoral so much as because it's

964
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:53,910
considered a bit tacky

965
00:36:50,770 --> 00:36:56,800
a bit attention-seeking no to the

966
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:59,050
sophisticated Chris Torian feat real

967
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:02,950
pleasure in all this is supposed to lie

968
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:06,340
and quietly spectating savoring the fine

969
00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:08,110
notes of cringe now I take it I don't

970
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:11,790
even need to comment on the morality of

971
00:37:08,110 --> 00:37:15,280
all this the real question to me is why

972
00:37:11,790 --> 00:37:17,950
why do thousands of people have a morbid

973
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:20,230
obsession with Christine Chandler and

974
00:37:17,950 --> 00:37:22,630
yes it is an obsession just to give you

975
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:25,330
a sense of a single individuals personal

976
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:27,970
investment in this the youtuber Gino

977
00:37:25,330 --> 00:37:30,760
Samuel one of very few Chris torian's

978
00:37:27,970 --> 00:37:33,640
with the audacity to show his face has

979
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:36,340
been working for more than two years to

980
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:39,220
produce an eventual 100 episode

981
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:42,010
documentary series about the life of

982
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:44,770
Christian Gino has completed 36 episodes

983
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:46,330
so far and each episode is around 40

984
00:37:44,770 --> 00:37:49,600
minutes long meaning he's already

985
00:37:46,330 --> 00:37:52,180
produced around 24 hours of video about

986
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:54,040
the life of what is essentially a random

987
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:56,410
stranger I think this phenomenon

988
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:59,620
deserves its own name I'll call it

989
00:37:56,410 --> 00:38:02,020
morbid cringe defined as an obsessive

990
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:05,110
and addictive contemptuous fascination

991
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:07,960
with a particular person or group why

992
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:09,790
does morbid cringe happen well I've

993
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:11,620
spent some time poring over Chris

994
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:13,990
torian's conversations with each other

995
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:16,450
and I've even interrogated a couple of

996
00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:17,740
them and this is what I've found the

997
00:38:16,450 --> 00:38:19,120
first thing they'll tell you is that

998
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:21,340
they just think it's funny and

999
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:23,920
entertaining that Christine's strange

1000
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:26,110
life and mind simply appeals to their

1001
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:29,230
morbid curiosity and I'm sure that's

1002
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:31,270
true but a lot of things are funny and

1003
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:35,200
entertaining and morbidly interesting

1004
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:37,060
why fixate on this particular person

1005
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:39,730
well for a lot of them it's a

1006
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:42,280
reassurance that there's someone out

1007
00:38:39,730 --> 00:38:44,740
there worse than them maybe they're

1008
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:46,810
nerdy loners with no social skills but

1009
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:49,150
at least this defenseless punching bag

1010
00:38:46,810 --> 00:38:51,550
called Christian is here for them to

1011
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:53,980
assert their superiority over it's

1012
00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:56,230
pretty much common knowledge that a lot

1013
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:58,260
of Chris torian's including some of the

1014
00:38:56,230 --> 00:39:01,360
most vocal haters are autistic

1015
00:38:58,260 --> 00:39:03,099
themselves and a frequent justification

1016
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:06,069
given for trolling Chris

1017
00:39:03,099 --> 00:39:08,650
is that she's giving autistics a bad

1018
00:39:06,069 --> 00:39:11,259
name in recent years there has also been

1019
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:14,680
a small contingent of transgender trolls

1020
00:39:11,259 --> 00:39:17,140
who are likewise prone to say he's not a

1021
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:22,839
real transgender like me and he's making

1022
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:26,109
us all look bad oh yeah because people

1023
00:39:22,839 --> 00:39:27,279
who troll Christian you guys look

1024
00:39:26,109 --> 00:39:29,430
amazing

1025
00:39:27,279 --> 00:39:31,930
it's common for trolls to offer

1026
00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:35,109
rationalizations like this about why

1027
00:39:31,930 --> 00:39:38,589
trolling Chandler is justified righteous

1028
00:39:35,109 --> 00:39:41,650
even because at the end of the day

1029
00:39:38,589 --> 00:39:43,719
trolls are people too and a lot of them

1030
00:39:41,650 --> 00:39:46,539
actually do have a guilty conscience

1031
00:39:43,719 --> 00:39:49,690
about this which they suppress by

1032
00:39:46,539 --> 00:39:50,259
insisting that Christian is a horrible

1033
00:39:49,690 --> 00:39:52,869
person

1034
00:39:50,259 --> 00:39:55,329
who deserves to be tormented but trolls

1035
00:39:52,869 --> 00:39:58,209
who protests too much about the evils of

1036
00:39:55,329 --> 00:40:00,670
Christian and therefore reveal the

1037
00:39:58,209 --> 00:40:03,339
access of their emotional investment in

1038
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:06,819
this are known in the community as a

1039
00:40:03,339 --> 00:40:09,369
logs a log is the name of a troll who

1040
00:40:06,819 --> 00:40:11,699
attracted the ire of other trolls by

1041
00:40:09,369 --> 00:40:15,039
ranting about Christians crimes

1042
00:40:11,699 --> 00:40:18,219
comparing her to Hitler and generally

1043
00:40:15,039 --> 00:40:20,709
betraying a pathological hate obsession

1044
00:40:18,219 --> 00:40:22,869
among the trolls this kind of behavior

1045
00:40:20,709 --> 00:40:25,809
is considered an embarrassment to all of

1046
00:40:22,869 --> 00:40:28,989
them because they want to feel like

1047
00:40:25,809 --> 00:40:32,019
they're just cruelly and casually toying

1048
00:40:28,989 --> 00:40:36,299
with this person you know just for

1049
00:40:32,019 --> 00:40:41,500
laughs not a big deal this is all

1050
00:40:36,299 --> 00:40:46,690
perfectly healthy and normal and fine

1051
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:49,330
it's fine but a log gave the lie to that

1052
00:40:46,690 --> 00:40:52,570
illusion because it was obvious that his

1053
00:40:49,330 --> 00:40:56,080
Christian obsession wasn't healthy or

1054
00:40:52,570 --> 00:40:58,090
normal or fine so the other trolls

1055
00:40:56,080 --> 00:41:00,910
turned on a log and they made him into

1056
00:40:58,090 --> 00:41:03,670
Christian 2.0 and they uncovered his

1057
00:41:00,910 --> 00:41:06,940
autism in his furry porn collection and

1058
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:09,220
his cringy erotic fan fiction so why

1059
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:11,980
would someone as similar to Christian as

1060
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:15,340
a log obsessively hate on her well

1061
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:17,530
there's two explanations one is troll

1062
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:19,810
shielding that is a log may have

1063
00:41:17,530 --> 00:41:21,850
performative Lea despised Christian and

1064
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:24,280
spearheaded the trolling efforts in

1065
00:41:21,850 --> 00:41:26,860
order to protect himself from being

1066
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:29,290
targeted by trolls the idea is that you

1067
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:31,530
can protect yourself from the mob by

1068
00:41:29,290 --> 00:41:34,750
waving your pitchfork the hardest

1069
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:38,130
obviously this did not work the other

1070
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:41,430
explanation is that a log saw himself

1071
00:41:38,130 --> 00:41:43,810
reflected in Christian and sort of

1072
00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:46,930
projected his own shame and

1073
00:41:43,810 --> 00:41:49,180
self-contempt onto her a log hated

1074
00:41:46,930 --> 00:41:52,750
Christian because he saw part of himself

1075
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:55,180
in her and the other trolls hated a log

1076
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:58,030
because they saw a part of themselves in

1077
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:59,620
him to quote Margaret Plus who covered

1078
00:41:58,030 --> 00:42:02,140
this story for New York magazine a few

1079
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:04,600
years ago I think it might be a logs all

1080
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:06,850
the way down people form morbid cringe

1081
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:09,070
obsessions with Christian because to

1082
00:42:06,850 --> 00:42:11,170
them she's a symbol of something they

1083
00:42:09,070 --> 00:42:13,300
hate about themselves something they're

1084
00:42:11,170 --> 00:42:15,670
ashamed of maybe it's being on the

1085
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:17,590
autism spectrum or being a socially

1086
00:42:15,670 --> 00:42:19,060
awkward recluse maybe it's being

1087
00:42:17,590 --> 00:42:22,420
unemployed and living with their parents

1088
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:24,940
or an adulthood fixation on children's

1089
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:28,030
cartoons or embarrassing sexual

1090
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:30,850
proclivities or all of the above this is

1091
00:42:28,030 --> 00:42:33,600
how scapegoating works right you repress

1092
00:42:30,850 --> 00:42:36,370
your uncomfortable feelings of shame and

1093
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:39,700
insecurity and self-loathing and you

1094
00:42:36,370 --> 00:42:42,310
displace them on to someone else usually

1095
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:45,090
someone you can feel superior to then

1096
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:47,800
you blame and persecute the scapegoat

1097
00:42:45,090 --> 00:42:50,710
transforming your painful shame and

1098
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:53,050
self-loathing and to pleasant judgmental

1099
00:42:50,710 --> 00:42:55,330
self-righteousness it's pretty safe to

1100
00:42:53,050 --> 00:42:57,640
assume that a large percentage

1101
00:42:55,330 --> 00:42:59,860
of Chris torian's and trolls are some

1102
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:03,130
kind of social outcasts much like

1103
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:05,920
Christian so bonding together over their

1104
00:43:03,130 --> 00:43:08,470
shared contempt for Christian is a way

1105
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:10,960
of processing the shame and anxiety of

1106
00:43:08,470 --> 00:43:13,180
social rejection and exclusion and I

1107
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:14,710
think for a lot of people even normal

1108
00:43:13,180 --> 00:43:17,080
people who aren't part of a bizarre

1109
00:43:14,710 --> 00:43:19,420
internet stalker community contemptuous

1110
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:22,360
cringing helps us cope with our own

1111
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:24,190
shame and insecurities anyway it's time

1112
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:26,380
to stop this tedious empathizing with

1113
00:43:24,190 --> 00:43:28,980
other people and find a way to make this

1114
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:28,980
all about me

realness nah he's gonna stay right here

1122
00:44:09,970 --> 00:44:14,619
is a grim reminder of the things that

1123
00:44:12,279 --> 00:44:15,220
you have seen actually I identify as a

1124
00:44:14,619 --> 00:44:16,359
trap

1125
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:18,789
it's very thought I guess that's not

1126
00:44:16,359 --> 00:44:21,400
really cringe if I'm trying to be cringe

1127
00:44:18,789 --> 00:44:24,010
cringes failed seriousness in my last

1128
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:27,130
video I talked about how ashamed I am of

1129
00:44:24,010 --> 00:44:29,109
being a transgender lesbian cringe shame

1130
00:44:27,130 --> 00:44:31,750
at the end of that video I talked about

1131
00:44:29,109 --> 00:44:34,480
how I sense that my shame is related to

1132
00:44:31,750 --> 00:44:36,760
the contemptuous cringe I feel for a lot

1133
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:38,500
of other trans lesbians particularly

1134
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:41,200
those of the HEC and straight beasts on

1135
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:43,390
yah yah cat girl variety but I confess

1136
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:46,750
to periodically sinking into these

1137
00:44:43,390 --> 00:44:48,880
morbid guilty binges of cringing at

1138
00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:50,380
embarrassing trans lesbians I want to

1139
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:52,450
return to that thought and kind of

1140
00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:54,670
psychoanalyze myself as a kind of

1141
00:44:52,450 --> 00:44:59,170
first-person case study of a morbid

1142
00:44:54,670 --> 00:45:01,930
crinch obsession so cat girl trans girls

1143
00:44:59,170 --> 00:45:04,240
are okay I can't believe I'm about to

1144
00:45:01,930 --> 00:45:06,880
explain this they're trans women usually

1145
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:11,640
attracted to women who express their

1146
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:15,160
identity online through cloying neoteny

1147
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:17,079
otaku memory and my conscious reason for

1148
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:20,200
cringing at them is that I see these

1149
00:45:17,079 --> 00:45:23,319
Japanese cartoon car girls as a kind of

1150
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:25,420
visual baby-talk and infantilized an

1151
00:45:23,319 --> 00:45:27,819
unrealistic representation of femininity

1152
00:45:25,420 --> 00:45:30,279
and womanhood that's designed to

1153
00:45:27,819 --> 00:45:34,690
titillate nerdy boys so in trans women

1154
00:45:30,279 --> 00:45:37,299
identify with it I cringe like no you

1155
00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:39,640
can't become an anime girl Lily [ __ ]

1156
00:45:37,299 --> 00:45:41,529
your dreams now look I don't want to get

1157
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:43,779
sidetracked with a discussion of whether

1158
00:45:41,529 --> 00:45:45,609
my opinions about cat girls are fair or

1159
00:45:43,779 --> 00:45:47,390
correct so don't listen to what I'm

1160
00:45:45,609 --> 00:45:50,060
saying about cat girl

1161
00:45:47,390 --> 00:45:52,730
listen to what I'm feeling about cat

1162
00:45:50,060 --> 00:45:54,770
girls listen to the contempt beneath my

1163
00:45:52,730 --> 00:45:56,050
words because even if everything I'm

1164
00:45:54,770 --> 00:45:59,960
saying is true

1165
00:45:56,050 --> 00:46:02,960
cat girls are being cringe online is a

1166
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:05,060
situation so inconsequential that any

1167
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:08,360
amount of emotional energy spent on it

1168
00:46:05,060 --> 00:46:11,300
is too much so why do I have this cringe

1169
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:13,430
fixation well according to the a log

1170
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:15,830
theory of morbid cringing we form

1171
00:46:13,430 --> 00:46:17,780
obsessive and addictive contempt for

1172
00:46:15,830 --> 00:46:20,510
people who have traits in common with us

1173
00:46:17,780 --> 00:46:22,340
people who make us uncomfortable because

1174
00:46:20,510 --> 00:46:25,550
we see something of ourselves and then

1175
00:46:22,340 --> 00:46:28,700
so do I have traits in common with the

1176
00:46:25,550 --> 00:46:31,160
Cowgirls well we're both trans women

1177
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:35,600
we're both attracted to women

1178
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:37,910
I do like anime but I don't like the

1179
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:40,030
anime they like okay I like good anime

1180
00:46:37,910 --> 00:46:42,140
that has you know mature

1181
00:46:40,030 --> 00:46:43,970
three-dimensional female characters look

1182
00:46:42,140 --> 00:46:46,010
I'm a real transgender okay I'm not like

1183
00:46:43,970 --> 00:46:47,780
you it's also not lost on me that this

1184
00:46:46,010 --> 00:46:51,320
is like the seventh time on this channel

1185
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:57,020
I've dressed as a cowgirl to make fun of

1186
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:58,490
them I have posted cringe you should all

1187
00:46:57,020 --> 00:47:01,250
be laughing at me right now

1188
00:46:58,490 --> 00:47:02,869
yawn yawn yawn yawn yawn yawn yeah so I

1189
00:47:01,250 --> 00:47:04,820
do think there's some truth to the idea

1190
00:47:02,869 --> 00:47:06,310
that I'm a logging these cat girls I

1191
00:47:04,820 --> 00:47:09,140
also think is a group representation

1192
00:47:06,310 --> 00:47:11,330
aspect to this like I am afraid that

1193
00:47:09,140 --> 00:47:13,790
other people will cringe at a group that

1194
00:47:11,330 --> 00:47:15,920
includes me trans lesbians because of

1195
00:47:13,790 --> 00:47:17,060
how these cat girls are acting so let's

1196
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:19,880
make another distinction between

1197
00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:21,350
in-group cringe and out group cringe and

1198
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:22,910
group cringe is when you cringe at

1199
00:47:21,350 --> 00:47:25,100
someone who belongs to the same group

1200
00:47:22,910 --> 00:47:27,410
identity as you for example your family

1201
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:29,840
your romantic partnership your ethnicity

1202
00:47:27,410 --> 00:47:31,400
or your country particularly if they're

1203
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:33,710
embarrassing themselves in front of

1204
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:36,260
outsiders to the group think about how

1205
00:47:33,710 --> 00:47:37,730
embarrassed a teenager gets if her mom

1206
00:47:36,260 --> 00:47:39,560
does something cringy in front of her

1207
00:47:37,730 --> 00:47:41,570
friends or think about how embarrassed

1208
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:44,000
liberal Americans get when we talk to

1209
00:47:41,570 --> 00:47:46,160
foreigners about Donald Trump being our

1210
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,869
president or think about these phrases

1211
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:49,880
she makes me embarrassed to be a

1212
00:47:47,869 --> 00:47:52,369
youtuber they're making trans people

1213
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:54,320
look bad he's giving autistics a bad

1214
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:56,750
name when we crunches someone who

1215
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:58,640
belongs to our identity group we don't

1216
00:47:56,750 --> 00:48:01,370
just feel vicarious and bear

1217
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:03,470
we feel embarrassment because they're

1218
00:48:01,370 --> 00:48:06,470
disgraceful behavior makes us look bad

1219
00:48:03,470 --> 00:48:08,480
too so in group cringe is actually a

1220
00:48:06,470 --> 00:48:10,490
kind of self cringe because you're

1221
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:12,680
cringing at your membership in an

1222
00:48:10,490 --> 00:48:14,150
embarrassing group nothing has ever

1223
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:16,430
triggered this kind of end group

1224
00:48:14,150 --> 00:48:18,680
embarrassment more from me than a cringe

1225
00:48:16,430 --> 00:48:21,020
video there went viral last year in

1226
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:23,300
which a masculine trans woman throws a

1227
00:48:21,020 --> 00:48:30,980
tantrum over being misgendered in a

1228
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:34,610
Gamestop excuse me it's ma'am it is

1229
00:48:30,980 --> 00:48:46,160
ma'am this video is excruciating for me

1230
00:48:34,610 --> 00:48:48,350
to watch the paradoxical absurdity of

1231
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:53,390
trying to brutishly intimidate people

1232
00:48:48,350 --> 00:48:54,770
and to seeing you as a woman mmm

1233
00:48:53,390 --> 00:48:56,240
Twitter's gonna come for me over this

1234
00:48:54,770 --> 00:48:58,940
and say Natalie hates trans lemonade

1235
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:59,720
don't pass but passing is really not

1236
00:48:58,940 --> 00:49:03,320
what this is about

1237
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:05,770
it's aggressive intimidating hyper

1238
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:09,350
masculine behavior from a trans woman

1239
00:49:05,770 --> 00:49:17,480
accompanied by apparently total delusion

1240
00:49:09,350 --> 00:49:19,100
about how she's presenting it's really

1241
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:20,750
not that clear Gorge and that's what

1242
00:49:19,100 --> 00:49:23,810
makes this video classic cringe right

1243
00:49:20,750 --> 00:49:26,990
the incongruity between her thinking

1244
00:49:23,810 --> 00:49:29,270
that she's serving woman while bellowing

1245
00:49:26,990 --> 00:49:30,950
like a drill sergeant by the way what

1246
00:49:29,270 --> 00:49:32,750
I'm doing right now this is cringe

1247
00:49:30,950 --> 00:49:34,850
reaction content I don't really do that

1248
00:49:32,750 --> 00:49:36,380
on this channel but I'm dipping my toe

1249
00:49:34,850 --> 00:49:39,260
in just as see how it feels

1250
00:49:36,380 --> 00:49:40,790
and it feels good like intoxicatingly

1251
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:42,890
good I can see how you could get

1252
00:49:40,790 --> 00:49:45,950
addicted to this I'm imagining myself

1253
00:49:42,890 --> 00:49:48,500
right now surrounded by six people and I

1254
00:49:45,950 --> 00:49:51,210
am leading the righteous mob as we point

1255
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:54,690
and laugh at some delusional

1256
00:49:51,210 --> 00:49:57,510
manly dumptruck I am a real transgender

1257
00:49:54,690 --> 00:49:59,970
a true transgender a good transgender

1258
00:49:57,510 --> 00:50:02,099
father find the approves of me this

1259
00:49:59,970 --> 00:50:03,810
would be the unconscious archetypal

1260
00:50:02,099 --> 00:50:05,700
father jot that down in my progress

1261
00:50:03,810 --> 00:50:08,010
notes please doctor okay so why does

1262
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:09,420
this feel so good well let me talk you

1263
00:50:08,010 --> 00:50:12,150
through my feelings when I watch that

1264
00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:14,250
gamestop video for the first few seconds

1265
00:50:12,150 --> 00:50:16,170
I do feel vicarious embarrassment for

1266
00:50:14,250 --> 00:50:17,580
her I can't even relate because in the

1267
00:50:16,170 --> 00:50:20,670
first couple months of my transition

1268
00:50:17,580 --> 00:50:22,589
there was an occasion where I was in a

1269
00:50:20,670 --> 00:50:24,390
lengthy customer service interaction

1270
00:50:22,589 --> 00:50:27,030
where the guy at the desk

1271
00:50:24,390 --> 00:50:28,740
was calling me sir the entire time and

1272
00:50:27,030 --> 00:50:31,170
there's something very humiliating about

1273
00:50:28,740 --> 00:50:33,570
trying to present female like wearing a

1274
00:50:31,170 --> 00:50:35,790
dress and makeup and yet being called

1275
00:50:33,570 --> 00:50:37,800
sir it's a quintessential mismatch

1276
00:50:35,790 --> 00:50:39,690
between self concept and the way other

1277
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:42,030
people are seeing you and the memory of

1278
00:50:39,690 --> 00:50:45,150
it is painful to me but what I cling to

1279
00:50:42,030 --> 00:50:48,690
is that while I may have looked like a

1280
00:50:45,150 --> 00:50:50,670
man at least I didn't act like a man I

1281
00:50:48,690 --> 00:50:54,089
didn't threaten to take anyone outside

1282
00:50:50,670 --> 00:50:56,339
and show them a sir in fact I was too

1283
00:50:54,089 --> 00:50:58,740
ashamed even to correct the guy so as

1284
00:50:56,339 --> 00:51:00,960
the GameStop video progresses my

1285
00:50:58,740 --> 00:51:02,099
sympathy runs out fast and instead of

1286
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:03,900
compassionate cringe

1287
00:51:02,099 --> 00:51:05,820
I feel group embarrassment for trans

1288
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:09,300
women including myself yet I feel

1289
00:51:05,820 --> 00:51:11,400
contempt toward this individual for

1290
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:14,339
making us all look bad I also feel a

1291
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:16,770
kind of morbid fascination rooted in

1292
00:51:14,339 --> 00:51:18,630
fear what if I masked illusional as that

1293
00:51:16,770 --> 00:51:20,490
trans woman I don't look and sounds like

1294
00:51:18,630 --> 00:51:22,920
that do i I feel like I have to do a

1295
00:51:20,490 --> 00:51:24,839
sanity check I start scrutinizing myself

1296
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:27,420
in the mirror listening to recordings of

1297
00:51:24,839 --> 00:51:29,369
my voice just to make sure and that fear

1298
00:51:27,420 --> 00:51:30,810
motivates me to distance myself from

1299
00:51:29,369 --> 00:51:33,330
that person in the video

1300
00:51:30,810 --> 00:51:35,220
I don't feel compassion for her cuz that

1301
00:51:33,330 --> 00:51:36,990
would mean putting myself in her size 16

1302
00:51:35,220 --> 00:51:39,240
shoes and I don't want to do that

1303
00:51:36,990 --> 00:51:41,160
because I'm horrified and repulsed by

1304
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:44,099
the thought that i'ma like her in some

1305
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:46,020
way so I want to push away and contempt

1306
00:51:44,099 --> 00:51:48,359
as a way of emotionally distancing

1307
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:50,760
myself and if I express that contempt by

1308
00:51:48,359 --> 00:51:52,910
publicly shaming and condemning her that

1309
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:56,160
I'm also socially distancing myself

1310
00:51:52,910 --> 00:51:58,640
accidental kovat jokes oops guess it's

1311
00:51:56,160 --> 00:52:00,170
uh contagious

1312
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:03,860
having many people who are stigmatized

1313
00:52:00,170 --> 00:52:06,980
or who have been humiliated long for the

1314
00:52:03,860 --> 00:52:09,140
experience of being unnormal surrounded

1315
00:52:06,980 --> 00:52:11,420
by fellow normals judging and

1316
00:52:09,140 --> 00:52:13,640
humiliating of freak and if you take a

1317
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:15,860
look around trans YouTube a lot of the

1318
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:18,950
biggest creators in the platform have

1319
00:52:15,860 --> 00:52:21,350
channels basically devoted to exactly

1320
00:52:18,950 --> 00:52:23,900
this type of cringe reaction humility

1321
00:52:21,350 --> 00:52:25,520
mantilla tuber Calvin Guerra is a trans

1322
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:27,380
guy who's best known for what are

1323
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:30,200
essentially cringe reaction videos

1324
00:52:27,380 --> 00:52:32,780
mostly aimed at people he deems trans

1325
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:35,420
trenders that is people who claim to be

1326
00:52:32,780 --> 00:52:38,270
trans but who aren't real transgenders

1327
00:52:35,420 --> 00:52:40,610
like Calvin he's especially bothered by

1328
00:52:38,270 --> 00:52:42,860
Gurley a fab trans and non-binary

1329
00:52:40,610 --> 00:52:45,680
teenagers or by anyone who blurs the

1330
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:47,300
line between lesbian and trans masculine

1331
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:49,280
identities sometimes he'll do a

1332
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:51,650
long-form reaction to a specific person

1333
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:56,260
who grinds his gears so this person is

1334
00:52:51,650 --> 00:53:00,290
an asexual non-binary transgender

1335
00:52:56,260 --> 00:53:03,380
lesbian who uses he's a it Dawn's

1336
00:53:00,290 --> 00:53:06,200
pronouns according to my calculations

1337
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:08,060
you are a transgender and other times

1338
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:15,890
he'll basically just laugh at cringy

1339
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:17,810
trans tik-tok teens he has a couple

1340
00:53:15,890 --> 00:53:19,550
justifications for making these videos

1341
00:53:17,810 --> 00:53:21,350
one is that he's actually helping the

1342
00:53:19,550 --> 00:53:23,210
people he's cringing at because of at

1343
00:53:21,350 --> 00:53:25,580
render transitions then they'll get

1344
00:53:23,210 --> 00:53:27,650
dysphoria and have to D transition but I

1345
00:53:25,580 --> 00:53:29,480
have to wonder does humiliating or

1346
00:53:27,650 --> 00:53:31,100
laughing at people really help them

1347
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:33,170
figure out whether they're trans or not

1348
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:35,270
his other justification is that trans

1349
00:53:33,170 --> 00:53:37,130
trenders are giving real trans people a

1350
00:53:35,270 --> 00:53:39,320
bad name they're the reason people are

1351
00:53:37,130 --> 00:53:42,890
transphobic this is why they hate us

1352
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:45,380
it's because of the trenders well I love

1353
00:53:42,890 --> 00:53:48,140
that idea of a true scum free isn't that

1354
00:53:45,380 --> 00:53:51,380
just as much as wonderful true

1355
00:53:48,140 --> 00:53:53,720
discomfort but it's not though I mean

1356
00:53:51,380 --> 00:53:55,370
transphobia existed long before there

1357
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:57,710
are people you could plausibly describe

1358
00:53:55,370 --> 00:53:59,720
as trans trenders so trans trenders

1359
00:53:57,710 --> 00:54:01,430
aren't the reason society hates trans

1360
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:03,230
people Calvin they're the reason you

1361
00:54:01,430 --> 00:54:04,850
hate trans people right or at least the

1362
00:54:03,230 --> 00:54:06,200
trans community and I feel like what

1363
00:54:04,850 --> 00:54:07,020
you're doing is you're projecting that

1364
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:09,330
feeling on justice

1365
00:54:07,020 --> 00:54:11,520
idea large and you're saying oh this is

1366
00:54:09,330 --> 00:54:13,200
the reason people are transphobic and to

1367
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:15,420
be fair I get that it's not just a

1368
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:18,300
projection like back in 2016

1369
00:54:15,420 --> 00:54:19,770
the SJW cringe era it was sis people

1370
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:23,070
mocking trans people with all these

1371
00:54:19,770 --> 00:54:25,170
tropes attack helicopter two genders 76

1372
00:54:23,070 --> 00:54:27,390
genders special snowflakes but now

1373
00:54:25,170 --> 00:54:29,460
they're used by trans people trying to

1374
00:54:27,390 --> 00:54:31,260
distance themselves trying to get Oh

1375
00:54:29,460 --> 00:54:32,760
eyes the most laughed at people in the

1376
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:34,680
community under the label of

1377
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:36,180
transgenders and Calvin there may be

1378
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:38,160
some truth to what you're saying about

1379
00:54:36,180 --> 00:54:39,810
their being confused teenagers who think

1380
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:41,490
they're trans when they're not I mean I

1381
00:54:39,810 --> 00:54:42,960
wouldn't know I'm a near dead woman in

1382
00:54:41,490 --> 00:54:44,490
the twilight of my life and I don't hang

1383
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:47,280
out with teenagers but even if it is

1384
00:54:44,490 --> 00:54:49,350
true Calvin your fixation on it seems

1385
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:52,020
disproportionate to me like you return

1386
00:54:49,350 --> 00:54:53,970
to this topic to cringe again and again

1387
00:54:52,020 --> 00:54:56,340
and again and again and again and again

1388
00:54:53,970 --> 00:54:57,870
it's like you're picking out a wound it

1389
00:54:56,340 --> 00:55:00,600
feels to me like a morbid cringe

1390
00:54:57,870 --> 00:55:02,430
obsession and I guess I think I

1391
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:04,500
recognize part of myself in you this

1392
00:55:02,430 --> 00:55:06,990
could be me projecting of course but I

1393
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:08,490
wonder if the way you feel about girly

1394
00:55:06,990 --> 00:55:11,580
Sparkle gender a fabs

1395
00:55:08,490 --> 00:55:13,050
is similar to the way I feel about otaku

1396
00:55:11,580 --> 00:55:15,420
trans bein catgirls

1397
00:55:13,050 --> 00:55:17,580
and it might be worth considering that I

1398
00:55:15,420 --> 00:55:19,110
don't cringe at the sparkle genders the

1399
00:55:17,580 --> 00:55:21,480
way you do I mean I'm with you on

1400
00:55:19,110 --> 00:55:24,120
wondering what a he's a Z er gender flux

1401
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:26,220
lesbian Demi boi is but unlike you

1402
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:28,050
Calvin I just don't have a morbid

1403
00:55:26,220 --> 00:55:29,880
current obsession with feminine a fab

1404
00:55:28,050 --> 00:55:31,530
trans people they can identify as

1405
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:33,810
however many genders they want for all I

1406
00:55:31,530 --> 00:55:36,210
care I may not always understand it but

1407
00:55:33,810 --> 00:55:37,860
I support their journey I guess it

1408
00:55:36,210 --> 00:55:39,630
doesn't bother me because I'm not

1409
00:55:37,860 --> 00:55:41,910
worried that anyone will judge me

1410
00:55:39,630 --> 00:55:44,070
because of how they bathe I don't feel

1411
00:55:41,910 --> 00:55:45,690
in Group cringe I was a different story

1412
00:55:44,070 --> 00:55:47,990
if I'm reading a general lesbian

1413
00:55:45,690 --> 00:55:51,090
subreddit and I see a comment like

1414
00:55:47,990 --> 00:55:54,180
pre-transition trans lesbian here I wish

1415
00:55:51,090 --> 00:55:56,010
I had titties girl dick Yaya get the

1416
00:55:54,180 --> 00:55:58,350
[ __ ] out of here Billy you're giving

1417
00:55:56,010 --> 00:56:01,230
real trans lesbians a bad name this is

1418
00:55:58,350 --> 00:56:04,140
why they hate us see now I have strong

1419
00:56:01,230 --> 00:56:06,630
feelings now I'm in group cringing and

1420
00:56:04,140 --> 00:56:09,210
intellectually I do think my feelings

1421
00:56:06,630 --> 00:56:11,880
are correct to some extent like I don't

1422
00:56:09,210 --> 00:56:14,220
think a general lesbian community is the

1423
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:16,510
appropriate forum for a trans woman

1424
00:56:14,220 --> 00:56:19,240
who's effectively still living as a

1425
00:56:16,510 --> 00:56:21,730
to take the mic and whine about wanting

1426
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:24,250
titties or rhapsodize about girl dick

1427
00:56:21,730 --> 00:56:26,890
but I'm also aware that I feel this

1428
00:56:24,250 --> 00:56:29,650
strongly about this because of my own

1429
00:56:26,890 --> 00:56:33,040
dysphoria and my own shame and honestly

1430
00:56:29,650 --> 00:56:35,020
my own self living like I can't even

1431
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:36,750
talk just as women on dating apps

1432
00:56:35,020 --> 00:56:39,460
because I feel like a fake woman

1433
00:56:36,750 --> 00:56:41,710
imposing myself on real women that's

1434
00:56:39,460 --> 00:56:44,500
where my head is on so where does this

1435
00:56:41,710 --> 00:56:46,750
free transition trans lesbian get the

1436
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:48,940
audacity you know it makes me feel in

1437
00:56:46,750 --> 00:56:51,670
group cringe about an identity trans

1438
00:56:48,940 --> 00:56:53,800
lesbianism which for me is already a

1439
00:56:51,670 --> 00:56:56,740
pain point of insecurity and

1440
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:59,020
embarrassment and shame so Calvin maybe

1441
00:56:56,740 --> 00:57:01,480
and they can I could just be projecting

1442
00:56:59,020 --> 00:57:03,520
but maybe that's kind of like how you

1443
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:05,260
feel about these trenders when you make

1444
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:07,450
these videos condemning them as not

1445
00:57:05,260 --> 00:57:10,060
really trans aren't you essentially

1446
00:57:07,450 --> 00:57:12,010
exiling them from the in-group so you no

1447
00:57:10,060 --> 00:57:15,910
longer feel the pain of in-group cringe

1448
00:57:12,010 --> 00:57:18,930
or perhaps calvin guerra which you're

1449
00:57:15,910 --> 00:57:21,410
really trying to destroy is the Trender

1450
00:57:18,930 --> 00:57:23,570
within

1451
00:57:21,410 --> 00:57:25,370
and again I could be full of [ __ ] here

1452
00:57:23,570 --> 00:57:27,620
at the end of the day this is

1453
00:57:25,370 --> 00:57:29,750
psychoanalysis of a youtuber I haven't

1454
00:57:27,620 --> 00:57:32,450
met so feel free to tell me if I'm full

1455
00:57:29,750 --> 00:57:35,540
of [ __ ] Calvin but still I guess I

1456
00:57:32,450 --> 00:57:38,240
invite you to consider whether producing

1457
00:57:35,540 --> 00:57:40,400
transgender humility mint is actually

1458
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:43,400
helping anything or whether it's really

1459
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:44,960
just an addictive way to scratch some

1460
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:47,090
kind of emotional itch

1461
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:53,120
alright I've said my piece about Calvin

1462
00:57:47,090 --> 00:57:55,010
who's about Vanessa we meet again Gorge

1463
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:57,590
and once again I wearing some kind of

1464
00:57:55,010 --> 00:58:00,500
embarrassing anime hairpiece vanessa is

1465
00:57:57,590 --> 00:58:02,810
a trans woman who is the second most

1466
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:04,490
popular political transit to birth at

1467
00:58:02,810 --> 00:58:06,290
least that's what I wrote in the script

1468
00:58:04,490 --> 00:58:08,120
when I had more subscribers than her and

1469
00:58:06,290 --> 00:58:11,630
was fully prepared to be a cut about it

1470
00:58:08,120 --> 00:58:13,910
but since then she has in fact surpassed

1471
00:58:11,630 --> 00:58:15,500
me once again good for her vanessa

1472
00:58:13,910 --> 00:58:18,020
started out as basically a cringe

1473
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:19,880
reaction channel back when sjw cringe

1474
00:58:18,020 --> 00:58:22,370
was fashionable she crash at a wide

1475
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:24,260
variety of sjw's but the most consistent

1476
00:58:22,370 --> 00:58:26,450
theme was trans trenders and crazy

1477
00:58:24,260 --> 00:58:28,760
activists are giving real trans people a

1478
00:58:26,450 --> 00:58:31,160
bad name they're making us look bad this

1479
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:33,410
is why people hate us so we can now

1480
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:35,960
recognize because a standard in-group

1481
00:58:33,410 --> 00:58:39,920
cringe fixation but Vanessa focused in

1482
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:42,410
particular on his strident SJW type

1483
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:45,290
trans woman called Wylie Dennis and

1484
00:58:42,410 --> 00:58:46,970
Vanessa made several reaction videos to

1485
00:58:45,290 --> 00:58:49,550
her where she made a point of

1486
00:58:46,970 --> 00:58:52,610
misgendering royally and dismissing her

1487
00:58:49,550 --> 00:58:55,040
as a fake transgender who hadn't

1488
00:58:52,610 --> 00:58:57,920
transitioned and clearly had no

1489
00:58:55,040 --> 00:59:00,140
intention to you know if you went on

1490
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:01,550
estrogen your sex drive wouldn't be so

1491
00:59:00,140 --> 00:59:03,220
high and you wouldn't be guilt tripping

1492
00:59:01,550 --> 00:59:06,400
people into having sex with you just

1493
00:59:03,220 --> 00:59:08,540
saying but then why they made a video

1494
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:10,850
revealing that she'd been hormone

1495
00:59:08,540 --> 00:59:13,610
therapy for a year and was about to

1496
00:59:10,850 --> 00:59:15,650
undergo facial feminization surgery this

1497
00:59:13,610 --> 00:59:18,320
prompted Vanessa to make an apology

1498
00:59:15,650 --> 00:59:20,210
video where she not only apologized sir

1499
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:22,340
Miley and acknowledged her transition

1500
00:59:20,210 --> 00:59:24,590
but she actually went beyond the script

1501
00:59:22,340 --> 00:59:26,570
of a generic oopsie-doopsie YouTube

1502
00:59:24,590 --> 00:59:29,000
video and to opened up about having

1503
00:59:26,570 --> 00:59:31,220
experienced herself the cruelty she

1504
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:33,950
directed at Riley and I'm someone who

1505
00:59:31,220 --> 00:59:36,260
has had my transition picked apart on

1506
00:59:33,950 --> 00:59:38,300
line there have been reddit threads and

1507
00:59:36,260 --> 00:59:40,070
4chan guys with hundreds of comments on

1508
00:59:38,300 --> 00:59:41,630
it of people trying to prove that I'm

1509
00:59:40,070 --> 00:59:44,420
not chance because I haven't done this

1510
00:59:41,630 --> 00:59:46,310
or that or you know digging up my old

1511
00:59:44,420 --> 00:59:48,950
pictures and so the thought that this

1512
00:59:46,310 --> 00:59:52,340
entire time I've done that exact same

1513
00:59:48,950 --> 00:59:55,400
thing to someone else and pushed that

1514
00:59:52,340 --> 00:59:57,950
off on someone else [ __ ] with me and

1515
00:59:55,400 --> 01:00:01,400
I'm [ __ ] sorry Vanessa I actually

1516
00:59:57,950 --> 01:00:04,010
managed for one fleeting moment to make

1517
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:06,440
a connection between her own pass her

1518
01:00:04,010 --> 01:00:08,180
and trauma and the pain she did selected

1519
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:10,880
on another person which is kind of a

1520
01:00:08,180 --> 01:00:13,010
once-in-a-lifetime event on a website

1521
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:14,810
where the performers are remorseless

1522
01:00:13,010 --> 01:00:17,240
Psychopaths who wouldn't muddy their

1523
01:00:14,810 --> 01:00:19,430
shoes to save a drowning child and the

1524
01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:21,670
viewers are cold-blooded sadists who

1525
01:00:19,430 --> 01:00:24,040
consume human misery like a glutton

1526
01:00:21,670 --> 01:00:26,540
gorging himself at a particularly

1527
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:28,220
sumptuous buffet you know this whole

1528
01:00:26,540 --> 01:00:31,790
thing has really taught me a lesson that

1529
01:00:28,220 --> 01:00:32,720
I should really try to stick to ideas

1530
01:00:31,790 --> 01:00:36,680
opinions

1531
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:37,430
policy however this lesson would not

1532
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:40,430
last

1533
01:00:37,430 --> 01:00:42,560
Vanessa kept doing SJW cringe content

1534
01:00:40,430 --> 01:00:45,770
well past the point that had become

1535
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:49,670
passé making a video with big red in the

1536
01:00:45,770 --> 01:00:51,860
thumbnail as recently as 2019 I admit I

1537
01:00:49,670 --> 01:00:55,160
thought she was fading into irrelevance

1538
01:00:51,860 --> 01:00:58,370
but once again I underestimated Vanessa

1539
01:00:55,160 --> 01:01:00,950
in july 2019 her channel rocketed to a

1540
01:00:58,370 --> 01:01:03,890
new level of success when she released a

1541
01:01:00,950 --> 01:01:07,730
video titled exposing jessica Yaniv

1542
01:01:03,890 --> 01:01:09,950
trans predator in this video Vanessa

1543
01:01:07,730 --> 01:01:12,800
sounds the alarm about a trans woman or

1544
01:01:09,950 --> 01:01:15,050
rather she believes a man posing as a

1545
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:19,010
trans woman called Jessica

1546
01:01:15,050 --> 01:01:22,490
yaaayyy who the [ __ ] is Jessica Yaniv

1547
01:01:19,010 --> 01:01:26,240
well as far as I can tell everything

1548
01:01:22,490 --> 01:01:28,520
Vanessa says about you Nev is true yaniv

1549
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:31,010
attempted to use a Canadian Human Rights

1550
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:32,810
Tribunal to close down several beauty

1551
01:01:31,010 --> 01:01:33,710
salons that had refused to walk her

1552
01:01:32,810 --> 01:01:35,810
hairy balls

1553
01:01:33,710 --> 01:01:37,910
after she approached them about it in an

1554
01:01:35,810 --> 01:01:39,770
awkward and creepy way she has a long

1555
01:01:37,910 --> 01:01:42,680
history of sending extremely

1556
01:01:39,770 --> 01:01:45,710
inappropriate messages to underage girls

1557
01:01:42,680 --> 01:01:46,580
and she attempted to host a topless pool

1558
01:01:45,710 --> 01:01:49,190
party

1559
01:01:46,580 --> 01:01:51,650
for unchaperoned children basically

1560
01:01:49,190 --> 01:01:53,840
Yaniv is someone who appropriates the

1561
01:01:51,650 --> 01:01:56,930
language of transgender acceptance and

1562
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:59,510
equality to cloak predatory behavior

1563
01:01:56,930 --> 01:02:01,520
toward minors admire ii don Yaniv by the

1564
01:01:59,510 --> 01:02:04,160
way is not that she's a cunning

1565
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:07,330
manipulator but that this is someone who

1566
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:09,830
is mentally not playing with a full deck

1567
01:02:07,330 --> 01:02:11,900
after the success of her initial video

1568
01:02:09,830 --> 01:02:14,780
Vanessa made a few more videos about

1569
01:02:11,900 --> 01:02:18,070
Yaniv rebranding herself as a kind of

1570
01:02:14,780 --> 01:02:21,200
transsexual Chris Hansen exposing

1571
01:02:18,070 --> 01:02:24,770
transgender predators wherever she could

1572
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:27,440
find them and at first I was honestly

1573
01:02:24,770 --> 01:02:29,060
kind of loving this for Vanessa at least

1574
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:31,040
now she's finally picking on someone who

1575
01:02:29,060 --> 01:02:34,820
deserves it but the more I think about

1576
01:02:31,040 --> 01:02:37,400
it the more hesitations I have one is

1577
01:02:34,820 --> 01:02:39,380
that Vanessa framed the Yaniv story and

1578
01:02:37,400 --> 01:02:41,630
the lack of attention given to it by

1579
01:02:39,380 --> 01:02:44,690
other trans public figures as an

1580
01:02:41,630 --> 01:02:46,340
indictment of trans activists who

1581
01:02:44,690 --> 01:02:50,330
Vanessa thinks should spend more time

1582
01:02:46,340 --> 01:02:54,110
sounding the alarm about transgender

1583
01:02:50,330 --> 01:02:56,330
proudly and I'm willing to admit there's

1584
01:02:54,110 --> 01:02:58,580
probably a valid point in there

1585
01:02:56,330 --> 01:03:00,410
somewhere like some trans people really

1586
01:02:58,580 --> 01:03:02,390
are so paranoid about transphobes

1587
01:03:00,410 --> 01:03:04,880
framing all of us as dangerous perverts

1588
01:03:02,390 --> 01:03:07,490
that they basically look the other way

1589
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:09,920
and refuse to acknowledge the small but

1590
01:03:07,490 --> 01:03:13,550
real subset of trans people who are in

1591
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:16,100
fact dangerous perverts but Blair you

1592
01:03:13,550 --> 01:03:18,800
talk about the Yaniv situation like it's

1593
01:03:16,100 --> 01:03:21,020
urgent breaking news like Yaniv should

1594
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:23,600
rightfully be a household name but for

1595
01:03:21,020 --> 01:03:26,720
the stubborn silence of trans activists

1596
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:28,940
but why why should everyone be focused

1597
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:30,680
on Jessica yaniv there's more than a

1598
01:03:28,940 --> 01:03:32,090
hundred thousand sexual assaults

1599
01:03:30,680 --> 01:03:34,730
reported to American law enforcement

1600
01:03:32,090 --> 01:03:36,920
every year the literal president of

1601
01:03:34,730 --> 01:03:40,010
America is a bit of a sexual predator

1602
01:03:36,920 --> 01:03:42,680
himself why fixate on this one

1603
01:03:40,010 --> 01:03:44,960
particular Canadian creep I guess you

1604
01:03:42,680 --> 01:03:48,470
could argue that since Yaniv is a trans

1605
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:51,260
identified predator a tip we as real

1606
01:03:48,470 --> 01:03:52,970
trans people have a responsibility to be

1607
01:03:51,260 --> 01:03:55,400
the ones who lead the charge to stop her

1608
01:03:52,970 --> 01:03:57,620
or at least it would be good optics for

1609
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:58,660
us to do that and again I think there's

1610
01:03:57,620 --> 01:04:01,990
maybe some true

1611
01:03:58,660 --> 01:04:04,599
to that like initially the LGBT website

1612
01:04:01,990 --> 01:04:06,940
pink news straightforwardly reported in

1613
01:04:04,599 --> 01:04:09,759
Eve's claims of discrimination which is

1614
01:04:06,940 --> 01:04:11,849
pretty embarrassing and not great optics

1615
01:04:09,759 --> 01:04:13,960
but I don't think that constantly

1616
01:04:11,849 --> 01:04:16,779
broadcasting updates about the

1617
01:04:13,960 --> 01:04:18,339
transgender what is really the best

1618
01:04:16,779 --> 01:04:20,170
optics for us either

1619
01:04:18,339 --> 01:04:22,690
why did you Anessa make this video in

1620
01:04:20,170 --> 01:04:25,210
the first place is it simply because she

1621
01:04:22,690 --> 01:04:27,809
cares deeply about the well-being of

1622
01:04:25,210 --> 01:04:31,089
children and she thought making a video

1623
01:04:27,809 --> 01:04:34,180
exposing Jessica Yaniv is the best way

1624
01:04:31,089 --> 01:04:35,859
to protect them I mean yeah I'm sure she

1625
01:04:34,180 --> 01:04:39,220
cares a little bit about the children

1626
01:04:35,859 --> 01:04:41,950
but it's still a YouTube video and you

1627
01:04:39,220 --> 01:04:46,269
have to ask is the primary intention

1628
01:04:41,950 --> 01:04:48,670
here really to stop a predator or is it

1629
01:04:46,269 --> 01:04:51,309
to manufacture a sleazy entertainment

1630
01:04:48,670 --> 01:04:52,750
spectacle shortly after her first Geneva

1631
01:04:51,309 --> 01:04:54,910
video was published

1632
01:04:52,750 --> 01:04:57,460
Vanessa hosted a live stream on her

1633
01:04:54,910 --> 01:05:01,359
channel titled heated debate with

1634
01:04:57,460 --> 01:05:04,660
Jessica Yaniv trans predator this got 2

1635
01:05:01,359 --> 01:05:06,430
million views is this what you do with

1636
01:05:04,660 --> 01:05:09,599
someone you've just accused of

1637
01:05:06,430 --> 01:05:12,789
pedophilia you host a live event

1638
01:05:09,599 --> 01:05:15,519
debating the pedophile on your YouTube

1639
01:05:12,789 --> 01:05:17,380
channel what's to debate I don't need to

1640
01:05:15,519 --> 01:05:20,769
be scared of my own house that I'm gonna

1641
01:05:17,380 --> 01:05:23,950
get [ __ ] to talk to the legal in

1642
01:05:20,769 --> 01:05:28,779
Canada just that but I think that was

1643
01:05:23,950 --> 01:05:30,970
like you will that a moment for you then

1644
01:05:28,779 --> 01:05:33,700
of course you sell t-shirts featuring

1645
01:05:30,970 --> 01:05:36,369
the meme that resulted from your YouTube

1646
01:05:33,700 --> 01:05:38,470
pedophile debate I mean that makes sense

1647
01:05:36,369 --> 01:05:41,859
if you're gonna catch a predator you

1648
01:05:38,470 --> 01:05:43,960
gotta sell pedophile debate merch and of

1649
01:05:41,859 --> 01:05:48,190
course you gotta follow the pedophiles

1650
01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:50,710
makeup tutorial you know for the

1651
01:05:48,190 --> 01:05:54,309
children now I hate to be overly

1652
01:05:50,710 --> 01:05:57,220
critical but when I look at this I don't

1653
01:05:54,309 --> 01:05:59,319
see a high-minded activist working to

1654
01:05:57,220 --> 01:06:03,369
protect children and trans people's

1655
01:05:59,319 --> 01:06:06,460
image I see a tabloid entertainer who's

1656
01:06:03,369 --> 01:06:09,490
discovered a way to monetize milking

1657
01:06:06,460 --> 01:06:11,589
lols from a mentally defective pervert

1658
01:06:09,490 --> 01:06:14,039
and I have to say Blair as

1659
01:06:11,589 --> 01:06:15,940
connoisseur of trash myself I'm very

1660
01:06:14,039 --> 01:06:18,789
entertained by all of this

1661
01:06:15,940 --> 01:06:22,569
following a sexual predators makeup

1662
01:06:18,789 --> 01:06:25,299
tutorial that's genius I wish I'd

1663
01:06:22,569 --> 01:06:28,299
thought of that but just be honest this

1664
01:06:25,299 --> 01:06:31,420
isn't activism this isn't justice

1665
01:06:28,299 --> 01:06:34,119
it's a low-cal cult it's like one of

1666
01:06:31,420 --> 01:06:37,269
maari's transsexuals took over the show

1667
01:06:34,119 --> 01:06:40,660
and I love that for her I love that for

1668
01:06:37,269 --> 01:06:43,390
her but Blair I can't help but notice

1669
01:06:40,660 --> 01:06:46,269
you're still hitting all the same beats

1670
01:06:43,390 --> 01:06:49,930
your videos have always hit attention

1671
01:06:46,269 --> 01:06:53,289
everyone there is a bad transgender in

1672
01:06:49,930 --> 01:06:55,799
our midst the bad transgender is not a

1673
01:06:53,289 --> 01:06:59,049
real transgender like me it's very

1674
01:06:55,799 --> 01:07:02,319
important that we all gather around to

1675
01:06:59,049 --> 01:07:04,630
condemn this bad transgender who is not

1676
01:07:02,319 --> 01:07:06,670
a real transgender and Blair will give

1677
01:07:04,630 --> 01:07:08,829
you this you are getting better at

1678
01:07:06,670 --> 01:07:10,900
choosing your targets the transvestite

1679
01:07:08,829 --> 01:07:13,599
monster is a stock character in our

1680
01:07:10,900 --> 01:07:16,150
culture and Jessica Yaniv is good

1681
01:07:13,599 --> 01:07:17,049
casting for the part she's a trans folks

1682
01:07:16,150 --> 01:07:18,940
boogeyman

1683
01:07:17,049 --> 01:07:20,859
come to life and I certainly am NOT

1684
01:07:18,940 --> 01:07:22,569
shedding any tears for her but you'll

1685
01:07:20,859 --> 01:07:24,819
have to excuse me if I don't take this

1686
01:07:22,569 --> 01:07:27,489
seriously as anything more than a

1687
01:07:24,819 --> 01:07:29,469
smarter version of the same in-group

1688
01:07:27,489 --> 01:07:32,559
cringe humility meant you've always made

1689
01:07:29,469 --> 01:07:35,739
and by the way you may want to check in

1690
01:07:32,559 --> 01:07:37,630
on your understudy Rose of dawn Rosa

1691
01:07:35,739 --> 01:07:39,880
Fatone is another conservative trans

1692
01:07:37,630 --> 01:07:42,609
woman youtuber who produces a series

1693
01:07:39,880 --> 01:07:45,219
called trans stupid hi everyone and

1694
01:07:42,609 --> 01:07:46,599
welcome to another edition of trans fat

1695
01:07:45,219 --> 01:07:49,989
the show where I take a look at the

1696
01:07:46,599 --> 01:07:51,819
wonderful world of lgbtqia+ plus plus

1697
01:07:49,989 --> 01:07:55,410
knees because stupidity is

1698
01:07:51,819 --> 01:08:02,880
intersectional transgender more like

1699
01:07:55,410 --> 01:08:05,079
trans [ __ ] more like trans gay trans

1700
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:07,479
I'm literally tightest realize I'm

1701
01:08:05,079 --> 01:08:09,999
literally trans gay roses channel is

1702
01:08:07,479 --> 01:08:13,239
allegedly about the excesses of trans

1703
01:08:09,999 --> 01:08:15,249
ideology and activism which in theory I

1704
01:08:13,239 --> 01:08:17,349
do think is a perspective worth

1705
01:08:15,249 --> 01:08:20,920
including in the conversation but in

1706
01:08:17,349 --> 01:08:23,259
practice well let's just say Rose has

1707
01:08:20,920 --> 01:08:24,570
produced a 30 minute documentary about

1708
01:08:23,259 --> 01:08:27,050
why Christian

1709
01:08:24,570 --> 01:08:29,900
is not a real transgender there is a bad

1710
01:08:27,050 --> 01:08:32,970
transgender in our midst the bad

1711
01:08:29,900 --> 01:08:35,070
transgender is not a real transgender

1712
01:08:32,970 --> 01:08:37,230
like me I'm getting pretty tired of this

1713
01:08:35,070 --> 01:08:38,730
and here's her transition advice to

1714
01:08:37,230 --> 01:08:40,680
trans women just beginning their journey

1715
01:08:38,730 --> 01:08:42,300
you probably have this image in your

1716
01:08:40,680 --> 01:08:45,030
head that you know you're going to be

1717
01:08:42,300 --> 01:08:46,500
this really cute looking trans men that

1718
01:08:45,030 --> 01:08:48,990
you like effectively you're going to be

1719
01:08:46,500 --> 01:08:52,950
this seal like look at this it isn't a

1720
01:08:48,990 --> 01:08:55,110
seal adorable you're so cute but but the

1721
01:08:52,950 --> 01:08:57,000
truth is you're probably not looking

1722
01:08:55,110 --> 01:08:58,920
like this seal right now are you know

1723
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:01,920
you're probably more like this big bull

1724
01:08:58,920 --> 01:09:05,220
seal barging your way into women's

1725
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:09,660
bathroom saying this is a woman's body

1726
01:09:05,220 --> 01:09:12,090
now you might never reach the cute seal

1727
01:09:09,660 --> 01:09:15,450
phase in fact very few of us to how it's

1728
01:09:12,090 --> 01:09:18,060
a lot like Blair White Rose no do not

1729
01:09:15,450 --> 01:09:21,090
simpler Vanessa it only encourages her

1730
01:09:18,060 --> 01:09:23,880
she's also made no less than 20 videos

1731
01:09:21,090 --> 01:09:25,230
about Jessica Yaniv which seems like

1732
01:09:23,880 --> 01:09:27,060
kind of a lot Gorge

1733
01:09:25,230 --> 01:09:28,920
would I be wrong to say I'm getting a

1734
01:09:27,060 --> 01:09:31,200
little bit of a morbid cringe addiction

1735
01:09:28,920 --> 01:09:32,790
vibe in these videos Rose Chronicles

1736
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:35,640
young Eve's numerous crimes and

1737
01:09:32,790 --> 01:09:39,300
wrongdoings but she also cannot resist

1738
01:09:35,640 --> 01:09:42,300
making it very clear how disgusted she

1739
01:09:39,300 --> 01:09:43,980
is with young Eve's appearance the irony

1740
01:09:42,300 --> 01:09:46,140
being that this kind of tweets came from

1741
01:09:43,980 --> 01:09:48,180
someone who you can smell just by

1742
01:09:46,140 --> 01:09:50,850
looking at a picture of them I bring

1743
01:09:48,180 --> 01:09:53,190
this up again not because I have any

1744
01:09:50,850 --> 01:09:55,740
interest at all in white knighting for

1745
01:09:53,190 --> 01:09:57,840
you Nev I do not support her journey as

1746
01:09:55,740 --> 01:10:00,180
far as I'm concerned she can eat [ __ ]

1747
01:09:57,840 --> 01:10:02,550
and maybe she does I wouldn't be

1748
01:10:00,180 --> 01:10:04,950
surprised no my point is that part of

1749
01:10:02,550 --> 01:10:07,260
the catharsis that rose and Vanessa

1750
01:10:04,950 --> 01:10:10,140
seemed to derive from making this kind

1751
01:10:07,260 --> 01:10:13,320
of content comes from contrasting

1752
01:10:10,140 --> 01:10:16,290
themselves as good presentable real

1753
01:10:13,320 --> 01:10:20,220
trans people with the hideousness of the

1754
01:10:16,290 --> 01:10:23,670
wretched fake trans dump truck a classic

1755
01:10:20,220 --> 01:10:28,820
Vanessa thumbnail is divided into two

1756
01:10:23,670 --> 01:10:36,199
halves on one half vanessa cooking fish

1757
01:10:28,820 --> 01:10:38,659
[ __ ] always with her lip gloss in the

1758
01:10:36,199 --> 01:10:42,260
livestream and in the other half of the

1759
01:10:38,659 --> 01:10:44,900
thumbnail for contrast the tragic dump

1760
01:10:42,260 --> 01:10:46,699
truck in a maladjusted wig and I'm

1761
01:10:44,900 --> 01:10:48,980
allowed to say dump truck because before

1762
01:10:46,699 --> 01:10:52,219
I transitioned I was one of Vanessa's

1763
01:10:48,980 --> 01:10:55,579
dump trucks I was one of hashtag her

1764
01:10:52,219 --> 01:10:57,949
dock truck look I happen to possess a

1765
01:10:55,579 --> 01:11:00,139
little thing you probably haven't heard

1766
01:10:57,949 --> 01:11:05,960
of it called inner beauty that's right

1767
01:11:00,139 --> 01:11:08,389
sweetie my pancreas unlockable meanwhile

1768
01:11:05,960 --> 01:11:12,320
Rose who refers to represent herself

1769
01:11:08,389 --> 01:11:15,079
with this cartoon okay

1770
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:18,050
straight up refers to an divas the tubby

1771
01:11:15,079 --> 01:11:20,329
Troon and the Titanic trainer of Canada

1772
01:11:18,050 --> 01:11:22,070
a particular Titanic Runner of Canada

1773
01:11:20,329 --> 01:11:24,619
that's light sonic trauma of Canada

1774
01:11:22,070 --> 01:11:27,739
trainer and trone being pejoratives for

1775
01:11:24,619 --> 01:11:30,409
transgender that I associate with 4chan

1776
01:11:27,739 --> 01:11:32,079
or I'm guessing Rose has spent a lot of

1777
01:11:30,409 --> 01:11:35,150
time

1778
01:11:32,079 --> 01:11:37,880
as for the emphatic revulsion toward

1779
01:11:35,150 --> 01:11:39,710
your Neves fatness well I'm guessing

1780
01:11:37,880 --> 01:11:42,139
that must be another important part of

1781
01:11:39,710 --> 01:11:45,380
stopping a predator right it seems

1782
01:11:42,139 --> 01:11:47,840
almost taboo to condemn people for how

1783
01:11:45,380 --> 01:11:50,840
rough they look when I think that that

1784
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:52,849
tough love in a way is needed because I

1785
01:11:50,840 --> 01:11:54,040
look at what I looked like when I first

1786
01:11:52,849 --> 01:11:56,290
translations

1787
01:11:54,040 --> 01:12:00,400
Jesus Christ I wish my friends had said

1788
01:11:56,290 --> 01:12:03,490
something like I looked bad like I was

1789
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:06,190
overweight I had poor taste in clothes

1790
01:12:03,490 --> 01:12:08,110
like I was never wearing stupid dresses

1791
01:12:06,190 --> 01:12:10,740
the ranking was mostly t-shirt for jeans

1792
01:12:08,110 --> 01:12:13,690
he probably more like it'd be worse you

1793
01:12:10,740 --> 01:12:19,050
barging the way to women's bathroom

1794
01:12:13,690 --> 01:12:19,050
saying this is a woman's body now

1795
01:12:25,310 --> 01:12:28,549
[Music]

1796
01:12:28,760 --> 01:12:35,900
Rose are you okay no you're not okay

1797
01:12:33,680 --> 01:12:38,570
none of us are okay no trans woman

1798
01:12:35,900 --> 01:12:41,030
remotely in the public eye is in any way

1799
01:12:38,570 --> 01:12:43,160
okay and look I don't want to take the

1800
01:12:41,030 --> 01:12:45,290
psychoanalysis too far because I don't

1801
01:12:43,160 --> 01:12:47,360
know from watching YouTube videos what's

1802
01:12:45,290 --> 01:12:49,670
going on in someone's head but I can try

1803
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:52,040
to make intelligent inferences and I

1804
01:12:49,670 --> 01:12:54,530
think it's pretty revealing that this is

1805
01:12:52,040 --> 01:12:56,510
how Rose introduces the topic of just

1806
01:12:54,530 --> 01:12:59,510
like I you Nev think well one of the

1807
01:12:56,510 --> 01:13:01,730
biggest characters in the whole [ __ ]

1808
01:12:59,510 --> 01:13:08,390
world at the moment which is Jessica you

1809
01:13:01,730 --> 01:13:15,080
Neve Rose Gorge yesica and Eve is not

1810
01:13:08,390 --> 01:13:17,180
one of any moment this is not a world

1811
01:13:15,080 --> 01:13:19,940
historical figure at the end of the day

1812
01:13:17,180 --> 01:13:21,650
this is a more or less random civilian

1813
01:13:19,940 --> 01:13:24,170
sex fiend off the streets of Vancouver

1814
01:13:21,650 --> 01:13:26,300
BC the only reason anyone has heard of

1815
01:13:24,170 --> 01:13:28,310
her at all is that Vanessa decided to go

1816
01:13:26,300 --> 01:13:30,620
fool to catch a predator and turn this

1817
01:13:28,310 --> 01:13:32,570
grimy reprobate into a minor anti

1818
01:13:30,620 --> 01:13:34,700
celebrity she is not one of the most

1819
01:13:32,570 --> 01:13:37,100
important characters in the world but it

1820
01:13:34,700 --> 01:13:39,080
sounds like what she is Rose is one of

1821
01:13:37,100 --> 01:13:41,690
the most important characters in your

1822
01:13:39,080 --> 01:13:44,300
brain this is distorted thinking it's

1823
01:13:41,690 --> 01:13:45,920
like a log comparing Christian to Hitler

1824
01:13:44,300 --> 01:13:47,410
you're so deep in the morbid crunch

1825
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:49,940
obsession that you've lost perspective

1826
01:13:47,410 --> 01:13:52,040
and I'm sure you have what seemed to you

1827
01:13:49,940 --> 01:13:53,450
like perfectly logical reasons while

1828
01:13:52,040 --> 01:13:55,640
you're devoting so much attention to

1829
01:13:53,450 --> 01:13:57,590
this and I know videos about Yaniv get a

1830
01:13:55,640 --> 01:14:00,680
lot of views so I'm sure that's a factor

1831
01:13:57,590 --> 01:14:02,060
too but Rose I also know a morbid cringe

1832
01:14:00,680 --> 01:14:04,220
obsession when I see one

1833
01:14:02,060 --> 01:14:06,140
and I know that being a visible trans

1834
01:14:04,220 --> 01:14:08,300
woman on the Internet is more difficult

1835
01:14:06,140 --> 01:14:10,760
than most people can imagine and I know

1836
01:14:08,300 --> 01:14:13,130
that pretty much every trans person is

1837
01:14:10,760 --> 01:14:15,500
bullied or ashamed or humiliated at some

1838
01:14:13,130 --> 01:14:17,750
point in our lives and I know how good

1839
01:14:15,500 --> 01:14:19,760
it can feel to take all the horrible

1840
01:14:17,750 --> 01:14:22,220
things transphobes and bullies and

1841
01:14:19,760 --> 01:14:26,230
turf's have said about us and repeat

1842
01:14:22,220 --> 01:14:29,300
them verbatim about some big fat fake

1843
01:14:26,230 --> 01:14:32,239
dangerous delusional disgusting male

1844
01:14:29,300 --> 01:14:34,610
fetishists oh it feels good to be the

1845
01:14:32,239 --> 01:14:37,040
turf for once it feels good to be the

1846
01:14:34,610 --> 01:14:38,680
judge rather than the judge because when

1847
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:41,560
you point the finger at someone else

1848
01:14:38,680 --> 01:14:43,450
you're also pointing away from yourself

1849
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:45,520
and it's not lost on me

1850
01:14:43,450 --> 01:14:47,380
that in conservative circles queer

1851
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:49,660
people are often treated like suspected

1852
01:14:47,380 --> 01:14:51,820
sex criminals by default so there's

1853
01:14:49,660 --> 01:14:52,990
safety and being the one who spearheads

1854
01:14:51,820 --> 01:14:55,510
that think of the children

1855
01:14:52,990 --> 01:14:58,630
type moral crusade and when you expose a

1856
01:14:55,510 --> 01:15:01,930
trans predator you get that feeling of

1857
01:14:58,630 --> 01:15:04,630
safety plus the relief of having someone

1858
01:15:01,930 --> 01:15:08,230
in particular to blame for the shame and

1859
01:15:04,630 --> 01:15:10,240
stigma we all feel jessica Yaniv is the

1860
01:15:08,230 --> 01:15:12,550
reason people hate us but that's just

1861
01:15:10,240 --> 01:15:13,930
not true it's a simple answer to a

1862
01:15:12,550 --> 01:15:16,210
complicated problem

1863
01:15:13,930 --> 01:15:19,390
it's scapegoating when I look at the

1864
01:15:16,210 --> 01:15:22,330
Univ of session on trans YouTube I see a

1865
01:15:19,390 --> 01:15:25,120
community trying to cope with stigma and

1866
01:15:22,330 --> 01:15:27,730
hoping that destroying a scapegoat will

1867
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:30,940
bring relief it's basically a blood

1868
01:15:27,730 --> 01:15:33,550
sacrifice it's not rational it feels

1869
01:15:30,940 --> 01:15:36,160
good for a moment but it's an addiction

1870
01:15:33,550 --> 01:15:38,740
it won't ever erase the stigma and the

1871
01:15:36,160 --> 01:15:42,630
shame and genève is simply the latest

1872
01:15:38,740 --> 01:15:44,350
and most deserving in a long line of bad

1873
01:15:42,630 --> 01:15:46,390
transgenders who aren't real

1874
01:15:44,350 --> 01:15:48,250
transgenders and are giving us a bad

1875
01:15:46,390 --> 01:15:50,890
name and are the reason people hate us

1876
01:15:48,250 --> 01:15:53,050
and must be condemned and destroyed but

1877
01:15:50,890 --> 01:15:54,640
when you Nev is finally gone when you

1878
01:15:53,050 --> 01:15:56,740
got her sent to prison or whatever your

1879
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:58,840
goal is you're just gonna find a new

1880
01:15:56,740 --> 01:16:01,570
scapegoat to take her place and the

1881
01:15:58,840 --> 01:16:03,280
shame cycle continues the humiliation

1882
01:16:01,570 --> 01:16:05,890
and bullying we've experienced is

1883
01:16:03,280 --> 01:16:07,720
internalizes shame when we project that

1884
01:16:05,890 --> 01:16:10,420
shame onto scapegoats and onto each

1885
01:16:07,720 --> 01:16:13,390
other it becomes cringing and contempt

1886
01:16:10,420 --> 01:16:16,390
and we voice that contempt by shaming

1887
01:16:13,390 --> 01:16:18,430
other people which starts a new cycle so

1888
01:16:16,390 --> 01:16:20,710
you can keep finding new scapegoats new

1889
01:16:18,430 --> 01:16:22,630
punching bags new shame dumps new law

1890
01:16:20,710 --> 01:16:24,610
cows and you can end up like one of the

1891
01:16:22,630 --> 01:16:27,010
people who's been archiving Christian

1892
01:16:24,610 --> 01:16:29,110
for 13 years but that will never really

1893
01:16:27,010 --> 01:16:31,540
heal us God how do I get out of this

1894
01:16:29,110 --> 01:16:33,220
video I'm trying to have a serious

1895
01:16:31,540 --> 01:16:37,020
conversation dressed as some sort of a

1896
01:16:33,220 --> 01:16:41,160
cowgirl degenerate cringe shame I

1897
01:16:37,020 --> 01:16:43,500
don't look at me you know I love wearing

1898
01:16:41,160 --> 01:16:45,930
florals in front of flowers thank you

1899
01:16:43,500 --> 01:16:48,630
yes I suppose it is groundbreaking all

1900
01:16:45,930 --> 01:16:50,910
right children let's review our notes on

1901
01:16:48,630 --> 01:16:52,650
cringe the word cringe really describes

1902
01:16:50,910 --> 01:16:55,140
two different emotions either

1903
01:16:52,650 --> 01:16:57,180
embarrassment or contempt you can feel

1904
01:16:55,140 --> 01:16:59,400
either one for yourself or for someone

1905
01:16:57,180 --> 01:17:01,650
else when you're barest for someone else

1906
01:16:59,400 --> 01:17:03,540
we call that vicarious embarrassment and

1907
01:17:01,650 --> 01:17:05,430
that can mean cringing with someone who

1908
01:17:03,540 --> 01:17:07,560
has embarrassed themselves which I've

1909
01:17:05,430 --> 01:17:09,510
argued is excluded in the internet usage

1910
01:17:07,560 --> 01:17:11,370
of the word cringe or it can be

1911
01:17:09,510 --> 01:17:13,560
embarrassment for someone who isn't

1912
01:17:11,370 --> 01:17:15,690
embarrassed themselves in which case we

1913
01:17:13,560 --> 01:17:17,160
say we're cringing at them now if

1914
01:17:15,690 --> 01:17:19,340
someone who's part of your in-group

1915
01:17:17,160 --> 01:17:21,480
is embarrassing themselves and by proxy

1916
01:17:19,340 --> 01:17:24,390
embarrassing the in-group that includes

1917
01:17:21,480 --> 01:17:26,760
you you feel in-group cringe which can

1918
01:17:24,390 --> 01:17:29,190
involve both vicarious embarrassment and

1919
01:17:26,760 --> 01:17:31,440
a kind of self cringe and on the

1920
01:17:29,190 --> 01:17:32,970
contempt side contempt for someone who

1921
01:17:31,440 --> 01:17:34,710
shares traits in common with you

1922
01:17:32,970 --> 01:17:37,140
particularly if their traits you have

1923
01:17:34,710 --> 01:17:39,180
contempt for in yourself can develop

1924
01:17:37,140 --> 01:17:41,700
into morbid cringe which is that

1925
01:17:39,180 --> 01:17:44,190
obsession with a locale that addiction

1926
01:17:41,700 --> 01:17:46,260
to contemptuous gazing at a dark mirror

1927
01:17:44,190 --> 01:17:48,120
in which you see reflected everything

1928
01:17:46,260 --> 01:17:50,190
you hate about yourself or about your

1929
01:17:48,120 --> 01:17:52,410
in-group now I want to end this video by

1930
01:17:50,190 --> 01:17:52,680
reflecting on whether cringe is good or

1931
01:17:52,410 --> 01:17:55,620
bad

1932
01:17:52,680 --> 01:17:57,630
healthy / harmful and I do think that in

1933
01:17:55,620 --> 01:18:00,060
some situations crunch is good

1934
01:17:57,630 --> 01:18:02,280
embarrassment serves a social purpose

1935
01:18:00,060 --> 01:18:04,770
it helps us interact smoothly with each

1936
01:18:02,280 --> 01:18:06,270
other by telling us what not to do and

1937
01:18:04,770 --> 01:18:08,430
empathizing with other people's

1938
01:18:06,270 --> 01:18:10,200
embarrassing stories can be cathartic it

1939
01:18:08,430 --> 01:18:13,140
can make you feel closer to other people

1940
01:18:10,200 --> 01:18:15,150
more alike less alone I also think a

1941
01:18:13,140 --> 01:18:17,610
moderate amount of self cringe is very

1942
01:18:15,150 --> 01:18:19,170
healthy it shows you're self-aware and

1943
01:18:17,610 --> 01:18:20,760
you care at least a little bit what

1944
01:18:19,170 --> 01:18:22,290
other people think you know I've met

1945
01:18:20,760 --> 01:18:25,470
people who never cringe it themselves

1946
01:18:22,290 --> 01:18:26,040
and let's just say they're not my kind

1947
01:18:25,470 --> 01:18:27,930
of people

1948
01:18:26,040 --> 01:18:29,940
they're narcissists who think super

1949
01:18:27,930 --> 01:18:31,740
highly of themselves regardless of how

1950
01:18:29,940 --> 01:18:33,660
they're actually coming across but I

1951
01:18:31,740 --> 01:18:34,920
think partly out of fear of ending up

1952
01:18:33,660 --> 01:18:37,710
like one of those people

1953
01:18:34,920 --> 01:18:40,440
I've overcompensated and I cringe too

1954
01:18:37,710 --> 01:18:43,050
much both at myself and at other people

1955
01:18:40,440 --> 01:18:45,570
it's a habit that's kind of making me

1956
01:18:43,050 --> 01:18:47,700
hate myself and it's making me unfairly

1957
01:18:45,570 --> 01:18:49,060
contemptuous towards others and when I

1958
01:18:47,700 --> 01:18:51,940
take a look around the inner

1959
01:18:49,060 --> 01:18:54,670
like I've done in this video I find that

1960
01:18:51,940 --> 01:18:55,540
I'm not alone in this situation and it's

1961
01:18:54,670 --> 01:18:58,450
not cute

1962
01:18:55,540 --> 01:19:00,760
so how do we cringe less well the cliche

1963
01:18:58,450 --> 01:19:03,160
solution is self-love which our culture

1964
01:19:00,760 --> 01:19:06,250
places a lot of value on self love and

1965
01:19:03,160 --> 01:19:08,950
self esteem you know I don't care what

1966
01:19:06,250 --> 01:19:10,660
haters and losers say I'm a bad [ __ ] I

1967
01:19:08,950 --> 01:19:13,390
look like a supermodel

1968
01:19:10,660 --> 01:19:15,520
I am a genius we're encouraged to hype

1969
01:19:13,390 --> 01:19:17,650
ourselves up in this way but it doesn't

1970
01:19:15,520 --> 01:19:19,360
work because it's not realistic you

1971
01:19:17,650 --> 01:19:21,220
don't look like a supermodel and you're

1972
01:19:19,360 --> 01:19:23,260
not a genius and when you realize that

1973
01:19:21,220 --> 01:19:25,120
you fall from one extreme to the other

1974
01:19:23,260 --> 01:19:27,400
of what Chris Fleming calls the

1975
01:19:25,120 --> 01:19:30,010
self-esteem Tower of Terror the or

1976
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:32,320
himself love to self hate but self-hate

1977
01:19:30,010 --> 01:19:33,910
is also a distortion recently I was

1978
01:19:32,320 --> 01:19:35,290
listening to a David Foster Wallace

1979
01:19:33,910 --> 01:19:37,510
interview yeah I know

1980
01:19:35,290 --> 01:19:39,400
cringe and he attacked me mercilessly

1981
01:19:37,510 --> 01:19:43,000
and unprovoked there's that there's a

1982
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:45,370
lot of narcissism insult hatred how dare

1983
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:48,490
you notice that I'm in this photo and I

1984
01:19:45,370 --> 01:19:50,830
don't like it but it's true time spent

1985
01:19:48,490 --> 01:19:53,320
cringing out yourself is still time

1986
01:19:50,830 --> 01:19:55,360
spent obsessing over yourself and it's

1987
01:19:53,320 --> 01:19:58,330
hard not to because humans are animals

1988
01:19:55,360 --> 01:20:00,160
so our perspective is egocentric by

1989
01:19:58,330 --> 01:20:02,710
nature but we can still learn to

1990
01:20:00,160 --> 01:20:04,690
appreciate that the world is bigger than

1991
01:20:02,710 --> 01:20:06,310
us I mean I've heard rumours in that

1992
01:20:04,690 --> 01:20:09,280
book we started with cringe-worthy

1993
01:20:06,310 --> 01:20:11,890
Melissa doll advocates not self-love or

1994
01:20:09,280 --> 01:20:13,150
self hate but what she calls self

1995
01:20:11,890 --> 01:20:16,210
indifference

1996
01:20:13,150 --> 01:20:19,630
she says self indifference is the relief

1997
01:20:16,210 --> 01:20:22,510
of realizing that you are simply not

1998
01:20:19,630 --> 01:20:25,420
that big a deal so yeah I was pretty

1999
01:20:22,510 --> 01:20:28,300
crunchy in the past and I'm still pretty

2000
01:20:25,420 --> 01:20:30,670
cringing now but you know what everyone

2001
01:20:28,300 --> 01:20:32,140
else is pretty crunchy too and the world

2002
01:20:30,670 --> 01:20:34,390
is probably going to burn down in 50

2003
01:20:32,140 --> 01:20:36,820
years anyway so I don't know if I would

2004
01:20:34,390 --> 01:20:40,920
call this good news but if it's any

2005
01:20:36,820 --> 01:20:44,699
consolation nothing matters

2006
01:20:40,920 --> 01:20:49,160
nothing matters nothing matters nothing

2007
01:20:44,699 --> 01:20:54,210
matters nothing matters nothing matters

2008
01:20:49,160 --> 01:20:58,730
nothing matters nothing matters nothing

2009
