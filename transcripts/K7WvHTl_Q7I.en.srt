all right children it's a new decade

3
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:22,480
it's time to face the facts how do I put

4
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:24,439
this delicately your humble Hostess is a

5
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:27,720
total

00:00:24,439 --> 00:00:30,119
Les shame you're probably worried this

7
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:33,600
is a coming out video and I'm sorry to

8
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:35,840
tell you that it is but oh it's it's so

9
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,800
much worse than just that you know one

10
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:41,320
coming out May Be regarded as a

11
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:43,600
misfortune two looks like carelessness

12
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:45,760
and three well at that point you're just

13
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,680
doing it for attention and I do love

14
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:51,199
attention I want to be very clear about

15
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:53,160
that but I also happen to be gay some

16
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:55,359
gay people love attention it's been

17
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:57,800
known to happen so there Comes A Time in

18
00:00:55,359 --> 00:01:00,359
a woman's life when you have to take a

19
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:03,399
step back look yourself in the mirror

20
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:05,479
and admit this is some highkey Les

21
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:08,200
vitious behavior and I'm going to talk

22
00:01:05,479 --> 00:01:10,040

exposed graphic the tea is piping hot

28
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:23,560
for a long time on this channel the

29
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:25,520
official story has been that I'm by I'm

30
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:27,759
a super [Â __Â ] byy but I haven't dated

31
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,960
women since I transitioned and for a

32
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:31,520
while there I got pretty deep into the

33
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:34,799
the straight lifestyle this really

34
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:37,320
started in 2018 by that summer I had

35
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:40,479
privately convinced myself that I was a

36
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:42,360
fully heterosexual woman and we're going

37
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:44,280
to circle back to how I reached that

38
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:47,399
conclusion but I'm starting in the

39
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:50,119
middle of things I'm like an epic poet

40
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:52,719
hey Muse hey how are you Gorge so at the

41
00:01:50,119 --> 00:01:54,759
beginning of 2018 I became close friends

42
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:57,600
I'd even say best friends with a woman

43
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:57,600
whom style

44
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:03,920
call Joanne light of my life can we get

45
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:05,240
some melodramatic music please yeah here

46
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,759
we go you're going to want to pour

47
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:09,560
yourself a glass of something nice I

48
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:11,840
want you to fully enjoy my pain so my

49
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:13,720
friendship with Joanne got very intense

50
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,280
very fast it was that kind of friendship

51
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:17,440
where you develop your own private

52
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,120
language of references and in jokes and

53
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,959
you drive everyone around you crazy with

54
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,400
your unintelligible banter we'd call

55
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:24,160
each other pretty much every day and

56
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,640
we'd talk for hours and I don't think

57
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,280
I've ever called her and not been

58
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:30,040
laughing or smiling in the first 20

59
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:32,640
seconds which is very unusual for me cuz

60
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:34,360
I am a weird and I don't get along that

61
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,680
well with that many people one reason we

62
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:39,000
got so emotionally close is we're both

63
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:40,560
trans and there's a kind of intuitive

64
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,560
understanding and a sense of humor that

65
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,280
I can share with another trans woman

66
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,959
that I can't really have with anyone

67
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:50,519
else oh and by the way Joanne also

68
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:53,120
happens to be just angelically beautiful

69
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:54,840
which I did notice every time I looked

70
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,680
at her and from the beginning of this

71
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:59,599
relationship it wasn't sexual but it

72
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,400
wasn't exactly platonic either we'd get

73
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:04,040
drunk drunk make out we'd sleep in the

74
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:07,879
same bed and cuddle Straight girls do

75
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:09,840
that right G Pals I remember one of the

76
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:11,360
first times I hung out with Joanne we we

77
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,640
got our nails done together and that

78
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,959
night we were bar hopping and she took

79
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:17,319
my pretty hand and her pretty hand and

80
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:20,480
we walked down the street together

81
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:22,360
holding hands this is this is garbage

82
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,000
and I want to die I hope you all know

83
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:25,959
that that I'm an Agony later we were at

84
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,799
a bar table with friends and every time

85
00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:31,680
one of us needed a drink we'd run off to

86
00:03:27,799 --> 00:03:33,280
the bar and she'd secretly kiss me ah

87
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,720
it's this still one of the most magical

88
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,879
gay things that's ever happened to me

89
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:39,080
Joan had a boyfriend at the time but he

90
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:41,159
didn't care a lot of men think girls

91
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:42,640
kissing is hot but they don't take it

92
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:44,480
seriously they don't think it could ever

93
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:47,040
mean anything or lead to a real

94
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:49,560
relationship G

95
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:52,599
Pals just kill me take me out behind the

96
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:54,560
shed put me down humanely and just buy a

97
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:56,920
new YouTuber before the kids get home

98
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,720
and they won't notice so this very

99
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:01,000
intimate friendship went on for about a

100
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:03,920
year without me acknowledging to Joanne

101
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,959
or to myself that I was falling in love

102
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:08,599
so Not only was I in denial about being

103
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:10,879
in love with her but at the same time I

104
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:13,560
had basically convinced myself that I

105
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:15,920
only wanted to date men so how could I

106
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:18,880
possibly think that well the short

107
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:22,360
answer is shame why is no one talking

108
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:24,639
about the shame I was so ashamed of my

109
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:25,759
attraction to women there were days I

110
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,600
thought the shame was going to crush me

111
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:30,840
to death oh I wanted to be straight so

112
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:32,840
bad and let no no one say I didn't make

113
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:35,360
a strong attempt there should honestly

114
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:37,600
be a statue of me sucking dick in the

115
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:40,479
town square with the inscription here

116
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:43,039
nelt Natalie win attempted heterosexual

117
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:45,440
I'm a bronze star lesbian well if we're

118
00:04:43,039 --> 00:04:48,440
really being honest I don't think I get

119
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:51,199
a star oh I was desperate to be straight

120
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:54,400
I tried prayer I tried electric shocks

121
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:56,000
all the classics all the hits you know

122
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,680
the idea is if you shock yourself every

123
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,280
time you think about women you start to

124
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,600
associate the two in your head so now

125
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,880
I'm a lesan and I enjoy electric

126
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,280
[Music]

127
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,639
shocks this is supposed to hurt but I

128
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,720
just feel like I'm on a road trip with

129
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,320
Kate Blanchet so at some point the shame

130
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,919
was just too much for me and it

131
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:15,400
literally broke my brain I no longer

132
00:05:12,919 --> 00:05:17,639
wanted to be straight I simply duded

133
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:21,000
myself into thinking I was straight

134
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:23,240
maybe a little by a little bit by that

135
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,280
time I started dating men and I got into

136
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:27,000
a serious long-term relationship with a

137
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:29,000
man and at first I explained away my

138
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,639
feelings for Joanne by telling myself

139
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,400
female friends ship are just really

140
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:35,319
intense that's probably why I feel so

141
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:38,160
strongly and everyone thinks women are

142
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:40,600
beautiful so it's only natural I notice

143
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:43,520
that and you

144
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:46,240
know spend a lot of time thinking about

145
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:48,199
it so this nonsense went on until the

146
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,720
beginning of last year and then two

147
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:52,430
things happened first Joanne started

148
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:56,869
dating a CIS

149
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:56,869
[Music]

150
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:03,360
lesbian [Â __Â ] my drve right I think

151
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:05,360
before that I always knew she was by but

152
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,639
some combination of self-interested

153
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:10,039
denial and B phobia allowed me to write

154
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:11,919
off my initial crush on her as I just

155
00:06:10,039 --> 00:06:13,960
have a thing for my Straight best friend

156
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:15,599
like who doesn't but that's a very

157
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:17,360
self-serving narrative because it

158
00:06:15,599 --> 00:06:19,720
quarantines your feelings inside the

159
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,520
safety of unattainable fantasy and it

160
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:23,319
Wards off the pain of potential

161
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:25,560
rejection cuz that way it's not really

162
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:27,319
me she's rejecting it's just she's just

163
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:29,840
not that into women but once she started

164
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:33,319
dating women I couldn't tell myself that

165
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:35,599
anymore and the jealousy hit me so hard

166
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:37,720
I I couldn't ignore it second around

167
00:06:35,599 --> 00:06:40,000
that same time Joanne decided to visit

168
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:41,360
me for a few weeks it was a longdistance

169
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,000
friendship and about halfway through

170
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:48,319
that visit I cracked one morning I woke

171
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:51,319
up next to her G pal and I looked at her

172
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:53,319
pretty [Â __Â ] face and I had the

173
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:56,479
thought I want to wake up next to you

174
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:58,440
every day of my life and that is a

175
00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:00,800
pretty alarming thought for a petite

176
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:04,199
heterosexual bio girl to have about her

177
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:05,840
galp pal oh never in my life have I

178
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:08,080
fallen so deeply in love with someone

179
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:10,440
like what the [Â __Â ] is this what am I

180
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:12,919
feeling I was experiencing an intensity

181
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:16,440
of emotion that has no right to exist

182
00:07:12,919 --> 00:07:18,879
outside of 19th century Italian opera so

183
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:22,160
I confessed my feelings to Joanne and

184
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:24,720
love confession gone wrong

185
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:28,160
devastating she did not reciprocate my

186
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:30,720
feelings nurse my pain is at a 10 I need

187
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,319
more pills need this to say my heart was

188
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,000
shattered I cried a sea of Tears blah

189
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:36,280
blah blah I'm sure we all know how that

190
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,039
goes and here's the thing if we'd taken

191
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:40,919
a 3-month friendship break right then

192
00:07:38,039 --> 00:07:42,479
and there I might have recovered but we

193
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:44,639
couldn't keep away from each other she

194
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:46,879
wasn't in love with me but she must have

195
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:49,759
been in something with me because the

196
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:52,240
truth is we were never just gal Pals and

197
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:54,520
I was Beyond Reason like I probably

198
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,479
would have started one of those lesbian

199
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:58,240
couple joint Instagram accounts that's

200
00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:00,240
how tragic this got those are great by

201
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,560
the way pay no attention to Queens so

202
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,720
for the rest of 2019 Joanne and I kept

203
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,720
talking kept visiting each other and I

204
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,400
just repeated this heartbreak again and

205
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,759
again and again now if she had

206
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:12,319
reciprocated my feelings I probably

207
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:13,639
would have come out as gay last year

208
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:15,759
because the heat of a romantic

209
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:18,120
relationship has a way of evaporating

210
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:20,240
shame but rejection and heartbreak are

211
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:22,800
shameful in themselves and only made the

212
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:25,560
situation worse so I spent most of 2019

213
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,960
going in and out of denial until finally

214
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:29,759
last October I got super [Â __Â ]

215
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:31,599
canceled on Twitter as disussed in my

216
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:34,159
last video link in the description

217
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:35,640
subscribe and at the same time Joanne

218
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:37,800
realized that she was going to have to

219
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:39,440
be the one to enforce a friendship break

220
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:41,120
otherwise I was never going to get over

221
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,760
her so there was this combination of

222
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,720
things being politically canceled by

223
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:47,519
Twitter being romantically canceled by

224
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:50,640
Joanne and also losing her as my closest

225
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:52,600
friend which sent me into this catatonic

226
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,440
Rock Bottom kind of depression and of

227
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:57,160
course depression is a terrible thing

228
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:59,040
but I think it can also serve a purpose

229
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:01,279
because depression brings your life to a

230
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:04,000
stance still and in the quiet of that

231
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:06,279
stand still you sometimes feel outside

232
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,560
yourself and with that comes A New

233
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:10,440
Perspective so last December when I was

234
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,680
lying around drinking white claw all day

235
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:15,120
and binge watching Orange Is The Bluest

236
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:17,760
L word I actually didn't feel so much

237
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:19,440
shame anymore and that gave me a new

238
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:22,000
kind of clarity I looked back on the

239
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:24,839
last couple years and saw that I'd been

240
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,040
avoiding the obvious so that's what it

241
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:32,650
took for me to finally face the fact

242
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:52,120
that I am a uh I am a gay not

243
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:56,079
[Music]

244
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:59,519
clickbait Adam's a great guy and all but

245
00:09:56,079 --> 00:09:59,519
I want Lilith

246
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:02,760
[Music]

247
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:08,800
shame this Floral Fantasy is a little

248
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:11,920
less mother of mankind and a little more

249
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:14,920
Coachella 2015 well that's my Eden candy

250
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:17,040
flipping I love it okay let's Circle

251
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:18,800
back and talk about how a wholesome homo

252
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:21,000
like me wound up in the clutches of the

253
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,839
straight agenda it starts with denial

254
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,200
and there's two sides to gay denial

255
00:10:22,839 --> 00:10:25,800
first there was a period where I

256
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:27,640
repressed or explained away my

257
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:29,320
attraction to women female friendships

258
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:31,720
are just really intense straight girl

259
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:33,640
girls have girl crushes too and second I

260
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:35,600
experienced and acted on what I

261
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:37,519
genuinely thought was sexual and

262
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,240
romantic attraction to men and to be

263
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:40,880
honest I'm still kind of struggling to

264
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:42,680
make sense of all this maybe I'm not

265
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:45,120
quite ready to make this video but I'm

266
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:47,160
afraid that if I don't the shame will

267
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:49,959
overpower me again and I'll slide back

268
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:52,320
into denial so while I'm still thinking

269
00:10:49,959 --> 00:10:54,839
semi clearly let me talk you through the

270
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,760
struggle because like most queer people

271
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:58,880
I find nothing more fascinating than an

272
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:01,680
in-depth analysis of my own personality

273
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:03,480
she's Libra so in 2017 I started taking

274
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,279
feminizing hormones and most people are

275
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:07,839
aware of the more obvious effects of

276
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:10,880
that like it makes you grow breaths at

277
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:12,279
least in theory I just added

278
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,880
progesterone we'll see if that does

279
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:15,519
anything but the Lesser known thing is

280
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:17,560
it has some pretty major effects on your

281
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:19,079
mood and your sexuality the first few

282
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:21,760
months I was on hormones I actually

283
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:24,279
wondered if I was now asexual because

284
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:26,760
the libido I had known before was just

285
00:11:24,279 --> 00:11:29,920
gone but I'm very much not asexual it

286
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:33,079
just took me a while to adjust to an

287
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:35,480
endocrinologically female sex drive one

288
00:11:33,079 --> 00:11:38,519
of the differences for me is it's not as

289
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:41,079
obvious now whom I'm attracted too just

290
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:43,600
looking at an attractive person well

291
00:11:41,079 --> 00:11:46,000
let's put it this way it sparks my

292
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,920
interest but it doesn't Light My Fire

293
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,360
it's not the instant Inferno that is

294
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:52,600
testosterone fueled lust it's a slow

295
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:55,320
burn that has to be built up some people

296
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:58,120
call this Demi seexual which is a term

297
00:11:55,320 --> 00:12:00,320
I'm ambivalent about but I think the

298
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:02,360
concept it described applies to me like

299
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,600
I form little crushes on People based on

300
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:06,000
watching their YouTube videos or

301
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,839
whatever but I don't feel intense sexual

302
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,560
attraction to anyone until I've gotten

303
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:11,240
close to them as a friend so I have a

304
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:13,199
hard time getting too excited about

305
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:15,639
casual dating you know can't I just find

306
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:18,199
a new best friend fall insanely in love

307
00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:19,760
with her and then get gay married I know

308
00:12:18,199 --> 00:12:22,519
that's not how it works I have to play

309
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:24,480
the field I also think it's a reason I

310
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:27,079
don't really like porn that much because

311
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:30,279
sex without context is just mechanics to

312
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:31,959
me it's boring the build up of desire

313
00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:34,560
that's the interesting part and the

314
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:37,519
struggle between desire and shame I

315
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:39,880
shouldn't but I want to that's how you

316
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:42,680
build a plotline kids I'm also guessing

317
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:44,680
this kind of slow burn sexuality is more

318
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:47,160
common in women than men and I wonder if

319
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:49,279
that's a reason why gay men tend to know

320
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:50,800
they're gay at an earlier age than gay

321
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:52,839
women when you have teenage boy

322
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,880
testosterone levels it's harder to be

323
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:57,120
agnostic or mistaken about who you're

324
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:59,199
attracted to whereas there's a lot of

325
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,279
gay women who don't realize they're gay

326
00:12:59,199 --> 00:13:03,399
until they're in their 30s or even later

327
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:05,680
and thank God for them they make me feel

328
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:07,800
less bad about my wasted youth so it's

329
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:09,800
hard for me to use visual sexual

330
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:11,760
interest as a guide to my sexuality

331
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:13,959
because I do feel aesthetic attraction

332
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:15,440
towards Beautiful People of any gender

333
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:17,560
and that can be pretty intense in its

334
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:20,680
own right I guess the difference for me

335
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:23,000
is looking at a beautiful woman is more

336
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:25,240
emotionally captivating to me than

337
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,079
looking at a beautiful man which can be

338
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:31,079
moving in its own way but it's more like

339
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:34,720
the way I'm moved by by I don't know the

340
00:13:31,079 --> 00:13:36,880
paron you know is sturdy symmetrical has

341
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,800
impressive columns it's not to say it's

342
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:41,279
totally asexual I mean I'd [Â __Â ] the

343
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:43,680
Parthenon I'd [Â __Â ] it so hard I admit I

344
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:46,199
do have some kind of erotic fascination

345
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:48,360
with masculinity and maybe that stems

346
00:13:46,199 --> 00:13:51,040
from my pre-transition sense of having

347
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:52,240
failed at masculinity so I'm mesmerized

348
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,560
by the real thing there's something

349
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:58,600
about the contrast between me and a

350
00:13:54,560 --> 00:14:00,920
masculine man that's sexually intriguing

351
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:05,320
to me like I've sometimes pleasantly

352
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:10,560
gasped at the feeling of hairy muscly

353
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:12,680
arms enfolding my smooth fragile body or

354
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:15,440
maybe it's more Freudian the masculine

355
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:17,639
man as Daddy the archetypal father the

356
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,399
symbolic power of the phace penetration

357
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:21,000
is the ultimate expression of desire and

358
00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:23,560
possession there's a lot of sexual

359
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,600
connotations to manhood and I think

360
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:28,120
that's why I can look at a sexy man and

361
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:30,040
create plausible fantasies in my head

362
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:32,279
where I'd absolutely enjoy letting him

363
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:34,800
do things to me and I can find things I

364
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:37,639
like about male bodies like uh they're

365
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:39,399
very warm uh I love it when you get

366
00:14:37,639 --> 00:14:41,279
under the covers with a man and he warms

367
00:14:39,399 --> 00:14:43,360
you up but that's when the lesbian voice

368
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:46,759
comes into my head and she says but are

369
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:49,040
you attracted to men or do you just like

370
00:14:46,759 --> 00:14:50,759
being warm my attraction to women is

371
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:54,360
very different I look at a beautiful

372
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:55,720
woman and it's just like Oh no you're

373
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:58,600
gorgeous you're

374
00:14:55,720 --> 00:15:00,320
beautiful this is going to destroy me

375
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:02,120
you know what can actually be painful

376
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:04,320
how beautiful a woman is I've never once

377
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:06,440
been in pain over male Beauty but around

378
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,160
Joanne once I was open about my feelings

379
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:09,839
and things got bad there'd be moments

380
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,600
I'd have to just look away from her and

381
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:13,240
be like don't even enter my line of

382
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,240
sight right now you're too beautiful I

383
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:17,199
can't stand it there's a kind of sick

384
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:19,480
masochism and wanting someone who

385
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:21,639
doesn't want you back it's insatiable

386
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:23,880
like an addiction and on the flip side

387
00:15:21,639 --> 00:15:26,279
there's an intense erotic thrill in

388
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:28,279
being desired I think that's what got me

389
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:29,480
interested in men in the first place

390
00:15:28,279 --> 00:15:32,720
it's that they

391
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:35,880
interested in me and that's pretty

392
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:37,839
interesting I've felt desired by men in

393
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:40,360
a way I've never truly felt desired by

394
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:43,319
women you know a man will glow at you

395
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:46,000
with that agitated carnivorous

396
00:15:43,319 --> 00:15:48,959
desperation [Â __Â ] me up King God that's

397
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:52,000
hot gets me every time but notice how

398
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:55,319
excitement at the attention the flattery

399
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:58,160
of being desired is not the same thing

400
00:15:55,319 --> 00:16:01,680
as attraction to men you know there's a

401
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:04,199
difference between I want you and I like

402
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:06,120
that you want me but for a long time I

403
00:16:04,199 --> 00:16:08,600
confused one for the other and one

404
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:11,839
reason I was able to do that is that the

405
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:15,279
normative sexual role for women is to be

406
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:18,680
pursued possessed desired seduced

407
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:20,720
dominated by men it's all very passive

408
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:23,079
and in most of the sexual encounters

409
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:26,560
I've had with men I've taken a very

410
00:16:23,079 --> 00:16:28,639
submissive role sometimes I just submit

411
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:31,279
to the glower and let him do things to

412
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:34,680
me and I do think that the thrill of

413
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:36,680
being desired is a valid thing to want I

414
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:38,600
like that feeling myself and I do

415
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:40,639
genuinely enjoy taking on a more

416
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:42,839
submissive role sometimes but you have

417
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:46,480
to go about it thoughtfully because if

418
00:16:42,839 --> 00:16:49,440
you don't sexual submission can be a way

419
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:52,480
to avoid confronting what your desires

420
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:53,839
actually are it's freedom from freedom

421
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,600
and if you're ashamed of your sexual

422
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:57,959
orientation and ashamed of your

423
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:00,360
transsexual body and ashamed of having

424
00:16:57,959 --> 00:17:02,319
any sexual feeling at all because of

425
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:04,319
stigma about trans women being

426
00:17:02,319 --> 00:17:06,559
fetishists then relinquishing

427
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:09,039
responsibility for your own desires by

428
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:11,839
letting someone else take control can be

429
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:13,760
the only way you can enjoy sex at all

430
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:15,839
and for a while it was almost the only

431
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:18,199
way I could enjoy it and I was able to

432
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:20,280
convince myself that was normal because

433
00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:22,520
the sexual situation of a lot of sis

434
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:25,120
straight women isn't really that much

435
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:27,679
more liberated like I Read 50 Shades of

436
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:30,200
Gray years ago and totally identified

437
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:33,080
with the fantasy and later I thought

438
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:34,919
that was evidence I had normative female

439
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:36,720
desires never mind that I was

440
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:38,440
identifying with the midlife crisis

441
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,679
fantasies of a repressed English

442
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:42,880
housewife Longing To Be brutalized by a

443
00:17:40,679 --> 00:17:45,360
capitalist Tyrant I mean not to shame

444
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:47,360
women who genuinely do enjoy a healthier

445
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:49,360
version of that fantasy I think a lot of

446
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:51,440
women pointlessly suffer under a kind of

447
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:53,960
feminist guilt about that but what makes

448
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:56,559
me different is that for me submission

449
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:58,600
to a man was simply the only way I could

450
00:17:56,559 --> 00:18:00,400
enjoy sex without shame and that's a lot

451
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:03,039
of what what I did for a couple years

452
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:05,280
even though my real sexual attraction is

453
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:08,960
to women whereas even in the most

454
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:11,240
patriarchal situation straight women are

455
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:13,960
ultimately attracted to men and sexually

456
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:16,200
aroused by male bodies or are they gay

457
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:18,760
men certainly are and gay women are just

458
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:21,720
rapaic about women but a lot of straight

459
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:24,760
women are just kind of n about male

460
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:29,039
bodies and men in general which what is

461
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:31,640
that about I just I just do not stand

462
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:33,480
straight women I don't think I ever will

463
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:35,400
and that's okay I'm just going to accept

464
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:38,000
my bewilderment and move on with my

465
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:41,440
lesbian life now what I've been giving

466
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:44,039
you so far is a retrospective analysis

467
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,960
an autopsy of my romantic failings of

468
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:47,080
the last 2 years but you have to

469
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:49,039
understand that when I was living

470
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:51,000
through this I experienced it very

471
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:53,520
differently because I didn't have these

472
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,320
insights so I wasn't thinking oh I'm not

473
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:57,360
really attracted to men but I enjoy the

474
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:59,440
thrill of being desired by them so I'm

475
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:01,080
going to pursue that to dist ract myself

476
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:04,039
from how ashamed I am of my attraction

477
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:06,080
to women no subconsciously I put my

478
00:19:04,039 --> 00:19:08,480
attraction to women on mute at least

479
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:10,559
until Joanne ruined my life and I

480
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,320
genuinely thought I was attracted to men

481
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:14,840
which was a lot more than just a

482
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:16,760
frivolous sexual fantasy I had a serious

483
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:19,840
long-term boyfriend for a year and a

484
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:23,840
half who I had very genuine feelings for

485
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:25,799
plot twist story time so my ex-boyfriend

486
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:30,840
let's call

487
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:33,080
him Chad oh and he was a chad like full

488
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:35,919
gigachad fantasy you know he was very

489
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:38,120
masculine taller than me objectively

490
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:39,520
attractive very Charming straight women

491
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:41,200
used to tell me all the time they were

492
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:44,440
jealous of me for being with him and

493
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:47,280
obviously I loved that to me Chad

494
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:50,120
represented almost an ideal of manhood a

495
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:52,760
sort of archetypal romantic lead who

496
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:54,880
swept me off my feet and fulfilled my

497
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:56,559
sick fantasies of being a heterosexual

498
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,720
woman now you probably think I'm going

499
00:19:56,559 --> 00:20:00,840
to say that he was just an abstract fan

500
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:03,360
FY to me but that once it came to

501
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:05,760
actually dating I realized I didn't like

502
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:08,000
it but honestly it's more complicated

503
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:10,320
than that like at the beginning I was

504
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,520
the one who pursued him and I still

505
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:15,240
think of him as the one genuine Boy

506
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:17,320
Crush of my life when we started dating

507
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:18,960
it was really exciting I'd never had a

508
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:21,039
boyfriend before and he'd never been

509
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:24,320
with a transom before and we had this

510
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:26,799
like adorably hetosexual energy together

511
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:28,440
like holding hands in the park it was

512
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:30,679
cute this would be a better lesbian

513
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:33,080
story story if Chad was a cad but he

514
00:20:30,679 --> 00:20:35,440
wasn't he was great he took very good

515
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:37,720
care of me he was never ashamed to be

516
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:40,280
seen with me or of his friends and

517
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:43,320
family knowing he was dating me which if

518
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:45,159
you're a transom that's a huge deal he

519
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:48,600
was a lot less ashamed of me than I am

520
00:20:45,159 --> 00:20:53,640
of myself and when I was with him I

521
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:56,240
wasn't ashamed and that meant a lot so I

522
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:58,640
really wanted this to work like if I was

523
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:01,120
going to be with a man he was the one

524
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:03,520
won and for a year or so I thought it

525
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:06,280
was working I enjoyed the time we spent

526
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:08,600
together I missed him when he was gone I

527
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:10,640
told him I loved him and I meant it but

528
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:13,279
what happened is by the end of the first

529
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:16,080
year the initial excitement had died

530
00:21:13,279 --> 00:21:17,279
down and while Chad was ready to keep

531
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:20,480
escalating the

532
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:23,120
relationship I was realizing that

533
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:25,039
something was very seriously emotionally

534
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:27,279
wrong on my end there was something

535
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:29,159
missing and when I realized I was in

536
00:21:27,279 --> 00:21:31,919
love with Joan

537
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:34,200
I was like there's that missing feeling

538
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:38,320
and I started to understand what my

539
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:40,760
problem was then last full I posted to

540
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:43,720
Instagram an aloof picture of me with

541
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:45,640
the caption do I actually like men or do

542
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:47,240
I just like attention and I didn't mean

543
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:49,159
anything serious by that I was just

544
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:50,360
joking around you know you can post

545
00:21:49,159 --> 00:21:52,559
something like that and a bunch of

546
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:53,840
straight women will respond like yeah

547
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:56,520
[Â __Â ]

548
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:58,320
men what is their damage well they're

549
00:21:56,520 --> 00:22:00,440
stuck dating men that's their damage but

550
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:02,600
if few people left comments saying oh

551
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:04,559
are you making a video about compet you

552
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:07,520
should make a video about compat and I

553
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:10,039
was like what the [Â __Â ] is compet so I

554
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:12,760
Googled it and I learned that compet is

555
00:22:10,039 --> 00:22:14,320
short for compulsory heterosexuality

556
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:17,039
basically it's the idea that

557
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:19,039
heterosexuality is socially required of

558
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:21,200
women and it's so bound up with the

559
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:24,039
conventional idea of what it even means

560
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:26,520
to be a woman that gay women often

561
00:22:24,039 --> 00:22:28,520
mistakenly believe for years that

562
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:30,559
they're attracted to men and this Google

563
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:33,200
gole search led me to a Reddit post

564
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:36,640
called the Amia lesbian Master do and

565
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:39,880
I'm reading through this post like oh no

566
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:41,840
this sounds terribly familiar quote

567
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:44,760
compulsory heterosexuality is the voice

568
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:47,440
in my head that says I must really be H

569
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:49,320
even when I'm in love with a woman quote

570
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:51,440
you have every reason to be happy in

571
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:53,640
your relationship with a man but you

572
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:55,320
just aren't everything is going really

573
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:57,440
well but something is missing and you

574
00:22:55,320 --> 00:23:00,000
can't figure out what so next thing you

575
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:02,279
know I'm doing heila shots at 3:00 a.m.

576
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,600
and taking Ami lesbian internet quizzes

577
00:23:02,279 --> 00:23:06,240
that were clearly designed for

578
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:08,520
13-year-olds and I'm fully a 31-year-old

579
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:11,480
transexual taking this quiz like it's

580
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:13,720
true Samantha was right I am a total

581
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:15,799
lesz all the cisg people watching this

582
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:17,520
video probably want to kill me right now

583
00:23:15,799 --> 00:23:20,000
cuz y'all figured this [Â __Â ] out in high

584
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:22,720
school and I'm sitting here in my 30s

585
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,679
like it's just I just I just can't I

586
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:27,039
just well can I be a melodramatic baby

587
00:23:24,679 --> 00:23:29,200
gay for 30 minutes of my lifetime please

588
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:32,000
is that all right with you the

589
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:34,159
so to be honest I still experience

590
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,919
compet thoughts and Fantasies like for a

591
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:38,720
long time I've had what seemed to be

592
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:40,440
romantic fantasies about marrying a man

593
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:42,919
but after a lot of introspection I've

594
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:45,600
realized that this is not really a

595
00:23:42,919 --> 00:23:48,440
fantasy of private happiness and

596
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:51,320
fulfillment it's a fantasy of social

597
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:54,799
Prestige and acceptance like can you

598
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:57,960
imagine if I got married to a tall

599
00:23:54,799 --> 00:24:00,159
handsome man at an opulent wedding with

600
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:02,600
lots of photographers posting to

601
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:05,200
Instagram ah I'd be Queen of the

602
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:07,480
[Â __Â ] I'd be super heck and valid ooo

603
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:09,640
but I don't actually want to be married

604
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:12,080
I want to get married I want to have a

605
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:14,760
wedding basically I want to wear a

606
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:17,600
wedding dress I want attention Okay

607
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:20,159
please pay pay attention to me so I can

608
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:22,679
totally deconstruct the fantasy but is

609
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:25,200
still really hard for me to let it go I

610
00:24:22,679 --> 00:24:27,559
cling to the reassuring Conformity of

611
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:30,360
heterosexuality because there's a level

612
00:24:27,559 --> 00:24:32,600
of gender ins ability and deviancy

613
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:35,360
that's inherent to homosexuality and

614
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:38,200
until recently I wasn't secure enough in

615
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:40,720
my gender to handle that lesbianism is a

616
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:42,440
very advanced form of Womanhood and I

617
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:44,559
think I needed to go through the more

618
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:46,919
101 straight girl experience before

619
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:49,279
attempting anything as difficult as that

620
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:51,440
I still have a hard time imagining a

621
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:53,600
happy future for myself as a woman

622
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:55,440
partnered to a woman and I think that's

623
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:58,440
partly because good lesbian

624
00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:00,799
representation in media is so sparse the

625
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:04,080
best we have is a Showtime melodrama

626
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:06,480
from 15 years ago which I do like and I

627
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:09,240
like the new one too but after that the

628
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:11,559
runner up is I mean maybe not the

629
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:13,600
lesbian representation we need it's a

630
00:25:11,559 --> 00:25:16,080
YouTube show about two drag queens whom

631
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:18,039
we ship well I don't ship them because I

632
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:20,679
have a fully lesbian parasocial internet

633
00:25:18,039 --> 00:25:23,760
crush on kacha zala don't laugh at me

634
00:25:20,679 --> 00:25:25,039
she's smart she's funny she's beautiful

635
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:27,200
that's everything I'm looking for in a

636
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:28,840
woman sure some haters and losers will

637
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,960
probably try to convince me that katcha

638
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:33,000
is in fact a homosexual man posing as a

639
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:35,000
woman but you know what this is a super

640
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,360
[Â __Â ] vulnerable moment in my life and

641
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,960
I don't need this right

642
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:43,600
now I need to be touched by a real woman

643
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:45,640
I'm I'm losing my goddamn mind it's so

644
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:47,840
deeply embedded in our culture that

645
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:49,559
marrying a man is the end goal of

646
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:53,200
Womanhood and it's not just Disney

647
00:25:49,559 --> 00:25:55,919
movies like it's the Bible it's Greek

648
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:57,799
mythology German fairy tales Victorian

649
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:59,600
novels the whole weight of cultural

650
00:25:57,799 --> 00:26:01,919
history is is telling you that what it

651
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:03,919
means to succeed as a woman is to marry

652
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:06,880
a man and if you're already super

653
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:09,799
dysphoric and insecure about your gender

654
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:12,399
than to reject that possibility ah it

655
00:26:09,799 --> 00:26:14,360
hurts it hurts so bad but whenever I

656
00:26:12,399 --> 00:26:16,320
think about having a long-term partner

657
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:19,080
you know not the wedding day but the

658
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:21,799
1,000th morning waking up

659
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:24,520
together I can only imagine her being a

660
00:26:21,799 --> 00:26:27,960
woman my brain wants a good man to take

661
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:30,200
care of me but my heart wants a high

662
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:32,200
mainten and stea to ruin my life and

663
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:34,640
once I knew that for

664
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:38,000
sure I thought it would be wrong to stay

665
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:42,559
with Chad and this man was like my hinge

666
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,559
he was holding me together but last

667
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:48,799
December I broke up with him because I'm

668
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:52,840
a lesbian

669
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:52,840
which at least is a good

670
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:58,640
reason I'm having a hard time you guys

671
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:00,480
leave your pity in the comments and I'm

672
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:02,120
starting to regret eating this fruit too

673
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:04,279
I feel like [Â __Â ] I think it's the loss

674
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:05,799
of My Immortal Soul Weighing on me I

675
00:27:04,279 --> 00:27:07,840
could really use a couple Advil and a

676
00:27:05,799 --> 00:27:11,640
vodka tonic I think I might throw some

677
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:11,640
clothes on too where's that

678
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:18,640
[Music]

679
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:23,919
snake I already missed my heterosexual

680
00:27:22,039 --> 00:27:26,320
Nails I know these are too long to be

681
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:28,200
gay but baby steps okay this is hard for

682
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:29,320
me getting my acrylics removed

683
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,960
traumatizing I feel like I'm

684
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:32,559
de-transitioning one of these days I

685
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,559
will do the lesbian manicure with

686
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:36,240
acrylics on eight fingers I just have to

687
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:39,520
find the courage to walk into a salon

688
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:43,159
and say hi I'm a homosexual please I

689
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:46,279
want two short nails so I can [Â __Â ]

690
00:27:43,159 --> 00:27:47,399
[Â __Â ] shame let's talk about the shame

691
00:27:46,279 --> 00:27:50,360
before I was

692
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:52,840
transgendered I really only dated women

693
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:55,120
though two of those women later turned

694
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:56,720
out to be trans so I guess we had some

695
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:58,919
way of finding each other an attraction

696
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:01,519
to women was never really a problem for

697
00:27:58,919 --> 00:28:03,320
me before the transgendering because I

698
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:05,279
was raised in an alternative lifestyle

699
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:07,240
where men are supposed to be attracted

700
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:11,000
to women crazy I know not that I'm a

701
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:13,039
newcomer to shame because oh sweaty I

702
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,760
was doing plenty of things that men are

703
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:16,440
not supposed to do and before I

704
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:18,720
transitioned my shame was centered

705
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:20,840
around my being at the time a gender

706
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:22,919
non-conforming man which in my early

707
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:25,720
YouTube videos I dealt with by

708
00:28:22,919 --> 00:28:27,880
caricaturing myself and basically

709
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:30,720
leaning into the public humiliation one

710
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:32,360
of my my classic techniques but now my

711
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:34,880
shame is centered around my failure to

712
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:37,440
be a socially acceptable woman and the

713
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:40,080
most glaring aspects of that failure are

714
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:43,279
my male past my sexual

715
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:45,120
orientation and the severed human heads

716
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:47,159
in my refrigerator yeah killing all

717
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:50,240
those people was not my most feminine

718
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:52,080
moment but I was having a bad skin day

719
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:54,320
what was I supposed to do so there's two

720
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:57,519
problems that kind of multiply together

721
00:28:54,320 --> 00:29:00,960
one I'm ashamed of being trans two I'm

722
00:28:57,519 --> 00:29:04,440
ashamed of being a lesbian and whatever

723
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:09,360
1 time 2 is I'm really ashamed of being

724
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:11,960
a trans lesbian GH and it's difficult

725
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:14,159
and risky for me to admit these feelings

726
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:16,640
because visible queer people are

727
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:18,679
supposed to perform Pride why is no one

728
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:21,600
talking about the shame because we are

729
00:29:18,679 --> 00:29:24,720
ashamed of the shame but we shouldn't be

730
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:27,200
the shame is a natural result of shaming

731
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:29,080
I grew up in a media era when trans

732
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:31,279
women were usually presented as vomit

733
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:32,960
inducing monstrosities who deserve the

734
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:34,840
violence they bring upon themselves by

735
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,840
existing and I started my transition in

736
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:37,679
the first year of the Trump

737
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:39,559
Administration when there's been

738
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:41,640
constant vilification of trans people in

739
00:29:39,559 --> 00:29:43,760
the Press invading women's bathrooms

740
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:45,960
forcing our Insanity on children

741
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:47,880
destroying Western Civilization with our

742
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:50,720
authoritarian pronouns it's hard to

743
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:52,120
express just the daily humiliation of

744
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,320
being a transwoman under these

745
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:55,640
conditions and then there's the little

746
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:58,200
jobs people throw at you like my laser

747
00:29:55,640 --> 00:30:00,480
technician recently told me you must be

748
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:02,919
very courageous to transition because

749
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:04,679
that is not socially acceptable and then

750
00:30:02,919 --> 00:30:06,120
she went back to blasting laser beams

751
00:30:04,679 --> 00:30:08,679
into my [Â __Â ] and then there's the

752
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:10,399
internet where you know I used to spend

753
00:30:08,679 --> 00:30:11,960
most of my life before the sadness took

754
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:14,039
over and I'm sure we all know that

755
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:15,840
people on the internet are a wretched

756
00:30:14,039 --> 00:30:17,440
wretched horde of bigoted Attack

757
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:19,320
Helicopters the whole point of this

758
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:21,279
channel is I try to talk sense to these

759
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:23,200
people I talk to the turfs and the

760
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:24,600
conservatives and I try to empathize

761
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:26,760
with their point of view and provide a

762
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:28,840
rational response but a side effect of

763
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:30,880
all that research is I've acquired a

764
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:33,760
burgeoning vocabulary of self-loathing

765
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:36,039
it seeped into my brain and become a

766
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:38,799
part of me and this lifelong buildup of

767
00:30:36,039 --> 00:30:41,080
Shame has become a wound at the heart of

768
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:44,200
my existence and all I can really do

769
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:48,080
about it is compensate by wearing fancy

770
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:51,559
clothes I may be trash but I am Majestic

771
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:55,360
trash I am rendant trash I am coutur

772
00:30:51,559 --> 00:30:58,200
trash and I just bought a midcentury

773
00:30:55,360 --> 00:31:00,679
gold trimmed Venetian Bloom glass de

774
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:02,440
caner which helps me forget the shame

775
00:31:00,679 --> 00:31:04,720
and self-loathing that plagues my every

776
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:07,240
moment now I'm guessing that a lot of

777
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:09,639
people will be confused about why I'm so

778
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:11,519
ashamed of being gay when I've already

779
00:31:09,639 --> 00:31:13,240
come out as trans which seems like a

780
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:15,480
bigger deal to paraphrase what some

781
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:17,919
people have told me you're already a

782
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:19,760
transgendered and a freak's a freak so

783
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:22,279
who cares what kind of freak well first

784
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:25,039
of all I would like to propose a

785
00:31:22,279 --> 00:31:27,960
sociological Theory Tiffany's law all

786
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:29,840
freaks have a deep psychological need to

787
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:32,559
feel Superior to a different type of

788
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:34,120
freak and trans lesbians are pretty

789
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:35,880
close to the bottom of that packing

790
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:38,360
order who's even left for me to feel

791
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:41,840
superior to the goddamn belgians [Â __Â ]

792
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:43,480
this waffle second coming out as trans

793
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:45,919
wasn't as hard for me because I did it

794
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:47,919
incrementally over like 8 years at first

795
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:49,960
I was like well I'm just a man who wears

796
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:51,880
makeup sometimes then I was like

797
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:53,720
actually it's not just clothes and

798
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:55,440
makeup but I'm actually pretty genter

799
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:56,960
non-conforming in a lot of ways and then

800
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:59,159
I realized I'm not a man at all and I

801
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:01,840
identified as non binary then I started

802
00:31:59,159 --> 00:32:04,720
taking hormones in 2 months on HRT I

803
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:06,480
woke up one day and said it's fine I'm

804
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:08,720
literally a woman so by the time I

805
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:10,880
actually came out as a trans woman that

806
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:12,720
was actually a step up in terms of

807
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:14,679
social acceptability from where I was

808
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:16,240
before when I was a gender queer gender

809
00:32:14,679 --> 00:32:18,200
[Â __Â ] I felt like I didn't fit in

810
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:20,399
anywhere whereas when I started

811
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:22,440
transitioning to female even though at

812
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:25,679
first I had a lot of the same problems

813
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:27,399
there was at least a goal in mind some

814
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:29,880
possible future where I could lead a

815
00:32:27,399 --> 00:32:32,080
normal ish Life as a woman so the moment

816
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:34,159
I started identifying as a woman was the

817
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:35,720
moment The compet Voice entered my head

818
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:38,039
sure I've never been very attracted to

819
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:40,039
men before but maybe I'm attracted to

820
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:42,039
them now I'm a woman right I've always

821
00:32:40,039 --> 00:32:43,399
been a little by curious and there was

822
00:32:42,039 --> 00:32:45,760
that time I kissed a boy when I was

823
00:32:43,399 --> 00:32:47,919
drunk maybe I can make this work let's

824
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:49,919
choose some boys to be attracted to and

825
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:51,760
get started on this of course I wasn't

826
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:53,960
as self-aware as that my way of

827
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:55,919
explaining it to myself was I guess

828
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:57,480
hormones just magically changed my

829
00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:59,120
sexual orientation to the socially

830
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:02,639
acceptable one that's super freaking

831
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:04,279
crazy shut up you godamn lesbo God

832
00:33:02,639 --> 00:33:06,559
there's so much pressure on trans women

833
00:33:04,279 --> 00:33:08,840
to be extremely gender conforming and

834
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:10,480
even more so if you're a representative

835
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:12,600
of the community you feel like you have

836
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:14,519
to be a Stepford Wife or else CIS people

837
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:16,480
are going to throw us all in camps and

838
00:33:14,519 --> 00:33:18,799
early in my transition I kind of

839
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:20,679
worshiped straight trans women like I

840
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:22,960
looked up to them and I wanted to be

841
00:33:20,679 --> 00:33:25,440
just like them now back then there were

842
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:27,360
a handful of trans lesbians on YouTube

843
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:28,919
trying to make the case to the masses

844
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:32,039
that being a trans lesbian is a

845
00:33:28,919 --> 00:33:33,960
legitimate thing but in 2017 sweaty the

846
00:33:32,039 --> 00:33:36,279
masses were not having it I watched

847
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:38,279
those women get eaten alive and as a

848
00:33:36,279 --> 00:33:40,880
result of my witnessing that at a super

849
00:33:38,279 --> 00:33:43,679
[Â __Â ] vulnerable moment for me I

850
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:46,440
internalized the message that a trans

851
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:48,360
lesbian is just not an okay thing to be

852
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:49,960
if you want to be tolerated or respected

853
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:52,159
by anybody other than a handful of

854
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:54,399
Communists so I began my transition with

855
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:56,720
essentially no role model of a widely

856
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:58,840
respected and admired trans lesbian and

857
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:01,240
it doesn't help that most forms of

858
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:02,639
transphobia are harsher on gay trans

859
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:04,159
women than they are on straight trans

860
00:34:02,639 --> 00:34:06,480
women like could take this Trope that

861
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:08,760
trans women are men who transition to

862
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:10,800
creep on women in bathrooms in response

863
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:13,119
to that it feels really good to be able

864
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:15,320
to say I'm not even attracted to women

865
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:17,679
I'm just a petite heterosexual bio girl

866
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:22,280
I'm surely not some kind of six-foot

867
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:23,599
monster who likes women shame shame it

868
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:25,480
does make me feel like a monster

869
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:27,760
sometimes like a mutant that has no

870
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:29,440
place in society and this shame has

871
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:31,800
actually made it more difficult for me

872
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:33,320
to accept that I'm a gay woman than it

873
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:35,159
was for me to come out as Trans in the

874
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:37,599
first place it's like I made a kind of

875
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:39,159
subconscious bargain where I traded my

876
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:41,599
sexual orientation for my gender

877
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:43,200
identity so I finally transitioned only

878
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:45,240
to spend the next couple years living

879
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:48,359
with a different kind of denial and that

880
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:50,320
denial got pretty deep and pretty dark

881
00:34:48,359 --> 00:34:53,040
this is painful and incriminating to

882
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:55,200
admit but not all of my shame came from

883
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:57,960
external bigotry some of it came from my

884
00:34:55,200 --> 00:35:00,680
own judgment and disgust toward things I

885
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:03,320
saw trans lesbians doing like this anime

886
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:05,079
Catgirl [Â __Â ] which clearly gets under my

887
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:07,040
skin and not just because these people

888
00:35:05,079 --> 00:35:08,800
have been harassing me for 3 years like

889
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:11,839
you see it all over trans Twitter in

890
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:14,320
Reddit this queasy combination of the

891
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:17,160
hypersexual and the infantile I'm a

892
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:19,880
hecking Catgirl lesbian klut Meow Meow

893
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:22,359
Girl dick here's the 97th picture of my

894
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:25,320
own legs and thigh high stripy socks

895
00:35:22,359 --> 00:35:27,440
oooo what is that about is this how

896
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:28,280
women act sis people are going to see

897
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,599
this

898
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:32,880
they're not going to let us into women's

899
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:34,400
spaces if we act like that now I'm not

900
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:36,720
proud of having these judgmental

901
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:40,240
feelings but I confess to periodically

902
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:42,359
sinking into these morbid guilty binges

903
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:44,160
of cringing at embarrassing trans

904
00:35:42,359 --> 00:35:46,000
lesbians and if I was a different type

905
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:48,480
of YouTuber I could have turned this

906
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,680
into content at my worst I would sit

907
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:53,480
there telling another trans person why

908
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:55,520
are trans lesbians so cringey they're

909
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:58,040
making things harder for the rest of us

910
00:35:55,520 --> 00:36:00,800
girls and that's the real darkness isn't

911
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:03,200
it not even having the decency to openly

912
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:05,599
despise yourself like an honest American

913
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:08,000
no just sitting there in absurd denial

914
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:10,200
of who you are as a person disparaging

915
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,880
your own repressed identity to anyone

916
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:14,680
who will listen and I'm ashamed of that

917
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:17,359
too I'm ashamed I sunk that low but all

918
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:19,319
you can do is try to get better and I'm

919
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:21,680
trying to get better I've broken free of

920
00:36:19,319 --> 00:36:24,880
the denial and now I have to break free

921
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:27,000
of the shame because shame is literally

922
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:29,319
ruining my life I told Joanne I was

923
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:31,680
working on a video about shame and she

924
00:36:29,319 --> 00:36:33,440
said I might want to mention that one of

925
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:36,560
the reasons she didn't want to be with

926
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:39,000
me is she'd be ashamed to date another

927
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:41,240
transwoman she said she feels like

928
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:43,319
relationships between trans women are

929
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:45,839
freakish behavior on the outskirts of

930
00:36:43,319 --> 00:36:47,839
society with no attempt to integrate

931
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:51,160
these are very painful words to hear

932
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:52,839
from the woman you're in love with but I

933
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:54,720
understand why she feels that way Joanne

934
00:36:52,839 --> 00:36:58,079
gets validation from dating CIS men or

935
00:36:54,720 --> 00:37:00,119
CIS women but I can't be the h

936
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:01,720
that connects her to mainstream society

937
00:37:00,119 --> 00:37:04,079
and it's maddening to me that she feels

938
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:06,640
that way because I would have chosen her

939
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:08,119
over every CIS woman in the world but

940
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:10,800
I'm just another worthless freak without

941
00:37:08,119 --> 00:37:14,280
the authority of society behind me so my

942
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:16,480
love doesn't count shame it poisons the

943
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:19,119
soul you know who you love just like

944
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:22,160
what gender you are is such a basic part

945
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:24,359
of your humanity and shame about that

946
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:26,880
cuts to the core of your being it's not

947
00:37:24,359 --> 00:37:29,599
I'm ashamed of what I did it's not I'm

948
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:32,760
ashamed of how I I feel it's I'm ashamed

949
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:36,400
of who and what I am and living in that

950
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:38,680
state of mind is is garbage it's it's

951
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:41,000
basically hell even after I realized my

952
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:43,800
sexuality I considered just shoving that

953
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:46,040
[Â __Â ] back down never coming out I have

954
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:47,319
all these fears about it I'm worried

955
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:49,319
people will take my gender less

956
00:37:47,319 --> 00:37:50,760
seriously I'm worried CIS women or

957
00:37:49,319 --> 00:37:52,839
straight women I'm friends with will get

958
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:54,920
weird about it I'm worried I'll die a

959
00:37:52,839 --> 00:37:56,599
lonely useless lesbian in which case I

960
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:57,960
should have just married a man cuz at

961
00:37:56,599 --> 00:37:59,880
least then there'd be some to kill the

962
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:01,200
spiders and fix the [Â __Â ] sink I'm

963
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:03,920
worried I'll lose my straight male

964
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:05,960
audience on YouTube although I mean love

965
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:07,359
you boys and please keep the attention

966
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:09,800
coming cuz I need all the validation I

967
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:12,160
can get right now but I will be fine

968
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:13,920
without you and in any case when is a

969
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:16,200
woman's being a lesbian ever stopped a

970
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:18,960
man from taking a swing at it I actually

971
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:21,160
thought about marrying a man anyway just

972
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:24,319
sacrificing my sexual orientation to

973
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:26,079
regain that safe comfortable Shameless

974
00:38:24,319 --> 00:38:28,160
feeling I used to have when walking down

975
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:30,359
the street holding Chad's hand hand

976
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:32,040
feeling like I'd succeeded as a woman

977
00:38:30,359 --> 00:38:34,319
but if I don't deal with this now and

978
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:35,760
work towards accepting myself then I'm

979
00:38:34,319 --> 00:38:38,079
just going to be in the same situation

980
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:39,839
in 10 years when I'm 41 years old and

981
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:41,880
married to a man and having these same

982
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:43,560
feelings so it's time for this to stop

983
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:46,200
because literally the only good thing

984
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:48,400
about being gay is doing gay [Â __Â ] and as

985
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:49,760
long as I'm ashamed of my sexuality no

986
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:52,200
one's going to want to do gay [Â __Â ] with

987
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:53,880
me as I like to say if you can't love

988
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:55,839
yourself how in the hell you going to

989
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:57,599
prop up your narcissistic delusions look

990
00:38:55,839 --> 00:38:59,440
I'm trying to stay positive Maybe maybe

991
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:01,599
everyone hates trans lesbians now but

992
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:04,520
just you wait we all know how Trends

993
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:07,319
work in 10 years being a trans lesbian

994
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:09,160
will be the coolest hippest chicest

995
00:39:07,319 --> 00:39:11,200
thing imaginable and all the people who

996
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:13,400
talk [Â __Â ] now will forget they ever said

997
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:14,760
a word that's right even the straight

998
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:17,240
trans girls will be making out with each

999
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:20,880

00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:32,000
CIS lesbians oh it will actually be a

1004
00:39:28,599 --> 00:39:34,720
sign of prestige to have a trap
