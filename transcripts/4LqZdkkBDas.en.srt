my Lords ladies and there's that life

00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:09,690
betwixt tis evident

3
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:11,969
no sensation nor the passions possessed

4
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:15,179
Dominion never the mind of man which is

5
00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:23,010
ruled instead by a reason sovereign of

6
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:24,470
all faculties it must needs be remarked

7
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:27,359
that the power of the Commonwealth

8
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:30,000
derive it not from the despotic 'el

9
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:32,610
acquisitions of conquerors but from that

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:38,160
covenant amongst men whereby they most

11
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:41,910
resembling the lobster farmington are we

12
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:43,969
doing this again lady tottington i'm so

13
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:46,800
happy to finally meet the real year

00:00:43,969 --> 00:00:48,690
Malti I'm not gonna kiss your hand you

15
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,430
freak I'm more of a woman than you are

16
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:53,399
it's not what they was saying at the

17
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:55,140
Parisian Selim clock Me Amadeus don't

18
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:56,730
break the fourth wall I'm trying to make

19
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:58,920
a video about post-modernism

20
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:01,020
get out of my drawing-room 18th century

21
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:11,640
sexual deviance so much for the tolerant

22
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:13,860
jacobins reason power truth these are

23
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:16,170
the kinds of topics that I simply don't

24
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:18,150
care about unfortunately we have to talk

25
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:24,720
about them because of a guy named Jordan

26
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:26,430
Peterson - who's Jordan Peterson Wow

27
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,799
he's a psychology professor at the

28
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:30,720
University of Toronto who got famous for

29
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,640
sounding the alarm about how protecting

30
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,320
transgender people under Canadian human

31
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,509
rights law shall surely lead to

32
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,579
Stalinism since then he's been touring

33
00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:39,840
North America as a celebrity lecturer

34
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:41,759
david brooks called him the most

35
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,920
influential public intellectual in the

36
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,600
western world at his self-help book 12

37
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,579
rules for life as a national and

38
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,229
international bestseller i'm starting to

39
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:51,180
think we may need to take this guy

40
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:53,159
seriously he's got a lot of fans on

41
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:55,920
youtube and i hope you guys are here

42
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:57,630
because i want to talk a lot of leftists

43
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,610
who have responded to peterson haven't

44
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:02,219
really engaged with his ideas very much

45
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:04,530
he's often caricatured avoided or talked

46
00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:06,719
past as in the infamous BBC interview

47
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:08,759
where Kathy Newman keeps repeating back

48
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:10,560
very uncharitable interpretations of

49
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:12,209
everything he says so you were saying

50
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,440
that by and large women are too

51
00:02:12,209 --> 00:02:15,360
agreeable to get the pay

52
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,010
I see so I'm saying that that's one

53
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,840
component you're saying that women

54
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:21,180
aren't intelligent enough to run these

55
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:23,160
taka no you just say murderers so to

56
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:24,660
provoke on you I mean you are provocate

57
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:26,280
I never say lightly they aren't right

58
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:28,260
that you hate to be compared to you're

59
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:30,570
saying that we should organize our

60
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:31,920
societies along the lines of the

61
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:33,840
lobsters I think that people watching

62
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,600
this it comes off as if leftists are

63
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,520
like afraid of his actual ideas but I'm

64
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:40,350
not afraid of his ideas I'm not afraid

65
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:48,570
of anything I just smoked a bunch of

66
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:50,550
[ __ ] PCP daddy so I spent the last

67
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:52,710
couple weeks listening to hours of

68
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:55,770
Peterson's lectures and podcasts and

69
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:57,240
reading his books and honestly I think I

70
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:59,190
get why people like him

71
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:01,590
clearly he has real talent as a public

72
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:03,960
speaker and as a kind of life coach his

73
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:05,880
book 12 rules for life echoes past

74
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:07,470
bestsellers like Stephen Covey's the

75
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:09,720
seven Habits of Highly Effective People

76
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:11,820
or Rick Warren's The Purpose Driven Life

77
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:14,130
the difference is that Peterson takes

78
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:16,500
basic self-help insights like take

79
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:18,930
responsibility for yourself don't envy

80
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:20,730
other people and he renews them with the

81
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:23,400
intellectual trappings of psychology

82
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:25,530
philosophy yogi and psychoanalysis and

83
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:27,450
Bible readings he's telling us a pretty

84
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:29,430
classic story life is suffering

85
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:31,110
happiness is not enough to sustain you

86
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:32,910
through suffering so you need a higher

87
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:35,459
purpose in your life but I knew that

88
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:37,410
already I learned it at the AAA meetings

89
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:39,150
I refused to go to these are like basic

90
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:41,160
insights of world philosophy and

91
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:43,470
religion but their insights that today's

92
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:45,660
youth apparently haven't heard before

93
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:47,489
I guess because not enough of them are

94
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:48,900
alcoholics or at any rate they haven't

95
00:03:47,489 --> 00:03:50,940
heard them in a vocabulary that

96
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:53,459
connected with so do a lot of people

97
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:55,170
Peterson's ideas seem new and urgent and

98
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:57,120
I don't really object to any of the

99
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:59,580
self-help stuff loose of Peterson's fans

100
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,650
are young men and I mean someone has to

101
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:04,410
live the neckbeards into shape and if

102
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:06,570
Pearson can do that more power to them I

103
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:09,160
mean sometimes boys just need a daddy

104
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:12,140
and sometimes girls do too

105
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:14,270
but there's a big problem here and the

106
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:16,489
problem is that all this life coaching

107
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:18,560
is basically just a Trojan horse for a

108
00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:20,720
reactionary political agenda Peterson

109
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:23,000
advocates and ethics of self-help not

110
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,920
merely as a guide to private life but as

111
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,230
a replacement for progressive politics

112
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:29,930
which he characterizes as totalitarian

113
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:33,590
and evil there's no comparison there now

114
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:35,930
and a trans activist is there why not

115
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:38,419
the philosophy that's guiding their

116
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:39,470
utterances is the same philosophy now

117
00:04:38,419 --> 00:04:41,270
Peterson doesn't use the word

118
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:43,160
progressive politics because that

119
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:49,340
doesn't sound scary enough his new

120
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:51,530
scarier word is post now we have to be

121
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:54,710
careful not to confuse postmodern neo

122
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:56,360
Marxism with cultural Marxism the Nazi

123
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:57,950
conspiracy theory about Marxist

124
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:00,200
intellectuals plotting to destroy the

125
00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:01,910
West surely this is not the same thing

126
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:04,610
as that right right

127
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:06,620
so look I genuinely do not think Jordan

128
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:08,870
Peterson is a fascist and you may quote

129
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:10,790
me on that but I am wondering if it's

130
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:12,530
not a fascist conspiracy theory about

131
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:15,500
Marxist intellectuals plotting to

132
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:18,620
destroy the West then what is postmodern

133
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:20,780
neo Marxism well JP that's what I'd like

134
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:24,770
to talk about so Jordan sorry dr.

135
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:26,750
Peterson professor daddy let's talk and

136
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:28,669
for once I'd like to actually treat this

137
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:32,320
discussion with the seriousness and

138
00:05:28,669 --> 00:05:32,320
respect I think it deserves

139
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:40,150
[Music]

140
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:43,340
[Applause]

141
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:49,400
okay good temperature tell me the oil

142
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:50,810
would you daddy thanks daddy it's really

143
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:55,340
an honor to bathe with a public

144
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:57,080
intellectual of your stature you know I

145
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:58,640
never like to argue in the bath so I

146
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:00,380
want to start by telling you the things

147
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:02,360
I like about you the first thing is that

148
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:04,550
I think some of your criticisms of the

149
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:06,830
left the stifling of even slightly

150
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:08,870
different opinions the gratuitous

151
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:11,990
loathing of Western cultural monuments

152
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:13,900
the politics and resentment are within a

153
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:16,370
certain media or corner of academia

154
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:18,350
valid complaints I even made a video

155
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:20,420
about that a long time ago when I was a

156
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:22,850
different person oh god the dysphoria

157
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:24,350
please don't watch it but my worry is

158
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:25,970
that you're leaving an international

159
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:28,640
political backlash against what is a

160
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:30,050
very localized problem and I worry that

161
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:32,570
some of our society's most vulnerable

162
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:34,580
people could be hurt by that backlash

163
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:36,020
like fine you hate postmodern

164
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:38,390
intellectuals an overly sensitive

165
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:41,420
student activists but if your backlash

166
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:43,940
also targets gender equality LGBT

167
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:48,590
acceptance and civil rights that would

168
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:50,540
be bad right I also like that you tell

169
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:52,490
people how to live their lives I mean I

170
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:53,090
personally hate taking orders outside of

171
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:56,720
the bedroom

172
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:58,250
but clearly the sheep need a shepherd

173
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,050
and you've really stepped up with these

174
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:01,910
12 rules you know on the Left we don't

175
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:03,710
really tell people what to do we tell

176
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:06,380
them what not to do don't exploit the

177
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:07,730
workers do not do blackface I guess we

178
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:09,800
tell people what pronouns to use for

179
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:11,750
trans people but that's a pretty small

180
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:14,889
rule compared to some of your rules like

181
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:18,699
how to raise your children or what

182
00:07:14,889 --> 00:07:20,919
okay to criticize things the last thing

183
00:07:18,699 --> 00:07:22,990
I like is you talk about deep [ __ ] I was

184
00:07:20,919 --> 00:07:25,330
watching a video where you and a couple

185
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:27,729
of zany goons we're talking about Plato

186
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:30,639
and Aristotle the meaning of life and I

187
00:07:27,729 --> 00:07:32,620
thought huh on the Left we don't really

188
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:34,360
talk about that kind of thing all we

189
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:36,009
talk about is how society oppresses

190
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:38,229
people and that might not be enough

191
00:07:36,009 --> 00:07:40,330
because people need to have a positive

192
00:07:38,229 --> 00:07:42,580
purpose in life I mean personally I

193
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:43,930
don't give a [ __ ] I'm pretty happy to

194
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:45,819
say here are watching the same three

195
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:48,580
seasons of strangers with candy until I

196
00:07:45,819 --> 00:07:50,830
die but other people like Dostoevsky

197
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:53,919
come you other white guys who talk about

198
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:56,050
lobsters they have this need to have

199
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:58,810
purpose in the face of suffering and

200
00:07:56,050 --> 00:08:00,250
like not just complain about patriarchy

201
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:02,349
I guess is easier to not complain about

202
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:03,879
patriarchy when patriarchy isn't the

203
00:08:02,349 --> 00:08:05,740
thing that's making you suffer but I do

204
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:07,360
think that an education that only

205
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:09,219
teaches people about oppression is

206
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,710
inadequate we spend four years teaching

207
00:08:09,219 --> 00:08:13,990
undergraduates why capitalism is bad and

208
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:16,659
then we say well you're educated now

209
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:19,659
good luck getting a job under capitalism

210
00:08:16,659 --> 00:08:21,819
by and that really kind of sucks but you

211
00:08:19,659 --> 00:08:23,949
know I think that's a point that could

212
00:08:21,819 --> 00:08:28,330
probably be made without comparing

213
00:08:23,949 --> 00:08:29,500
transgender activism to Stalin if you

214
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:30,969
like this came across a little more

215
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:32,440
sarcastic than I intended

216
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:34,360
see this is what you've got to use a

217
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:36,459
firmer hand with me Peterson if you

218
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:39,279
don't establish dominance I'm just gonna

219
00:08:36,459 --> 00:08:41,409
melt off they use all this to passion

220
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:44,079
language and I'm on the side of the

221
00:08:41,409 --> 00:08:46,420
oppressed all of that posturing it does

222
00:08:44,079 --> 00:08:48,430
nothing but mask the underlying drive to

223
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:50,350
power and I've just been starting to

224
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:52,329
review their curriculum for children

225
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:55,660
from kindergarten to grade eight it's

226
00:08:52,329 --> 00:08:57,990
pure social justice post-modernism the

227
00:08:55,660 --> 00:09:01,149
people who hold this doctrine just

228
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:03,490
radical postmodern communitarian option

229
00:09:01,149 --> 00:09:05,500
the mixed racial identity or sexual

230
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:07,980
identity or gender identity or some kind

231
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:12,030
of group identity terminal

232
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:14,950
control the most long to mid-level

233
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:16,840
bureaucratic structures and many

234
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:17,710
governments as well but even in the

235
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:34,710
United States

236
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:34,710
[Music]

237
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:45,880
[Music]

238
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:52,930
so you gotta give it to JP when he says

239
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:54,579
stand up straight with your shoulders

240
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:56,529
back he means that

241
00:09:54,579 --> 00:09:58,750
so Jordan Peterson has succeeded largely

242
00:09:56,529 --> 00:10:01,000
by drawing in audiences with fairly

243
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:03,550
popular opinions political correctness

244
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,870
often feels stifling student activists

245
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:05,620
are sometimes in articulate and

246
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:07,720
over-reactive

247
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:09,790
angry transsexuals are telling me what

248
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:11,649
words to use and I don't like it but

249
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:13,930
once he draws you in with these inviting

250
00:10:11,649 --> 00:10:16,269
preludes he leads you to a pretty weird

251
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:18,040
place his central political message is

252
00:10:16,269 --> 00:10:20,500
that leftist professors student

253
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:22,779
activists campus diversity initiatives

254
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:24,700
and corporate HR departments are

255
00:10:22,779 --> 00:10:27,070
collectively following the philosophy of

256
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:29,410
postmodern neo Marxism to destroy

257
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:31,930
Western civilization and sink us all

258
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:33,760
into a totalitarian nightmare now

259
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:35,740
there's just no avoiding that this idea

260
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:38,019
is actually pretty similar to the

261
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:40,390
cultural Marxism or cultural Bolshevism

262
00:10:38,019 --> 00:10:42,430
theory but I'm just gonna ignore that

263
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:44,380
because if I do well on it will sound

264
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:46,750
like I'm saying Peterson is a fascist

265
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:49,660
and then everyone will think I'm crazy

266
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:52,269
look I'm not afraid of psychologists I

267
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:54,240
don't like to hide so let's just try not

268
00:10:52,269 --> 00:10:56,769
to think about that and instead

269
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:59,170
straightforwardly ask is it true that

270
00:10:56,769 --> 00:11:01,180
postmodern neo Marxism is out to destroy

271
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:03,519
us all well why don't we analyze the

272
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:05,529
concept of postmodern and Marxism we all

273
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:07,209
know what Marxism is the idea that

274
00:11:05,529 --> 00:11:09,160
society should be understood as a class

275
00:11:07,209 --> 00:11:10,720
struggle between workers and capitalists

276
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:12,279
and that the workers will eventually

277
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,230
revolt some college professors

278
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:16,149
definitely do believe that but zero

279
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:20,680
percent of corporate HR departments do

280
00:11:16,149 --> 00:11:22,930
so that okay so what is post-modernism

281
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:24,640
well it's the vaguest word in the

282
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:26,140
English language some people try to

283
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,000
explain it by listing all the things

284
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:30,070
that are called postmodern and then

285
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,510
trying to guess what they have in common

286
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:33,250
that's basically what the YouTuber

287
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:35,589
armored skeptic did in his video about

288
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:37,240
it so many daddies in this video we did

289
00:11:35,589 --> 00:11:39,459
invite the model of barbecue complain

290
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:41,920
about post-modernism listen to some

291
00:11:39,459 --> 00:11:43,360
Zeppelin I've had worse evenings I don't

292
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,070
think there really is a common thread

293
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,750
linking all the things called postmodern

294
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:48,730
basically post-modernism is everything

295
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:50,019
that happened after 1945 that seemed you

296
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:51,940
knew at the time but when Jordan

297
00:11:50,019 --> 00:11:54,010
Peterson says post-modernism he's not

298
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:56,260
talking about Andy Warhol or Quentin

299
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:59,620
Tarantino he's talking about postmodern

300
00:11:56,260 --> 00:12:00,600
philosophy so what's that well basically

301
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:03,360
it's a

302
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:05,819
scepticism not YouTube skepticism but

303
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,709
actual skepticism you know like having

304
00:12:05,819 --> 00:12:09,089
doubts about whether humans can really

305
00:12:07,709 --> 00:12:11,040
know things about the world how

306
00:12:09,089 --> 00:12:14,399
skepticism is obviously not a new idea

307
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:16,470
that goes way back to ancient times but

308
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:18,810
more specifically post-modernism is

309
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:21,149
skepticism about modernism

310
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:23,130
so what's modernism what's what what are

311
00:12:21,149 --> 00:12:24,930
words what's anything I'm gonna divide

312
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:26,579
modernism into two periods because I

313
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:28,500
feel like it first there's early

314
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:30,089
modernism early modernism is the

315
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:32,100
philosophy developed by a bunch of

316
00:12:30,089 --> 00:12:33,990
boring eighteenth-century Queens which

317
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:35,759
says that we can form Universal theories

318
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:38,430
about the world through observation and

319
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:40,199
reasoning aka the scientific method now

320
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:42,360
that turns out to work pretty well for

321
00:12:40,199 --> 00:12:44,220
whatever questions you have about plants

322
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:46,769
and crystals and how to medically

323
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:48,509
reconfigure human genitals but it has

324
00:12:46,769 --> 00:12:51,149
some limits which was pointed out by

325
00:12:48,509 --> 00:12:52,800
David Hume one of the least boring 18th

326
00:12:51,149 --> 00:12:54,870
century Queens and one of the only

327
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,579
philosophers I can actually put up with

328
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:59,490
in small doses even though he was a

329
00:12:56,579 --> 00:13:01,529
[ __ ] racist and also Scottish this is

330
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:03,630
a call out Hume argued that from Asher

331
00:13:01,529 --> 00:13:05,430
to the empirical perspective you can't

332
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:07,829
really know much about important things

333
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:09,930
like morality causation and the self

334
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:11,759
because those aren't the kinds of things

335
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:13,769
you can observe anyway then the late

336
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:15,750
modernists came along and they said [ __ ]

337
00:13:13,769 --> 00:13:17,699
him we're gonna do science about those

338
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:18,509
things anyway so the late modernists

339
00:13:17,699 --> 00:13:20,490
were a bunch of boring

340
00:13:18,509 --> 00:13:22,860
nineteenth-century neckbeards who one

341
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:25,110
way or another try to discover universal

342
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:27,449
scientific truths about humans so for

343
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:29,399
example you have psychoanalysis which

344
00:13:27,449 --> 00:13:31,860
said human nature can be understood in

345
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:33,959
terms of unconscious tribes which is of

346
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:36,480
course ridiculous I'm conscious of all

347
00:13:33,959 --> 00:13:38,519
my drives and you got Marxism with its

348
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,350
analysis of boot huazi and proletariat

349
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:42,360
you got early sociology and anthropology

350
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:44,819
which started out with recent social

351
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:47,279
evolutionism and progresses to a kind of

352
00:13:44,819 --> 00:13:48,689
we're all the same universalism Jordan

353
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:51,000
Peterson is right at home with the lay

354
00:13:48,689 --> 00:13:53,040
modernists his first book maps of

355
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,720
meaning is an attempt to describe how

356
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,610
humans make sense of the world and

357
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,920
create order out of chaos through

358
00:13:56,610 --> 00:14:00,360
universal myths and archetypes which he

359
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:02,009
claims are a product of our species

360
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:04,380
evolutionary past

361
00:14:02,009 --> 00:14:06,149
boy this is a lot of explaining it's so

362
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:07,889
much explaining it's triggering gender

363
00:14:06,149 --> 00:14:10,050
dysphoria I better put on some longer

364
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:14,029
nails nails

365
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:14,029
it's an old woman who'd means to you

366
00:14:14,149 --> 00:14:18,330
haha post-modernism is skepticism about

367
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:20,010
modernism

368
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:21,839
so whereas modernists try to create

369
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:24,269
eternal and universal theories about a

370
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:26,820
reality history and humanity post

371
00:14:24,269 --> 00:14:27,450
modernists say actually no that's not

372
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:29,790
possible

373
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:33,620
for example the French post modernist

374
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:36,089
Michele fuku Sargon little Guth's

375
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:38,160
Michele fuku wrote intellectual

376
00:14:36,089 --> 00:14:40,140
histories of subjects like psychiatry

377
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:42,000
medicine and criminal justice in which

378
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:43,500
he argued that we should not understand

379
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,940
these histories and straightforward

380
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:47,430
progressions toward liberty and

381
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:49,740
scientific truth but rather as mere

382
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:52,140
shifts in the way that power orders our

383
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:53,730
institutions and populations the other

384
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:55,500
post modernist I've actually read a lot

385
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:57,209
of his Richard Rorty yeah [ __ ] you

386
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:58,769
Derrida if you wanted me to read you you

387
00:14:57,209 --> 00:15:00,300
should have been easier to read Rorty

388
00:14:58,769 --> 00:15:02,700
advocates an attitude toward knowledge

389
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:04,470
he calls ayran ism irony being the

390
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:06,209
sceptical caution with which we should

391
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:08,820
regard our own beliefs in our awareness

392
00:15:06,209 --> 00:15:11,190
that our vocabulary for describing and

393
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:13,140
understanding the world is not the final

394
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:15,029
or best vocabulary all right that's

395
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:17,250
enough explaining and my nails are done

396
00:15:15,029 --> 00:15:19,529
check it out do you enjoy having long

397
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:21,329
glamorous nails with the lesbians and

398
00:15:19,529 --> 00:15:23,850
queer girls keep flaring up them with

399
00:15:21,329 --> 00:15:25,920
barely concealed visceral rage well I

400
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:28,470
have a solution for you the bisexual

401
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:31,260
manicure one end for the V one end for

402
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:33,690
the D both for degeneracy it's

403
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:35,760
absolutely filthy so we've got all the

404
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:37,440
pieces on the table now you've just got

405
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:39,899
up with a puzzle together on the one

406
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:42,060
hand we have Marxism a fundamentally

407
00:15:39,899 --> 00:15:44,370
modernist worldview that theorizes the

408
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:46,529
human condition in economic terms on the

409
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:48,390
other hand we have post-modernism the

410
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:50,339
sceptical worldview that denies our

411
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:52,680
capacity to know any universal truths

412
00:15:50,339 --> 00:15:54,149
about anything on the face of it it was

413
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:56,100
seeing these two ideas are not

414
00:15:54,149 --> 00:15:58,290
compatible and there is an extensive

415
00:15:56,100 --> 00:16:00,360
history of dispute between them with for

416
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:02,670
instance the Marxist Sartre calling

417
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:04,860
Foucault the last barricade the Fugazi

418
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:06,589
can erect against Marx and of course as

419
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:08,780
we all know when Foucault died

420
00:16:06,589 --> 00:16:12,770
capitalism did and forever

421
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:14,630
[Music]

422
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:17,089
so where does Peterson get off talking

423
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:18,649
about postmodern neo Marxism well it's

424
00:16:17,089 --> 00:16:20,690
true that a lot of post modernists were

425
00:16:18,649 --> 00:16:22,490
in some way influenced by Marxism

426
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:24,500
so the phrase could just refer to that

427
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:26,390
continuity but that's not what Peterson

428
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:28,339
means it's clear for the way he uses the

429
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:29,870
term the concept is even more jumbled

430
00:16:28,339 --> 00:16:31,640
and nonsensical than it initially

431
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:33,980
appears Peterson uses the term

432
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:35,779
postmodern neo Marxism to include not

433
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:37,850
only postmodern intellectuals and

434
00:16:35,779 --> 00:16:40,310
Marxist intellectuals but also liberal

435
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:42,170
politicians academic administrators in

436
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:44,240
corporate HR departments that care about

437
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:46,880
diversity and so-called identity

438
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:49,100
politics activists including feminists

439
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:51,230
LGBTQ and civil rights activists

440
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:52,880
basically is the entirety of the modern

441
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:54,560
left now I've already mentioned how

442
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:57,050
Marxism and post-modernism more

443
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:58,970
fundamentally at odds since Marxism is a

444
00:16:57,050 --> 00:17:00,560
big story about a struggle between two

445
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:03,440
clear and distinct groups and

446
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:05,179
post-modernism is skepticism about big

447
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:07,280
stories like this and about the

448
00:17:05,179 --> 00:17:08,839
stability of binaries like booj Rossi

449
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:11,329
and proletarian but that's not the only

450
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:13,790
tension and Peterson's [ __ ] idea

451
00:17:11,329 --> 00:17:15,949
of postmodern neo Marxism anyone with

452
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:18,079
any experience and leftist circles knows

453
00:17:15,949 --> 00:17:19,939
that Marxists and identity politics

454
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:22,100
activists are constantly at each other's

455
00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:24,020
throats because the Marxists accused the

456
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:26,329
activists of being blue jaw dogs who

457
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:28,520
want more female CEOs of color and more

458
00:17:26,329 --> 00:17:30,710
disabled transgendered drunk pilots

459
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:32,690
while the activists accuse the Marxists

460
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:34,700
of being a boys club of brochure lists

461
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:36,470
no more work on gender and race issues

462
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:38,720
than the average Jordan Peterson found

463
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:41,000
most often these accusations are correct

464
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,770
because everyone is problematic and I

465
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,540
disown them all and then there's also

466
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:46,040
the conflict between the identity

467
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:47,960
politics activists and the post

468
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:50,300
modernists why does everyone think that

469
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:52,340
identity politics is postmodern there's

470
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:54,620
nothing postmodern about it identity

471
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:56,990
politics advocates for rights equality

472
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:59,090
and justice for particular groups such

473
00:17:56,990 --> 00:18:01,390
as women people of color and gay and

474
00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:03,650
trans people this kind of activism

475
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:05,809
presupposes that these group categories

476
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:08,090
exists and are a useful basis for

477
00:18:05,809 --> 00:18:10,220
political organizing post modernists do

478
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:12,620
kind of the opposite they want to show

479
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:14,870
that these categories race gender sexual

480
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:17,360
orientation or contingent social

481
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:19,280
constructs and/or themselves potentially

482
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:21,919
oppressive this is why conventional

483
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:23,809
feminist activists often hate postmodern

484
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:24,710
feminism because the postmodern feminist

485
00:18:23,809 --> 00:18:26,539
Swan

486
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:28,820
the whole concept of womanhood for

487
00:18:26,539 --> 00:18:30,440
instance is contingent and potentially

488
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:32,779
oppressive and they think we should be

489
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:34,519
working to destabilize and under - and

490
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:36,830
then the conventional feminist activists

491
00:18:34,519 --> 00:18:38,509
say the [ __ ] we need the concept of

492
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:40,399
womanhood to organize around women's

493
00:18:38,509 --> 00:18:41,990
political interests how are we supposed

494
00:18:40,399 --> 00:18:43,970
to do that if we undermine and

495
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:46,070
destabilize the concept of womanhood and

496
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:48,230
in turn the postmodern feminists say

497
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:50,360
well here's a quotation from Judith

498
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:52,070
Butler the most famous postmodern

499
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:54,080
feminist ever is it not a sign of

500
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:56,509
despair over public politics when

501
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:58,100
identity becomes its own policy bringing

502
00:18:56,509 --> 00:19:00,499
with it those who would police it from

503
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:02,749
various sides and this is not a call to

504
00:19:00,499 --> 00:19:04,970
return to silence or invisibility but

505
00:19:02,749 --> 00:19:06,950
rather to make use of a category that

506
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:09,559
can be called into question made to

507
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:10,820
account for what it excludes if you take

508
00:19:09,559 --> 00:19:12,740
the first part of that quote out of

509
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:14,360
context it almost sounds like something

510
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:16,519
Jordan Peterson could have said the

511
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:18,230
difference is that JP actually does

512
00:19:16,519 --> 00:19:20,869
think we should return to silence and

513
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:22,940
invisibility or does he it's hard to

514
00:19:20,869 --> 00:19:25,129
tell what he thinks more on that in a

515
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:27,740
moment I bring all this up to show that

516
00:19:25,129 --> 00:19:29,690
one the idea of postmodern neo-marxist

517
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:32,679
identity politics as a unifying concept

518
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:35,779
of the left is nonsensical and to

519
00:19:32,679 --> 00:19:37,429
identity politics is not this dogma that

520
00:19:35,779 --> 00:19:39,409
must go unquestioned there were

521
00:19:37,429 --> 00:19:41,749
sophisticated debates about this going

522
00:19:39,409 --> 00:19:43,639
on within leftist academia but Jordan

523
00:19:41,749 --> 00:19:46,190
Peterson either doesn't know that or

524
00:19:43,639 --> 00:19:48,350
doesn't care he uses the term postmodern

525
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:50,509
neo Marxism to characterize the left of

526
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:53,210
the unified philosophical force bent on

527
00:19:50,509 --> 00:19:55,009
destroying Western civilization when in

528
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:56,570
fact it's a bunch of bumbling buffoons

529
00:19:55,009 --> 00:19:58,340
who can't stop squabbling with each

530
00:19:56,570 --> 00:20:00,590
other over every goddamn little issue

531
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:02,090
the only reason I can think of that the

532
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:04,610
left would appear to be a unified

533
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:06,679
philosophical force is if you're so far

534
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:08,059
to the right that literally everyone who

535
00:20:06,679 --> 00:20:10,039
supports the economic and social

536
00:20:08,059 --> 00:20:12,710
advancement of disadvantaged groups

537
00:20:10,039 --> 00:20:14,570
looks like one homogeneous enemy but is

538
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:16,759
that what Doron Peterson is saying that

539
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:19,249
he opposes all social progress for women

540
00:20:16,759 --> 00:20:21,409
racial and sexual minorities well it's

541
00:20:19,249 --> 00:20:23,690
difficult to say because while he spends

542
00:20:21,409 --> 00:20:25,580
much of his time comparing activists for

543
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:28,070
these movements to 20th century mass

544
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:30,440
murderers he resists being pinned down

545
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:32,160
to any more specific position I was

546
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:33,900
maybe too harsh on Cathy knew

547
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:35,640
earlier she came out of the interview

548
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,090
looking bad but she had a tough job to

549
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:38,130
do

550
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:39,800
Peterson's rhetorical strategy involves

551
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:41,940
saying something that's more or less

552
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:44,250
uncontroversially true while at the same

553
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:46,440
time implying something controversial

554
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:47,820
for instance Jordan Peterson will make a

555
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:50,250
claim like there are biological

556
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:52,350
differences between men and women which

557
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:54,240
is obviously true but he'll say it in

558
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:55,770
the context of a conversation about the

559
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:59,610
under-representation of women and

560
00:20:55,770 --> 00:21:01,500
garment which implies what exactly so

561
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:03,240
how do you respond to this well either

562
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:05,430
you fall into the trap of arguing

563
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:07,050
against the obviously true statement or

564
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:09,570
you have to guess at what he's implying

565
00:21:07,050 --> 00:21:11,760
in response to which he can accuse you

566
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:13,200
of misrepresenting him which is exactly

567
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:15,330
what happened with the Kathy Newman

568
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,130
interview the most famous moment were

569
00:21:15,330 --> 00:21:19,440
Peters and dozens is the notorious

570
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:22,230
lobster argument so he starts by saying

571
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:25,530
here's this idea that hierarchical

572
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:27,690
structures are a sociological construct

573
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:29,490
of the Western patriarchy and then he

574
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:32,070
goes on to say that lobsters exist in

575
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:34,290
hierarchies and lobsters predate Western

576
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:37,200
patriarchy by millions of years so

577
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:39,180
checkmate postmodern neo-marxists you're

578
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:41,520
saying that we should organize our

579
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:43,530
societies along the lines of the

580
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:45,180
lobsters I'm saying that it's inevitable

581
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:47,040
that there will be continuity in the way

582
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:48,990
that animals and human beings organizing

583
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:51,510
organize their structures the problem

584
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:54,270
with that is that no one has ever said

585
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:56,460
that every hierarchy is the product of

586
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:58,380
Western patriarchy this is such a

587
00:21:56,460 --> 00:22:00,300
massive straw man that it overshadows

588
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:02,430
any uncharitable interpretation of

589
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:04,740
Peterson suggested by Kathy Newman in

590
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:07,020
this interview no one on the Left denies

591
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:09,510
that there are some natural hierarchies

592
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:11,520
even the anarchists whose whole thing is

593
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:14,280
abolishing hierarchies limit themselves

594
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:16,260
to the abolition of unjust hierarchies

595
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:17,970
no one wants to abolish lobster

596
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:20,190
hierarchies the hierarchies were

597
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:23,100
interested in are those of gender race

598
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:25,080
and economics within our own society to

599
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:27,060
which the lobster case as a complete non

600
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:29,430
sequitur I mean you could use Peterson's

601
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:31,980
lobster argument the same way he uses it

602
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:34,500
to justify literally any hierarchy or

603
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:36,870
Authority no matter how unjust it could

604
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:38,910
be an 18th century Republican arguing

605
00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:40,700
against the monarchy and the monarch

606
00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:43,170
could turn around and say well

607
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:45,650
hierarchies are inevitable god save the

608
00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:51,050
lobster Queen

609
00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:53,990
oh dear God my Lords ladies those lines

610
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:56,060
between present rumors and Republican

611
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:59,360
rumbling was amongst the rabble have

612
00:22:56,060 --> 00:23:02,690
compared us to summoning together let us

613
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:06,230
remind you that Nature has SIL made

614
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:09,140
lobster but some individuals be stronger

615
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:13,250
than the others therefore let not the

616
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:16,780
power of our crustacean sovereignty be

617
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:21,020
any wise and pure and does for

618
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:27,460
parliamentarians well let them vote for

619
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:27,460
kick very good thank you

620
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:32,880
I need new roommates

621
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:35,309
so I've argued that Peterson is voting

622
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:37,559
the incoherent concept of postmodern in

623
00:23:35,309 --> 00:23:39,390
Marxism that the supervillain in a

624
00:23:37,559 --> 00:23:41,520
childishly simple worldview he's

625
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:43,980
promoting where these evil leftists are

626
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:46,169
out to destroy the West now it's time to

627
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:49,020
expect the other side of this coin what

628
00:23:46,169 --> 00:23:51,419
exactly is the West well there's an

629
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:53,130
academic usage of the term the West that

630
00:23:51,419 --> 00:23:54,870
describes the intellectual tradition

631
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:57,090
that runs from ancient Athens to

632
00:23:54,870 --> 00:23:58,679
modern-day Europe and its colonies now a

633
00:23:57,090 --> 00:24:00,570
true post modernist would want to

634
00:23:58,679 --> 00:24:02,610
deconstruct the whole concept of the

635
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:05,309
West and show how the very idea is

636
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:07,710
racist and exclusionary and supremacist

637
00:24:05,309 --> 00:24:09,480
and justify his imperialism and all that

638
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:11,220
kind of thing but we don't have time for

639
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:13,230
that right now so I'm just gonna grab

640
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:14,909
that the West is a thing and look at how

641
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:16,830
Jordan Peters and thinks about it for

642
00:24:14,909 --> 00:24:19,559
Peterson the West seems to be equivalent

643
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:21,539
to capitalism individualism the idea

644
00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:23,539
that each human has a spark of divinity

645
00:24:21,539 --> 00:24:26,039
and he therefore equates it with

646
00:24:23,539 --> 00:24:28,230
judeo-christian values a term more

647
00:24:26,039 --> 00:24:30,120
popular with conservative pundits than

648
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:32,490
intellectual historians speeders and

649
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:34,500
contrasts judeo-christian values with

650
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:36,809
postmodern neo Marxism which he

651
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:39,929
describes as anti Western collectivist

652
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:41,789
relativist and totalitarian this framing

653
00:24:39,929 --> 00:24:43,950
of a conflict of ideas in terms of

654
00:24:41,789 --> 00:24:46,280
geographical chauvinism and external

655
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:48,720
threat is inaccurate and scaremongering

656
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:51,360
Marxism is Western philosophy

657
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,770
post-modernism is Western philosophy if

658
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:54,690
you're really concerned about preserving

659
00:24:52,770 --> 00:24:56,429
the geographical boundaries of the

660
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:57,809
intellectual tradition you should be

661
00:24:56,429 --> 00:25:00,630
ranting against the influence of

662
00:24:57,809 --> 00:25:03,179
Buddhism likewise there is no feature of

663
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:05,400
SJW ideology that is meaningfully

664
00:25:03,179 --> 00:25:07,559
non-western the very idea of people

665
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:09,900
requesting different pronouns to suit

666
00:25:07,559 --> 00:25:11,390
their individual needs is exactly the

667
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:14,100
kind of thing a person who values

668
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:16,049
individual liberty over collective dogma

669
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:17,850
should be on board with could even argue

670
00:25:16,049 --> 00:25:19,710
that Marxism is an extension of

671
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:22,169
enlightenment philosophy with its

672
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:23,880
concern for human progress science and

673
00:25:22,169 --> 00:25:25,860
liberty I think a lot of people like

674
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:27,750
listening to Jordan Pederson talk about

675
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:29,250
the Western tradition but they don't

676
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:31,590
seem to like reading any of it

677
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:34,020
themselves if you did read it you'd find

678
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:36,149
a surprising diversity of thought that

679
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:38,220
doesn't reduce to judeo-christian values

680
00:25:36,149 --> 00:25:40,500
much of Plato's

681
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:43,350
are concerned with arguing against

682
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:44,760
cultural relativism suggesting that far

683
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:47,010
from being an invention of the post

684
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:49,380
modernity it was actually a pretty

685
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:51,570
popular worldview among ancient Athenian

686
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:54,090
pederasts her favorite Enlightenment

687
00:25:51,570 --> 00:25:57,030
philosopher David Hume famously said

688
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:59,580
that reason is and not only to be the

689
00:25:57,030 --> 00:26:01,650
slave of the passions literally feels

690
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:04,080
over reals and meanwhile his

691
00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:05,970
contemporary the Marquita solid was

692
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:08,700
advocating the abolition of morality

693
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:10,920
filling the churches with scat porn and

694
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:13,530
ushering in a reign of untethered sexual

695
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:15,270
perversion so decadent and depraved I'm

696
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:17,970
not even allowed to talk about it on

697
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:20,250
YouTube this is the Enlightenment not

698
00:26:17,970 --> 00:26:22,530
post-modernism and it's just as much a

699
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:25,680
part of the West as Petersons soggy

700
00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:27,780
Bible padding conservatism but again and

701
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:30,810
I really can't stress this enough I

702
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:33,300
don't care either way I make youtube

703
00:26:30,810 --> 00:26:35,700
videos because I enjoy mood lighting and

704
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:38,070
set design so what do you people want

705
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:39,630
from me the lobster queen is dead long

706
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:59,839
live the Queen

707
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:59,839
[Music]

708
00:27:04,010 --> 00:27:20,900
[Music]

709
00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:33,589
[Music]

710
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:40,830
there is a day there's and I think you

711
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:43,500
would agree that there's just a

712
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:45,000
foundational erosion that I think people

713
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:46,890
of all sides and I think there's totally

714
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,800
intellectually smart people on the far

715
00:27:46,890 --> 00:27:51,650
left that can help that where are those

716
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:54,150
people there's a there's a there's a

717
00:27:51,650 --> 00:27:56,940
youtuber that I'm actually quite

718
00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:58,290
interested in that I watch her type and

719
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:59,740
I don't mean the misgender Hercules I

720
00:27:58,290 --> 00:28:00,970
think she has

721
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:02,710
contra points I don't know if you're

722
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:03,850
part of this of this youtuber who's on

723
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:05,890
the phone I've seen the name come up

724
00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:07,630
every now and again I totally disagree

725
00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:08,920
with everything this person says but I

726
00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:12,250
look at it I'm like this seems very

727
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:16,080
reasonable educated academic and I saw

728
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:19,440
I'm seeing reasons to hope that everyone

729
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:19,440
hello Dave
