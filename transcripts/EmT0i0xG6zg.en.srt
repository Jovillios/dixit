00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:17,439
Anita the most famous bigot in American

7
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:21,080
LGBT history is a woman called Anita

Bryant this is her

9
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:30,199
story 1977 was not a good time to be gay

10
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:33,360
is it ever really a good time to be gay

11
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:35,320
in 1969 The Stonewall riots forced gay

12
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,680

13
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:39,800

homosexuality as a mental disorder but

17
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:48,399
only after gay activists disrupted their

18
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:51,440
conference and shouted gay conversion

19
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:55,320
therapy is torture we have abnormal

20
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:57,160
urges and we will not be

21
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,600
silenced because that's the only way to

22
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:00,359
get anything done in this country you

23
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:03,320

24
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:06,479
they give you no choice on January 18th

25
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:09,400

00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:11,600
popular cities as Miami approved a law

27
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:13,280
that added the phrase affectional or

28
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:15,520
sexual preference to its

29
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,240
non-discrimination ordinance effectively

30

Banning housing and employment

discrimination on the basis of sexual

32
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:24,079
orientation and it was just then as

33
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:27,000
things seemed to be getting better that

34
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:30,479
Anita Bryant made her little appearance

00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,640

commercials with the tagline a day

47
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,719

48
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,680
without Sunshine breakfast without

49
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:07,280

50
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,440
Sunshine cute when Anita heard her

51
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,440
pastor speak about this

52
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:13,879
non-discrimination ordinance she felt a

53
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:16,000
Divine disturbance in her heart how

54
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:17,120
touching according to the word of God

55
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,080
it's an

56
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:22,959
Abomination uh to practice homosexuality

57
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,720
as a mother she would not stand for this

58
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:26,800
so Anita wrote a letter to the county

59
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,959
commissioner saying as a concerned

60
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,599
mother of four children I am most

61
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:32,599
definitely against this ordinance

62
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:34,160
amendment I have never condoned nor

63
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:36,280
taught my children discrimination

64
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:38,560
against anyone but if this ordinance

65
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:41,239
amendment is allowed to become law you

66
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:43,360
will in fact be infringing upon my

67
00:02:41,239 --> 00:02:45,360
rights and discriminating against me as

68
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,360
a citizen and a mother to teach my

69
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:50,040
children God's moral code as stated in

70
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:52,360
the Holy scriptures Anita kill your

71
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:54,840
shitty child when the amendment passed

72
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:57,920
Anita created a campaign for its repeal

73
00:02:54,840 --> 00:03:00,280
the save our children Coalition which

74
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,560
sponsored provocative tv ads in implying

75
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:05,080
that gay people are degenerates who ruin

76
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,799
communities and seduce children the

77
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:08,480
campaign has been vicious with

78
00:03:06,799 --> 00:03:10,519
television commercials the Savar

79
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:13,000
children group is appealing to parental

80
00:03:10,519 --> 00:03:15,120
anxieties saying gays will F their

81
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,799
homosexuality before impressionable

82
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,599
children the Orange Bowl Parade Miami's

83
00:03:17,799 --> 00:03:22,519
gift to the nation wholesome

84
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:24,519
entertainment but in San Francisco when

85
00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:27,159
they take to the streets it's a parade

86
00:03:24,519 --> 00:03:29,280
of homosexuals men hugging other men

87
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:31,560
cavorting with little boys save our

88
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,360
children sparked the first organized

89
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:35,760
backlash to gay rights in the United

90
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:38,239
States escalating the conflict into a

91
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:40,319
national controversy on one side were

92
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:42,159
the gay rights activists who argued that

93
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:44,920
non-discrimination was a matter of human

94
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:46,560
rights on the opposing side Anita Bryant

95
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:49,280
argued that the non-discrimination

96
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,680
ordinance would give special privileges

97
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:54,519
to homosexuals we all believe in human

98
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,519
rights but we don't believe uh human

99
00:03:54,519 --> 00:03:58,519
rights that would corrupt our children

100
00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:00,760
or for individuals to have special

101
00:03:58,519 --> 00:04:03,120
privileges that would go against the

102
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:04,159
constitutional rights of normal America

103
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,760
as long as they don't want to flaunt

104
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:07,360
their homosexuality they have equal

105
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,360
rights the same as anyone else in other

106
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,360
words gay people already have equal

107
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:14,439
rights just as long as they stay in the

108
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:18,720
closet and don't do anything gay that's

109
00:04:14,439 --> 00:04:23,040
very helpful thank you so much Anita for

110
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:25,759
standing up for our right to be gay in

111
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,040
secret as long as they do their job and

112
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,800
do not want to come out of the closet

113
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,320
and force their homosexuality uh on me

114
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,720
in the areas of of business or in the

115
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:35,639
schools they can they can live their

116
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:37,440
life and I'm we're not going out after

117
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:40,280
their jobs or trying to get them out of

118
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:43,080
their teaching JS Anita also argued that

119
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:45,479
allowing flaunting homosexuals to teach

120
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:47,960
children was tantamount to gay

121
00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:49,960
recruitment just biologically the God

122
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:52,039
made mother so that we could reproduce

123
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:54,759
homosexuals cannot reproduce

124
00:04:52,039 --> 00:04:57,000
biologically but they have to reproduce

125
00:04:54,759 --> 00:04:58,560
by recruiting our children it's the

126
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,880
exact same argument that's being used

127
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,600
today by rightwing politicians who claim

128
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:07,360
that queer people are groomers stop

129
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:10,720
confusing our babies with your groomer

130
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:13,560
gender ideologue this wicked book me and

131
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:16,520
Earl and the dying girl sexually

132
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:17,960
indoctrinated with Wicked vile books and

133
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:19,479
she believes in traditional marriage

134
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:21,680
between a man and a woman and in that

135
00:05:19,479 --> 00:05:23,720
book it talked about two moms stay away

136
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,479
from the children creep or you will

137
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:26,600
regret it people should definitely arm

138
00:05:25,479 --> 00:05:28,600
themselves I agree with that the

139
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:31,000
Democrats are the party of pedophiles

140
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:33,120
the Democrats are the party of of

141
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,639
teachers uh Elementary School teachers

142
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,360
trying to trying to transition their

143
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:39,280
Elementary School age children and

144
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,120
convince them they're a different gender

145
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,759

00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,120
to Grom kids yeah they're recruiting if

147
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:48,199

148
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:51,440
where school children dress up as

149
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:54,960
animals cats or dogs during the school

150
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:59,240

people around around the country rallied

153
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,680
against Anita Bryant and save our

154
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:07,120
children there was a national boycott of

155
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:09,280
Florida orange juice with many gay bars

156
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,199
taking screwdrivers off the menu and

157
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:14,080
replacing them with an apple juice and

158
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:16,800
vodka cocktail called an Anita Bryant

159
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,840
let's make one now forgot my cocktail

163
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:27,479
[Music]

164
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:29,960
stir needs a

165
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:32,720
garnish stunning I mean it's not as good

166
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:34,039
as a screwdriver but if I was in the 70s

167
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,520
I would have thrown back so many of

168
00:06:34,039 --> 00:06:38,400
these goddamn things out of pure spite

169
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:39,800
there's a story that Troy Perry the

170
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,199
founder of the gay affirming

171
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:44,160
Metropolitan Community Church was on a

172
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:45,759
transcontinental flight and when the

173
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,680
attendant put a glass of orange trees on

174
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:51,960
his tray he said take that away I'm a

175
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:54,759
homosexual at gay pride marches in 1977

176
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:57,120
and 78 anti- Anita Bryant slogans

177
00:06:54,759 --> 00:07:00,240
featured prominently on t-shirts signs

178
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:02,479
and buttons Anita Bryant sucks Orange es

179
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:05,000
a day without lesbians is like a day

180
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:07,400
without Sunshine true and meanwhile

181
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,599
Anita's campaign inspired more anti-gay

182
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:11,879
legislation including bans on gay

183
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:13,840
adoption and same-sex marriage both of

184
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:15,720
which passed in the Florida Senate as

185
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,479
well as the failed Briggs initiative in

186
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:19,960
California which would have forced

187
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:22,199
public schools to fire gay teachers so

188
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:24,440
Anita Bryant was worse than a bigot she

189
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:26,919
was an influential bigot but she may

190
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:29,120
also have helped to unify and Galvanize

191
00:07:26,919 --> 00:07:31,080
gay activists by providing them with a

192
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,759
common enemy according to historian

193
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:35,560
lilan faderman Anita Bryant created

194
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:37,800
fervent activists out of those who'd

195
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:40,080
previously been content simply to enjoy

196
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:42,160
their Newfound freedoms faderman cites

197
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:44,159
Eric Hoffer's observation that a mass

198
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,080
movement can get along fine without a

199
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:48,000
God but it won't get along at all

200
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:50,759
without a devil for gay people all over

201
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,800
the country Anita Bryant became that

202
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:55,319
devil I think that she is ring the

203
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,960
community together like I have never

204
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:58,680
seen before there's no way I could have

205
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:01,360
done it on my own so even though she

206
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:03,599
succeeded her initial goal to repeal the

207
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,680
non-discrimination ordinance there is no

208
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:08,000
question that in the long term Anita

209
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:10,720
Bryant was the loser she took a lot of

210
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,759
L's rip that must be super hard for her

211
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:15,199
for the short remainder of her career

212
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:17,120
gay activists protested her events they

213
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:19,000
shut down the tour for her book about

214
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,400
how persecuted she was by the militant

215
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,840
homosexual and they succeeded in turning

216
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:25,440
public opinion against Anita Bryant to

217
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,879
the point that she became virtually

218
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:29,680
unemployable in mainstream entertainment

219
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:31,960
and helped that she came across as kind

220
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:34,120
of a judgmental prude that even hip

221
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:36,719
straight people didn't want to be

222
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:39,320
associated with our top story tonight

223
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:42,240
Anita Bryant former mediocre actress and

224
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:45,279
orange juice promoter performed coetus

225
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:48,200
in public yesterday and campaign to

226
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:50,519
promote heterosexuality we don't serve

227
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:52,440
orange juice anymore like she famously

228
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:54,560
told Playboy magazine why do you think

229
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:56,040
the homosexuals are called fruits it's

230
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,360
because they eat the forbidden fruit of

231
00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:00,519
the Tree of Life God referred to men as

232
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:03,079
trees and because the homosexuals eat

233
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:05,760
the forbidden fruit which is male sperm

234
00:09:03,079 --> 00:09:07,959
oh my God like the woman is heterosexual

235
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:11,320
cringe this is how you lose the culture

236
00:09:07,959 --> 00:09:11,320
War so let's

237
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:19,399
allice around and of course there was

238
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:21,600
the famous incident where a gay activist

239
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:23,760
smashed a banana cream pie in Anita's

240
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,680
face during a TV appearance and went

241
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:28,800
into a place called Northport Virginia

242
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:33,320
and were met with protest and um um all

243
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:35,839
kinds of problems and uh uh

244
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:38,480
every security agent security agent no

245
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:41,040
no let him stay let him stay well at

246
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,079
least it's a fruit pie Miami Dade County

247
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,959
finally reinstated the

248
00:09:42,079 --> 00:09:46,519
non-discrimination ordinance in 1998 and

249
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:50,279
they added gender identity to its

250
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:52,600
Protections in 2014 in 2021 Anita took

251
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:55,120
another metaphorical pie to the face

252
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:57,519
when her granddaughter Sarah Green came

253
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:59,720
out as gay announcing her marriage to a

254
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:01,519
woman in publicly struggling with

255
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:04,560
whether to even invite her grandmother

256
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:06,839
to the ceremony it's very hard to argue

257
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:09,640
with someone who thinks that like an

258
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:11,440
integral part of your identity is just

259
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:15,600
uh an evil

260
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:17,440
delusion that it is Sarah that it is so

261
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,880
that's the story of Anita Bryant as

262
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:22,680
students of LGBT history know it but

263
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:26,120
isn't it a bit one-sided wasn't there a

264
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:28,519
lot of toxicity on both sides the Anita

265
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:30,800
Bryant forces talk of absolute truth and

266
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:32,959
morality gay leaders are equally

267
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:35,839
dogmatic about human rights a plague on

268
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:39,360
both the houses isn't it cruel even to

269
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:42,959
slur Anita as a bigot and a homophobe in

270
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:46,680
fact isn't it possible that Anita Bryant

271
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:46,680
was the real

272
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:51,079
victim oh no oh

273
00:10:52,279 --> 00:10:57,839
no I can't do this anymore I'm eating my

274
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:59,959
pie I'm eating my godamn pie chapter 2

275
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:03,040
The Witch Trials of Anita Bri

276
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:05,160
God help us all the mainstream media

277
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:07,760
would have us believe that Anita Bryant

278
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:09,839
is a so-called homophobe some kind of

279
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:12,440
hateful bigot but isn't this just an

280
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:15,040
authoritarian tactic used to silence

281
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:16,839
valid concerns mothers in this country

282
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:19,600
are worried about their children going

283
00:11:16,839 --> 00:11:21,600
to school to be taught by perverts how

284
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:24,839
can we be so sure that the militant

285
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:27,160
homosexuals weren't the real Bots isn't

286
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:30,839
it possible that Anita Bryant was the

287
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:34,600
first victim of cancel culture of dare I

288
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:35,839
say it wokeism well no that's the

289
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:37,800
dumbest thing I've ever heard in my

290
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:39,399
entire life but suppose that you're an

291
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:41,600
idiot and suppose that that's the

292
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:43,200
narrative you wanted to promote well

293
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,040
what would be your argument I mean if

294
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,040
someone put a gun to my head and forced

295
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:49,800
me to make that argument I'd probably

296
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:52,920
say something like this Anita Bryant

297
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:55,040
lived a difficult life in 1940 she was

298
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:57,240
born into brutal poverty in rural

299
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:59,440
Oklahoma her parents divorced when she

300
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:01,399
was just 2 years old the same year she

301
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:04,040
made her singing debut at the Baptist

302
00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:06,079
Church parts of my childhood I blocked

303
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:08,200
out because it hurts too much I guess I

304
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:09,880
was happiest when I was 8 years old and

305
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:11,720
my parents were remarried and I was

306
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:14,079
baptized and came to know Christ as my

307
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:16,760
personal savior her father abandoned the

308
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:18,800
family again when she was 12 it was real

309
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:21,440
painful and it just about killed my

310
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:24,240
mother she was a very submissive wife

311
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:26,880
she was too submissive and it angered me

312
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:29,240
she let my dad step all over her because

313
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:31,839
of him I think I went through life for a

314
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:34,560
long time hating all men Anita described

315
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:37,240
her most intense adolescent memory as a

316
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:39,079
feeling of intense ambition a Relentless

317
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:44,240
drive to succeed at doing well the thing

318
00:12:39,079 --> 00:12:48,519
I loved Glory Glory

319
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:51,880
hallelu his truth his

320
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:53,560
Maring but Anita's ambition conflicted

321
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:56,680
with her submissive role as a

322
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:59,519
traditional Christian woman in 1960

323
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:01,600
Anita married Bob Green Miami's top disc

324
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:03,720
jockey only after he relentlessly

325
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:06,800
badgered her into it this is what

326
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:06,800
heterosexuals do

327
00:13:07,959 --> 00:13:13,040
fellas green was allegedly a controlling

328
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:15,680
and abusive husband feminist Andrea

329
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:17,760
dworin claims green manipulated Bryant

330
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:19,880
with a cruelty nearly unmatched in

331
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:22,279
Modern Love Stories and Anita

332
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:24,600
rationalized the abuse saying despite

333
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:26,519
our sometimes violent scraps I love him

334
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:29,480
for it but While submitting to her

335
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:31,240
husband and raising four children an was

336
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:33,760
still able to build the career she'd

337
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:36,040
always wanted by the 1970s she was on

338
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:38,160
the payroll of big orange juice earning

339
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:40,839
half a million dollars a year enough to

340
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:43,920
move her family into a 27 room Spanish

341
00:13:40,839 --> 00:13:46,240
mansion on biscane Bay so Anita Bryant

342
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:49,000
struggled all her life for her success

343
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:51,519
did she really deserve to lose it all

344
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,480
just because she took a stand for

345
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:55,199
something she believed in andita

346
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:57,240
Bryant's role as a leader in the

347
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:59,120
campaign against homosexuals may be

348
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:01,519
hurting her campaign to sell orange

349
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:04,120
jeice are you being black bowled well

350
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:05,880
it's uh it's it looks that way it's it's

351
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:08,000
worse than that we're being threatened

352
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:11,360
and uh there's all kinds of harassment

353
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:14,199
even with my job with Florida Citrus I

354
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:17,199
haveed of

355
00:14:14,199 --> 00:14:19,680
to and all children against being

356
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:21,639
recruited by homosexuals her entire life

357
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:23,240
had become a series of catastrophes

358
00:14:21,639 --> 00:14:24,920
she'd been dropped as spokesperson by

359
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:26,440
the orange growers she had been dropped

360
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:28,600
as a commentator on the Orange Bowl

361
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:30,480
Parade she lost a television show

362
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:33,199
contract her bookings dropped

363
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:36,279
drastically it destroys theam I

364
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:39,320
have to ENT

365
00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:41,680
and my fellow Americans because I dared

366
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:43,839
to speak out for straight and normal

367
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:46,079
America no one has paid as dearly as

368
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:48,040
neita Bryant for taking a public stand

369
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:51,480
on something she believed in I remember

370
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:53,720
lying in the bed in my my mother's house

371
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:56,120
in a fetal position and wanting to die

372
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:58,320
gay activists in the 1970s didn't

373
00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:00,880
exactly limit their tactics to polite

374
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:05,759
debate in the free Marketplace of ideas

375
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:08,320
stop now stop now stop homosexuals

376
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:10,240
started fighting back the gays formed

377
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,399
new groups and picketed the performers

378
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:15,000
public appearances forcing her to cancel

379
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:18,040
a few gay activists routinely compared

380
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:20,120
Anita to Adolf H they created pases of

381
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:22,320
her orange juice slogan they blamed her

382
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:24,720
for hate crimes they burned her in

383
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:27,120
effigy they disrupted events she was

384
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:29,560
involved in they printed toilet paper

385
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:31,319
with her face on it some sent a death

386
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:34,920
threats or they mailed her rotting

387
00:15:31,319 --> 00:15:36,360
oranges dead cockroaches human excrement

388
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:38,880
see this is how you canceled people

389
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:41,519
before phones instead of [ __ ] posting

390
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:43,399
you would simply mail actual human [ __ ]

391
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:46,079
through the United States Postal Service

392
00:15:43,399 --> 00:15:48,480
neither snow nor rain nor heat nor Gloom

393
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:50,519
of night an's husband pleaded to

394
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,519
supporters how would you men feel if you

395
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:54,600
opened a letter and there was a photo of

396
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:56,680
your wife's head superimposed on some

397
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:59,319
other female nude body in the most lewd

398
00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:00,920
and shocking sexual act you can imagine

399
00:15:59,319 --> 00:16:02,680
I can imagine quite a lot I do think it

400
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:05,600
would be fair to say that a lot of the

401
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:08,120
rhetoric did take on a misogynistic tone

402
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:10,920
lilan faderman recounts that lesbians

403
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:12,800
particularly lesbian feminists abhor the

404
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:15,040
sexist terms that were being used to

405
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:17,440
characterize Anita Bryant [ __ ] and

406
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:19,240
[ __ ] gay men called her the harassment

407
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:21,199
escalated to the point where Anita had

408
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:23,720
to cancel her book tour due to

409
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:27,360
demonstrations and bomb threats from gay

410
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:30,120
activists and of course there was the

411
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:32,160
pie so much for the the tolerant mine

412
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:33,800
Society it's kind of a deep cut well

413
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:36,240
something to entertain the Boomer queers

414
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:38,319
gay activists claimed to stand for human

415
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:40,560
rights but what about Anita's rights to

416
00:16:38,319 --> 00:16:42,959
free speech I wish I had some literal

417
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:45,480
pearls to clutch civil libertarian Nat

418
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:47,600
hentoff wrote in his 1992 book free

419
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:50,079
speech for me but not for thee that the

420
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,880
orange juice boycott reminded him of a

421
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:54,040
little thing called

422
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:56,600
McCarthyism have you ever considered

423
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:59,160
that being prog gay is quite similar to

424
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:01,839
being anti-gay and that both are

425
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:04,760
opinions as Anita tells it she and her

426
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:07,280
foot soldiers of God were the victims of

427
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:09,360
sinister gay Carpet Baggers the foot

428
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:10,839
soldiers were Housewives and mothers

429
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:13,039
religious and Civic leaders in

430
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:15,360
opposition to a well organized highly

431
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:18,160
financed and politically militant group

432
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:21,760
of homosexual activists We Were cast as

433
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:24,039
bigots haters discriminators and deniers

434
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:25,839
of basic human rights and all of this

435
00:17:24,039 --> 00:17:27,520
happened because we were sincerely

436
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:29,480
concerned for our children and our

437
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:32,000
community so Anita's version of the

438
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:34,799
story is that she and a handful of

439
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:38,120
well-intentioned christian mothers were

440
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:40,799
cast as bigots by a highly funded Mafia

441
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:43,600
of gay extremists all because they had a

442
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:45,919
few Teensy tiny concerns about the

443
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:48,320
militant homosexual cavorting with

444
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:50,559
little boys cavorting with little boys

445
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:53,480
is it really fair to call this woman a

446
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:55,919
bigot until fade County ordinance Anita

447
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:57,840
was a registered Democrat and considered

448
00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:00,280
herself a liberal and she never said

449
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:02,919
that she hated G people or wanted them

450
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:06,360
dead in fact she even said that she

451
00:18:02,919 --> 00:18:08,559
loves homosexuals I love homosexuals if

452
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:10,840
you can believe that I love them enough

453
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:12,679
to tell them the truth because I know

454
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:16,200
that there is hope for the homosexuals

455
00:18:12,679 --> 00:18:18,960
that if they're willing to uh turn from

456
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:20,840
uh sin the same as any individual that

457
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,400
uh that they can be ex homosexuals the

458
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:24,960
same as there can be an ex murderer an

459
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:28,559
ex thief or ex anybody she loves

460
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:32,280
homosexuals because they can change just

461
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:35,200
like murderers would a bigot have said

462
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:37,520
that just about mcfucking had it Anita

463
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:40,480
was so kind-hearted she even said that

464
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:42,520
she related to the homosexual I can

465
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:45,000
relate to the homosexual because I've

466
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:46,880
had emotional scars in my own life I

467
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,440
really felt the rejection of my father

468
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:51,120
and that is one of the things that maybe

469
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:53,640
lead someone going into homosexuality

470
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:55,320
look I don't hate homosexuals that's the

471
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:57,080
truth no matter what they think of my

472
00:18:55,320 --> 00:19:00,159
motives I've always said I love The

473
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:02,000
Sinner but I hate the sin wow what an

474
00:19:00,159 --> 00:19:04,360
empath you know I actually think it's

475
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,559
really Noble how she's able to project

476
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:08,240
all of her own emotional baggage onto

477
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:09,679
the marginalized group whose rights

478
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:12,799
she's trying to take

479
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:14,960
away okay so we've given a fair hearing

480
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:17,760
to both sides to many sides we've

481
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:19,640
considered all the evidence now let's

482
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:23,360
suppose there's no longer a gun to my

483
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:27,240
head and ask did Anita Bryant really

484
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:29,000
deserve that pie to the face well yes

485
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:31,159
obviously look the point of trying to

486
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:34,640
make here is that it's possible to take

487
00:19:31,159 --> 00:19:37,240
genuine virtues like Nuance empathy and

488
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:39,640
impartiality and to twist them into

489
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:41,600
[ __ ] up apologia for horrible

490
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:43,520
oppressive Behavior if you play this

491
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:45,679
game long enough you can essentially

492
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:48,480
explain away the entire concept of

493
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:50,240
bigotry and conclude that in reality

494
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:52,840
there are no bigots there's only

495
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:55,520
tragically misunderstood people with

496
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:58,880
difficult childhoods and valid concerns

497
00:19:55,520 --> 00:20:01,360
cruy demonized by militant activists

498
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:05,080
defaming and silencing them with such

499
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:09,159
reputation ruining slurs as homophobe

500
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:11,919
now because you viewers are smart media

501
00:20:09,159 --> 00:20:14,120
literate people you understand framing

502
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:17,080
so you already know that I'm about to

503
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:19,799
compare aita Bryant to JK Rowling in

504
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:24,200
case you didn't know JK

505
00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:26,120
rolling JK Rowling is a popular author

506
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:28,679
who used to write Whimsical stories

507
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:30,840
about wizard school but who now writes B

508
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:32,960
books about transvesti serial killers

509
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:36,200
masturbating into stolen panties because

510
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:39,039

nightmare Chapter 3 The Witch Trials of

513
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:49,640
JK Rowling all right kids it's transing

514
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:52,640
time last year I agreed to be a guest on

515
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:55,440
a podcast about JK rolling hosted by

516
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:58,280
Megan Phelps rooper an escape from the

517
00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:01,600
westbo Baptist Church the notorious hate

518
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:03,880
group from topa Kansas most known for

519
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:08,120
protesting the funerals of soldiers with

520
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:11,200
signs that say God hates God and me both

521
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:14,159
I'm tired of you people JK Illy the

522
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:16,320
westbo Baptist Church is one of the most

523
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:20,000
famous homophobic hate groups in the

524
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:21,720
world in a way I'm like a lifelong fan

525
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,200
of these people I've watched all the

526
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:26,960
Louis through documentaries I went to a

527
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:29,080
counter protest in 2010 I remember how

528
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:31,200
when I was in high school the westbo

529
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:33,120
Baptist Church was like the one thing

530
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:36,039
that conservatives and liberals could

531
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:38,880
agree on because they hated the troops

532
00:21:36,039 --> 00:21:41,559
and the gays essentially the two genders

533
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:44,159
of 2006 but let's not pretend that the

534
00:21:41,559 --> 00:21:46,440
westro Baptist Church is all bad okay

535
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:49,320
when Megan was at westbo she used to do

536
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:51,480
these amazing Lady Gaga parodies about

537
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:55,400
how the gays are going to hell which to

538
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:58,240
this day I am a big fan of what did you

539
00:21:55,400 --> 00:22:01,080
say you think God loves your praying he

540
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:05,320
hates all you do cuz you love

541
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:08,200
fornicating for it's perfect I love it

542
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:10,919
play it at my funeral stop praying stop

543
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:14,120
praying God will not hear you anymore

544
00:22:10,919 --> 00:22:17,960
you C the boys and the girls to be proud

545
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:20,559
for forever go you just keep pushing on

546
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:23,640
to the hell where you will forever Megan

547
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:26,600
left the westbo Baptist Church in 2012

548
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:29,039
after a crisis of Faith precipitated by

549
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:31,000
a power struggle within the church

550
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:33,279
she wrote about all this in her book

551
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,960
unfollow which is honestly a pretty

552
00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:38,240
interesting account of deconversion and

553
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:40,799
the circumstances that lead someone to

554
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:43,679
leaving a hate group Megan contacted me

555
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:46,600
for her podcast because I had criticized

556
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:48,400
JK ring in a video a couple years ago

557
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:50,279
now you may be wondering why would I

558
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,960
think that a person who's been carrying

559
00:22:50,279 --> 00:22:54,880
a godh hates sign most of her life would

560
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,760
be the correct person to lead an

561
00:22:54,880 --> 00:23:00,159
international conversation about the

562
00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:03,640
intricacies of LGBT issues because I'm

563
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:05,440
an idiot happy basically I agreed to the

564
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:07,840
podcast because it's a pretty

565
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:10,520
irresistible pitch a former member of

566
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:13,440
the westbo Baptist Church wants to

567
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:15,960
mediate a conversation between me and

568
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:18,080
the author of Harry Potter would you say

569
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:21,360
no to that

570
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:23,799
maybe if you're smart last month the

571
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:26,760
podcast was announced in an essay by

572
00:23:23,799 --> 00:23:29,600
Megan titled The Witch Trials of JK

573
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:32,279
rolling obviously attend ous framing

574
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:35,080
that posits Joo as the target of an

575
00:23:32,279 --> 00:23:37,480
irrational trans Witch Hunt the essay

576
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:40,039
included a teaser quote from Rowling

577
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:42,240
complaining that she's been profoundly

578
00:23:40,039 --> 00:23:45,039
misunderstood as well as a photo of an

579
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:47,919
angry trans mob holding a rotten hell

580
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:50,039
rolling sign juxtaposed with an image of

581
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:53,480
conservative Christians burning Harry

582
00:23:50,039 --> 00:23:56,600
Potter books in the early 2000s this did

583
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:58,640
not bode well so I disavowed the podcast

584
00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:01,080
on Twitter because I didn't want my my

585
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:04,640
name lending legitimacy to some kind of

586
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:07,600
unearned JK rolling Redemption tour this

587
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:11,039
caused Megan's mom surely to quote tweet

588
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:13,520
me calling me a bigot against God I mean

589
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:16,080
God is one of the most vulnerable

590
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:18,320
minorities there's only one of him and

591
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:20,760
he could really use your help surely I

592
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:24,360
said in these tweets that I felt used

593
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:26,600
which that is how I felt but ultimately

594
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:28,440
I need to take full responsibility for

595
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:30,120
my involvement in this the thing about

596
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:32,520
about being a guest on a documentary

597
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:34,360
like this is you honestly have no idea

598
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:36,880
what the final product is going to be

599
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:39,600
like so the decision to participate is

600
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:42,279
always a leap of faith and I can't

601
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:44,799
really say that Megan misled me there

602
00:24:42,279 --> 00:24:47,240
were red flags from the beginning and I

603
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:49,679
ignored them because I was projecting my

604
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:52,600
own hopes onto the situation you know

605
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:55,760
it's a compelling story i' liked to the

606
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:58,559
idea that this famous former bigot could

607
00:24:55,760 --> 00:25:01,600
talk some sense into a famous current

608
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:04,320
bigot we all love a good Redemption Arc

609
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:06,200
and I started my career der radicalizing

610
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:08,480
the alt right that's something I've

611
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:10,520
moved away from but there's still part

612
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:12,799
of me that wants to see the best in

613
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:16,080
people and to believe that people can

614
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:18,039
change if you just talk to them and make

615
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:21,600
a good enough

616
00:25:18,039 --> 00:25:23,760
argument maybe my wishful thinking was

617
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:26,679
that because Megan left

618
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:29,880
westbo that must mean that she must

619
00:25:26,679 --> 00:25:33,480
understand the intricacies of anti-lgbt

620
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:36,480
bigotry right and despite no evidence

621
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:39,440
for this My Hope was that Megan would

622
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:42,279
act as the trans Ally and could be

623
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:45,960
really effective at confronting Joo

624
00:25:42,279 --> 00:25:50,679
about all the transphobic stuff she says

625
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:52,870
right wrong I'm Megan phes rer and these

626
00:25:50,679 --> 00:25:56,399
are the Witch Trials of JK

627
00:25:52,870 --> 00:25:59,679
[Music]

628
00:25:56,399 --> 00:26:03,600
ruling the witch trial of JK Rowling is

629
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:05,960
more than 7 hours of apologetics for JKR

630
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:09,480
the podcast presents rolling as a

631
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:12,320
complex Humane heroic figure with an

632
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:14,559
inspiring feminist backstory Joe

633
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:17,520
Rowling's rise to success is this sort

634
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:22,799
of feminist Cinderella story now cruy

635
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:22,799
besieged by a vicious mob of transgender

636
00:26:23,399 --> 00:26:30,799
activists all because she as a woman had

637
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:35,279
a few tiny concerns about the

638
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:38,520
transgender rapists I had been becoming

639
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:40,760
increasingly concerned about the way in

640
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:44,200
which women were being shut down women

641
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:46,440
who I felt had some very valid concerns

642
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:49,720
Megan uncritically accepts Ring's

643
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:52,840
framing of the conflict as feminists

644
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:55,840
versus trans rights activists whom

645
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:58,840
Rowling describes as a powerful

646
00:26:55,840 --> 00:27:02,840
Insidious misogynistic movement for the

647
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:05,720
first 5 hours of this podcast Rowling's

648
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:09,720
critics are presented as an irrational

649
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:12,840
mob of enraged shrieking sexually

650
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:14,480
violent Fanatics you are

651
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:18,039
murdering

652
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:20,159
children get up a huge amount of I want

653
00:27:18,039 --> 00:27:22,360
her to choke on my fat trans dick and

654
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:25,200
you did it at my birthday dinner there's

655
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:28,240
this one clip of some kind of antifa

656
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:31,440
super soldiers abrasive screaming that

657
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:34,279
they play like once per episode [ __ ] you

00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:37,080

00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:45,360
you will die alone and then it usually

662
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:47,919
cuts to like somber Monks chanting some

663
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:51,440
kind of medieval lament you will die

664
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:51,440
alone and you will burn in

665
00:27:54,640 --> 00:28:00,340
hell just in case you didn't get from

666
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:05,840
the ti that this is a Witch

671
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:21,720
irrational misogynistic trans rights

672
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:25,360
Fanatics are contrasted with this

673
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:28,120
poignant story of how JK Rowling escaped

674
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:31,000
her abusive husband to publish our gener

675
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:33,760
generation's most beloved novels I was

676
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:36,240
still very committed to those parts that

677
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:38,600
I plotted in darkness as it were because

678
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:41,200
there was a truth to them and there was

679
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:44,840
a power to them the only voices of

680
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:48,640
genuine trans descent appear in episode

681
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:51,640
6 out of seven more than 5 hours in and

682
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:54,679
there's only two of us one is

683
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:57,600
me shame and the other is a teenager

684
00:28:54,679 --> 00:29:00,720
named Noah who kind of just seems like

685
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:03,039
he wants to be liked and understood and

686
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:06,279
wishes that his favorite author would

687
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:08,240
please stop saying bigoted things about

688
00:29:06,279 --> 00:29:10,360
him I'm such a big Harry Potter fan or I

689
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:12,799
was such a big Harry Potter fan

690
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:15,440
especially because it was so hard to be

691
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:18,080
in the real world I can't even State how

692
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:21,320
important it was to me shk Rowling I

693
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:23,600
stole her biography from my third grade

694
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:25,159
classroom and I kept it for a long time

695
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:27,600
cuz I just loved reading it cuz I just

696
00:29:25,159 --> 00:29:29,919
admired her so much it's honestly pretty

697
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:31,799
heartbreaking to listen to on my last

698
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:33,760
day editing this video I got in touch

699
00:29:31,799 --> 00:29:35,399
with Noah I asked him if he had any

700
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:38,039
thoughts about the podcast he wanted me

701
00:29:35,399 --> 00:29:39,679
to pass along and this is what he said I

702
00:29:38,039 --> 00:29:41,279
want to emphasize that the stakes of

703
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:43,600
this issue are very different from any

704
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:45,279
sort of rhetorical debate conversation

705
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:46,919
dialogue and debate are important but

706
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:48,720
for many of the most vulnerable people

707
00:29:46,919 --> 00:29:50,399
in society the outcome of this

708
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,679
conversation dictates their health

709
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:54,640
well-being and ability to survive how we

710
00:29:52,679 --> 00:29:55,880
treat or talk to people like JK Rowling

711
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:58,039
should come second to fighting for

712
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:59,720
maintained access to healthcare support

713
00:29:58,039 --> 00:30:01,399
support and general resources for

714
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:04,159
children and Adolescent seeking gender

715
00:30:01,399 --> 00:30:06,279
care I agree the most frustrating thing

716
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:09,120
about this podcast is that it refuses to

717
00:30:06,279 --> 00:30:11,679
be honest about what it is they spend 7

718
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:14,039
hours implying that JK Rowling is the

719
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:17,000
victim of a Witch Hunt in the most heavy

720
00:30:14,039 --> 00:30:19,679
handed way imaginable these are the

721
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:23,240
Witch Trials of JK

722
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:25,760
rolling I mean Turf is basically witch

723
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:28,919
but if you point this out they just deny

724
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:30,840
it show me the actual words sh Show me

725
00:30:28,919 --> 00:30:33,519

00:30:58,639 --> 00:31:05,000
why would you even think that you're

738
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:07,799
crazy by the way come get your this

739
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:11,039
which doesn't burn t-shirt for sale now

740
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:12,639
at wild woman workshop and Megan is not

741
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:15,120
much better like there's this whole

742
00:31:12,639 --> 00:31:17,480
section in episode 2 where Megan

743
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:20,360
interviews Christians who burned Harry

744
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:22,960
Potter books in the 1990s and this is

745
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:24,840
obviously meant to be foreshadowing so

746
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:27,159
looking back would you say that the

747
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:29,960
Christian parents were maybe part of a

748
00:31:27,159 --> 00:31:32,519
moral panic yeah absolutely it's a Scary

749
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:34,840
World out there Megan doesn't explicitly

750
00:31:32,519 --> 00:31:36,840
say she thinks trans protests against

751
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:39,880
Joe row are equivalent to the Christian

752
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:42,480
ones in the 9s but she does heavily

753
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:45,600
imply it there was an explosive reaction

754
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:48,399
to Rowling's tweets which led many

755
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:50,840
including lifelong fans of her work to

756
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:55,440
condemn her and to call for her books to

757
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:58,039
be banned boycotted and in some cases

758
00:31:55,440 --> 00:32:00,679
burned when confronted about the obvious

759
00:31:58,039 --> 00:32:03,679
implications of the podcast's title

760
00:32:00,679 --> 00:32:05,880
Megan said the title is ambiguous toward

761
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:08,200
the end of our conversations I spent a

762
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:10,720
long time talking with JK Rowling about

763
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:12,600
discernment about how a person can ever

764
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:15,279
know if they're standing up for what

765
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:17,679
right or joining a moral panic I think

766
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:19,200
you'll be surprised by the thoughts she

767
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:22,519
shares

768
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:24,080
Megan I was not surprised I know I won't

769
00:32:22,519 --> 00:32:26,559
ever regret having stood up on this

770
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:29,159
issue ever the podcast released new

771
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:31,080
episodes weekly and whenever Megan was

772
00:32:29,159 --> 00:32:33,799
challenged about the blatant

773
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:35,480
one-sidedness Megan would respond oh you

774
00:32:33,799 --> 00:32:38,080
just think that because you haven't

775
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:40,760
listened to the whole podcast yet maybe

776
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:43,360
you should preserve judgment much more

777
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:46,960
of other perspectives is coming make

778
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:50,799
sure to tune in next week more bombshell

779
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:54,080
Revelations to come well I've listened

780
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:57,080
to the whole podcast now and I truly do

781
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:59,320
not think that anyone with basic media

782
00:32:57,080 --> 00:33:01,679
comprehensions skills could come away

783
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:04,399
from this thinking that the main intent

784
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:07,399
was anything other than to portray JK

785
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:09,440
Rowling as the marter of an

786
00:33:07,399 --> 00:33:13,440
unjust

787
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:15,840
uh what's the word Witch Hunt this is

788
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:18,679
the obvious implication of the podcast

789
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:21,279
from the first words to the very last

790
00:33:18,679 --> 00:33:23,559
and of course rolling does literally get

791
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:26,000
the last word the final episode

792
00:33:23,559 --> 00:33:27,519
concludes with this there are more

793
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,360
important things in this world than

794
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:30,519
being

795
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:33,360
popular and that doesn't mean it's more

796
00:33:30,519 --> 00:33:34,960
important to me to be right it means

797
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:37,480
it's more important to me to do the

798
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:40,200
right thing why would you end on that

799
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:43,240
note why would anything about this

800
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:46,399
podcast be the way it is if Megan didn't

801
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:48,720
fundamentally believe that JK Rowling is

802
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:50,760
in the right I don't regret it because I

803
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:52,919
did the right thing like there really is

804
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:55,240
no other reasonable way to interpret

805
00:33:52,919 --> 00:33:58,399
this so I wish that she would just be

806
00:33:55,240 --> 00:34:01,080
honest if you believe that JK is the

807
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:04,120
Misunderstood victim of a Witch Hunt

808
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:07,080
then just say that make the argument you

809
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:10,240
want to make don't Crouch and hide

810
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:13,960
behind this disavow this obfuscating

811
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:18,599
veil of just asking questions don't rely

812
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:21,520
on inuendo and Framing and lack foros

813
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:24,320
Gregorian chanting to make your point

814
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:27,919
while coily denying you have any kind of

815
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:30,520
agenda Beyond I just believe in convers

816
00:34:27,919 --> 00:34:34,119
ation I don't know I just find this a

817
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:36,079
slippery and dishonest way to argue but

818
00:34:34,119 --> 00:34:39,159
if you happen to be a fan of slippery

819
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:43,720
and dishonest arguments you're in luck

820
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:46,720
because there is more where that came

I'm going full Slytherin in episode five

of The Witch Trials of JK rolling Joo

Compares trans activists to Death Eaters

842
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:44,640
the fictionalized fascists in Harry

843
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:47,280
Potter my position is that this activist

844
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:49,800
movement in the form that it's currently

845
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:51,760
taking Echoes the very thing that I was

846
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:54,040
warning against in Harry Potter the

847
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:56,920
death eat has claimed we have been made

848
00:35:54,040 --> 00:36:00,440
to live in secret and now is our time I

849
00:35:56,920 --> 00:36:03,280
am fighting what I see as a powerful

850
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:05,160
Insidious misogynistic movement when an

851
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:07,200
article then claimed she had equated

852
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:10,079
trans people to death theaters the

853
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:12,119
podcast's pr firm reached out demanding

854
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:15,400
a correction because she only equated

855
00:36:12,119 --> 00:36:17,760
the movement to death theaters not trans

856
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:19,640
people in general yeah I don't hate

857
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:21,680
marginalized people I just hate it when

858
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:23,400
they advocate for themselves so I do

859
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:25,680
have to be very careful with my wording

860
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:28,280
here lest a defamation letter arrive by

861
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:30,400
Owl JK Ring's bigotry is exhausting to

862
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:33,079
argue with because she expresses it as

863
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:35,599
an endless series of what are called M

864
00:36:33,079 --> 00:36:37,960
and Bailey arguments a m and Bailey

865
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:40,640
argument is named after a type of Castle

866
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:43,680
consisting of a Mot that is a tower at

867
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:46,079
top of Mound or Hill easy to defend and

868
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:48,480
a Bailey a fenced Courtyard that's much

869
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:50,920
more vulnerable to attack difficult to

870
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:52,839
defend so a motten Bailey argument is

871
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:55,720
when someone makes a provocative claim

872
00:36:52,839 --> 00:36:57,720
that's difficult to defend the Bailey

873
00:36:55,720 --> 00:37:00,000
and then when confronted with counter

874
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:02,160
arguments they walk it back to a much

875
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:06,400
less controversial and easy to defend

876
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:08,520
version of the claim the mot for example

877
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:11,560
Rowling will make an ambiguous claim

878
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:14,119
like sex is real what does she mean by

879
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:16,359
that what are the implications well in

880
00:37:14,119 --> 00:37:18,520
the podcast she explains that she thinks

881
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:21,400
it's very Sinister that in the

882
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:22,760
Associated Press style guide it says

883
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:25,839
that instead of referring to a

884
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:27,640
transwoman as a man who identifies as a

885
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:30,760
woman journalists should simply say say

886
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:33,440
a transwoman is a woman that from the

887
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:36,680
Associated Press is hugely powerful

888
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:38,920
they've edged from identifies as a woman

889
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:40,160
so a man identifies as a woman which and

890
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:42,640
I think we all understand what that

891
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:45,560
means into is a woman and that's

892
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:50,359
precisely the creep that I'm talking

893
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:52,319
about we are using language to make

894
00:37:50,359 --> 00:37:54,839
accurate definition of sex

895
00:37:52,319 --> 00:37:57,720
difference unspeakable which is of

896
00:37:54,839 --> 00:38:00,720
course false because the words trans and

897
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:03,000
CIS exist precisely to make it easy to

898
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:05,079
talk about sex difference thanks a lot

899
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:07,240
Tumblr God there's this whole section of

900
00:38:05,079 --> 00:38:09,079
the podcast that sort of implies that

901
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:11,599
transgender people were invented on

902
00:38:09,079 --> 00:38:13,640
Tumblr which I'm not even going to get

903
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:15,040
into because we don't have time roling

904
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:17,119
has also tweeted that she thinks that

905
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:19,960
all people who menstruate must be

906
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:22,240
referred to as women or was it Wen I'm

907
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:24,599
pretty sure it was wump mud so trans men

908
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:27,520
and trans masculine people they're all

909
00:38:24,599 --> 00:38:30,440
women and must be referred to as women

910
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:32,760
because JK Rowling demands it this is

911
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:35,079
controversial right calling trans women

912
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:38,040
men who identify as women calling

913
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:40,319
transmen women this is the Bailey in her

914
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:42,520
ma and Bailey argument trans women are

915
00:38:40,319 --> 00:38:45,119
men trans men are women that's the

916
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:47,520
controversial interpretation of sex is

917
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:50,079
real now when accused of transphobia and

918
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:52,200
facing backlash Rowling walks the

919
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:54,359
argument back and says I'm being

920
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:56,599
persecuted just for saying that women

921
00:38:54,359 --> 00:38:59,240
should be allowed to discuss how being

922
00:38:56,599 --> 00:39:01,760
female has shed shaped our lives women

923
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:04,079
should be allowed to discuss how being

924
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:06,440
female has shaped our lives this is the

925
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:10,079
obvious and utterly uncontroversial

926
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:12,400
interpretation of sex is real the m and

927
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:14,599
virtually every argument sophisticated

928
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:16,920
transphobes make about trans people

929
00:39:14,599 --> 00:39:19,280
follows this pattern JK Ring's friend

930
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:21,800
and Ally Maya forat will tweet

931
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:23,839
inflammatory things like men cannot

932
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:25,960
change into women but then when she's

933
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:28,760
criticized she'll say that she's being

934
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:31,040
attacked for gender critical belief

935
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:34,000
gender critical belief which is the

936
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:36,359
absolutely ordinary belief about sex

937
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:39,160
that your mother and your grandmother

938
00:39:36,359 --> 00:39:42,079
are women being female is a thing your

939
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:44,720
mother and grandmother are women being

940
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:46,920
female is a thing that's literally all

941
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:49,960
I'm saying but if that's literally all

942
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:53,880
she was saying then no one would be mad

943
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:56,839
would they nine Nar men cannot change

944
00:39:53,880 --> 00:40:00,160
into women is the Bailey your mom is a

945
00:39:56,839 --> 00:40:02,359
woman is the mod your mom's a

946
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:04,599
woman this is why arguing with these

947
00:40:02,359 --> 00:40:06,800
people is infuriating they'll insinuate

948
00:40:04,599 --> 00:40:09,359
that trans women are dangerous rapists

949
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:11,720
exhibitionists and vur then when trans

950
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:14,079
people understandably get mad they'll

951
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:16,119
say look I'm being attacked just for

952
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:18,520
saying that being female is part of my

953
00:40:16,119 --> 00:40:20,240
experience it's dishonest they talk a

954
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:22,240
bunch of trash about trans people and

955
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:23,240
then when trans people talk trash back

956
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:25,240
they pretend that they're being

957
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:27,839
victimized for making totally innocuous

958
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:30,960
statements we can name this Behavior the

959
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:33,880
birthday boy argument I dated a 58 guy

960
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:35,560
who taunt every jacked 63 bro he met

961
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:38,319
until they'd pull their fist back to

962
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:40,800
beat him up whereupon my ex would go hey

963
00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:43,720
hey hey come on I'm a little guy I'm

964
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:46,480
just a little guy no it's also my

965
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:48,640
birthday I'm a little birthday boy and

966
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:50,720
somehow it always worked so a birthday

967
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:53,400
boy argument is when you make aggressive

968
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:55,720
inflammatory assertions followed by

969
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:57,680
teacher teacher look what he's doing to

970
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:59,760
me when the target reacts with anything

971
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:01,200
less than extreme politeness another

972
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:03,480
common tactic you'll see anytime

973
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:05,440
Rowling's transphobia is discussed is

974
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:07,520
you'll see someone jump in to say show

975
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:10,040
me one thing she's said that's

976
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:12,960
transphobic for example here's someone

977
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:15,079
on Twitter called large gameit producer

978
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:17,319
it's funny isn't it how these people

979
00:41:15,079 --> 00:41:20,079
will insist that awkward inclusive

980
00:41:17,319 --> 00:41:22,200
language like people who menstruate is

981
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:23,520
horribly oppressive and degrading but

982
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:27,079
then they'll just straight up call

983
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:29,520
themselves large gam producer which by

984
00:41:27,079 --> 00:41:32,440
the way is Ring's definition of a woman

985
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:34,760
the woman is um the producer of the

986
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:36,560
large gamits oh I like it it's very

987
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:38,319
brood mother that Rowling's words

988
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:40,599
regularly appear in gender critical

989
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:42,839
arguments shows the massive influence

990
00:41:40,599 --> 00:41:44,800
that she has in the anti-trans movement

991
00:41:42,839 --> 00:41:46,560
she's like their Queen they their their

992
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:47,800
leader their their head mistress she's

993
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:49,839
the best thing that ever happened to

994
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:51,560
them cuz Sheila Jeff certainly wasn't

995
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:54,920
persuading a lot of people if you know

996
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:58,480
you know large gamet producer says JK

997
00:41:54,920 --> 00:42:00,440
isn't anti-trans give me just one direct

998
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:03,520
quote that she has said which is

999
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:07,200
anti-trans oh what's that you can't find

1000
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:08,839
one well Color Me shocked imagine before

1001
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:11,400
we waste our time trying to provide

1002
00:42:08,839 --> 00:42:14,280
examples let's take a look at large gam

1003
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:17,319
producers profile trans women are not

1004
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:19,880
women they are men trans men are not men

1005
00:42:17,319 --> 00:42:21,200
they are women nothing can change that

1006
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:23,760
sex is

1007
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:26,200
binary like if this person doesn't think

1008
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:28,920
that trans women are men trans men are

1009
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:30,640
women is a transphobic statement then

1010
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:32,559
what would they consider a transphobic

1011
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:35,119
statement this is why the first question

1012
00:42:32,559 --> 00:42:36,960
you should always ask such people is do

1013
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:38,960
you believe that transphobia is a

1014
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:40,720
legitimate concept what are some

1015
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:42,760
examples of statements that you would

1016
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:44,920
consider transphobic because many of

1017
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:46,839
them don't believe that transphobia is a

1018
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:48,599
valid concept because they don't think

1019
00:42:46,839 --> 00:42:50,319
that trans people are a legitimate

1020
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:52,599
minority there's no such thing as a

1021
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:54,280
transom there's no such thing as a trans

1022
00:42:52,599 --> 00:42:56,800
person there is no such thing there are

1023
00:42:54,280 --> 00:43:00,119
people that call themselves these things

1024
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:01,599
that may have other issues manifesting

1025
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:03,920
that then make them think they're this

1026
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:05,880
but no we have to stop using any words

1027
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:07,599
like transgender there may be more words

1028
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:09,920
that we have to say in order to say that

1029
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:11,720
we may call it transgender ideology uh

1030
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:14,119
but when it comes to a person they may

1031
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:16,000
be following transgender ideology but

1032
00:43:14,119 --> 00:43:18,359
they are not transgender there is no

1033
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:20,440
such thing as a man or a woman being

1034
00:43:18,359 --> 00:43:22,760
anything other than a man or a woman so

1035
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:24,880
when they say show me an example of

1036
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:27,240
something transphobic JK Rowling has

1037
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:28,760
said this is a trap they're just mess

1038
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:30,240
ING with you there's nothing that she

1039
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:32,240
could have said that they would

1040
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:34,040
acknowledge as transphobic now if you're

1041
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:36,040
someone who believes that transphobia is

1042
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:38,200
a valid concept and you believe that

1043
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:40,359
trans people are a legitimate minority

1044
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:42,480
but you just genuinely are unaware of

1045
00:43:40,359 --> 00:43:44,640
what JK Rowling has said on the topic

1046
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:47,200
then I will refer you to my past video

1047
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:49,200
on JK Ring's transphobia rather than

1048
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:51,240
recapping it all here just keep in mind

1049
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:53,200
that she's gotten significantly worse

1050
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:55,440
since I made that video I mean just look

1051
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:57,520
at her Twitter feed true she never says

1052
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:59,440
the phrase I hate trans people people

1053
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:01,720
because she's not a complete idiot but

1054
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:04,680
Anita Bryant never said I hate gay

1055
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:06,599
people she said save our children I love

1056
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:08,720
her with sexual for that matter I'm

1057
00:44:06,599 --> 00:44:11,119
pretty sure David Duke doesn't say I

1058
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:14,160
hate black people but he will share a

1059
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:16,160
lot of statistics about anti-white crime

1060
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:19,040
so this is not really a very good

1061
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:21,880
Criterion for deciding who's a bigot is

1062
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:24,280
it what JK ring does do is tweet again

1063
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:26,280
and again about transgender rapists

1064
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:28,319
about the danger trans women posed to

1065
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:30,240
CIS women she implies that trans

1066
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:33,319
inclusive language is equivalent to the

1067
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:35,880
dystopia of Orwell's 1984 she writes at

1068
00:44:33,319 --> 00:44:38,200
length about the vague nefarious cabal

1069
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:41,240
of endocrinologists and ideologues that

1070
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:43,880
is supposedly persuading confused

1071
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:45,960
vulnerable girls to transition to quote

1072
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:48,280
Washington Post opinion writer Monica

1073
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:50,640
hes I do not know what is in Ring's

1074
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:53,000
heart but reading her Twitter feed this

1075
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:55,359
is the overall effect her Twitter feed

1076
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:59,920
does not ask its readers to think it

1077
00:44:55,359 --> 00:45:04,559
asks them to fear it creates phobias of

1078
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:07,040
trans people it creates trans

1079
00:45:04,559 --> 00:45:09,200
phobias if you will Rowling has also

1080
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:11,800
attacked protr politician Nicholas

1081
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:14,240
sturgeon calling her destroyer of

1082
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:17,119
women's rights via a t-shirt she got

1083
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:18,599
from anti-trans heat Monger posie Parker

1084
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:20,720
there's no such thing as a transom

1085
00:45:18,599 --> 00:45:22,480
there's no such thing as a trans person

1086
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:24,319
there is no such thing if there's one

1087
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:26,640
thing that I want people to understand

1088
00:45:24,319 --> 00:45:28,680
about Rowling's transphobia it's that

1089
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:30,800
this is is not a casee of someone

1090
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:32,880
posting a couple insensitive tweets that

1091
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:35,760
got blown out of proportion Rowling is

1092
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:38,079
an extremely outspoken opponent of trans

1093
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:40,640
rights this has been her main issue for

1094
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:43,760
several years now and because she's so

1095
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:46,319
famous she's become the de facto Global

1096
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:49,000
champion of backlash to trans rights

1097
00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:51,319
truly the Anita Bryant of transphobia

1098
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:53,599
except worse because she's way more

1099
00:45:51,319 --> 00:45:56,200
famous and way more liked than Anita

1100
00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:58,559
Bryant ever was Rowling has also praised

1101
00:45:56,200 --> 00:46:00,680
self-described Theocratic fascist Matt

1102
00:45:58,559 --> 00:46:03,400
Walsh for his transphobic propaganda

1103
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:06,720
film she refers to trans women as trans

1104
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:07,920
identified males known as Tims among

1105
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:10,119
people for whom this has become an

1106
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:11,960
unhealthy Obsession she retweets images

1107
00:46:10,119 --> 00:46:14,000
of the trans colors being erased from

1108
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:15,920
the progress flag also the colors

1109
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:18,680
representing queer people of color so

1110
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:20,480
you know great love that often roling

1111
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:22,520
pretends that she's being transphobic

1112
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:24,960
for the principled and Valiant purpose

1113
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:27,079
of Defending lesbians it's something of

1114
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:29,319
a fixation for her I find this

1115
00:46:27,079 --> 00:46:31,920
particularly gross because it plays into

1116
00:46:29,319 --> 00:46:34,359
the lesbophobic Trope that gay women are

1117
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:36,079
especially anti-trans when in fact

1118
00:46:34,359 --> 00:46:38,280
they're the least transphobic

1119
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:40,359
demographic of CIS people according to a

1120
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:42,240
survey of young adults in the UK

1121
00:46:40,359 --> 00:46:45,559
lesbians were most likely to know a

1122
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:48,280
trans person and also most likely at

1123
00:46:45,559 --> 00:46:50,440
96% to say that they're supportive or

1124
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:52,880
very supportive of trans people so I

1125
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:55,920
think it's fair to say that most gay

1126
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:58,960
women are probably not super thrilled

1127
00:46:55,920 --> 00:47:02,040
whenever Joe the lesbian Defender logs

1128
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:04,160
on my own partner is a CIS lesbian and I

1129
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:06,640
asked her if she enjoys JK rolling

1130
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:08,760
defending her from the transexuals and

1131
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:12,000
she said it makes me want to gouge out

1132
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:14,040
my eyes like edus by the way here is JK

1133
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:16,839
Rowling enjoying a bit of banter with

1134
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:19,319
her friend baroness Emma Nicholson the

1135
00:47:16,839 --> 00:47:21,040
co-founder of Rowling's charity lumos

1136
00:47:19,319 --> 00:47:23,240
baroness Nicholson is a conservative

1137
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:26,079
member of the House of Lords who voted

1138
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:28,880
against same-sex marriage in 2013 in

1139
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:31,319
2020 she tweeted in defense of her vote

1140
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:34,200
claiming that gay marriage would lead to

1141
00:47:31,319 --> 00:47:37,200
degrading the status of women and girls

1142
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:40,400
truly one of the great lesbian allies

1143
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:42,720
and in 2022 here is JK Rowling joking

1144
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:45,359
around with Lady Nicholson excellent

1145
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:48,160
question Emma defining lesbians as

1146
00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:50,559
same-sex attracted women excludes and

1147
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:53,400
depresses the most marginalized of all

1148
00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:56,000
groups I.E people with penises and

1149
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:58,760
beards who want to Shag women and before

1150
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:02,520
you say but aren't they straight men

1151
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:04,640
they're wearing eyeliner bigot try for a

1152
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:07,079
moment to put aside any Nostalgia you

1153
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:08,839
may have for the Gryffindor common room

1154
00:48:07,079 --> 00:48:11,280
and just look at this interaction for

1155
00:48:08,839 --> 00:48:14,160
what it is two straight women one of

1156
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:16,119
whom is a homophobic peer of the realm

1157
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:18,280
having a nice little chuckle together

1158
00:48:16,119 --> 00:48:22,680
about how trans women are men wearing

1159
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:27,040
eyeliner so that's it right it's

1160
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:27,040
over case closed

1161
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:31,559
I still like hammering

1162
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:34,400
things I'm not going to argue anymore

1163
00:48:31,559 --> 00:48:36,040
about whether JK Rowling is transphobic

1164
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:38,920
because anyone who believes in

1165
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:41,200
transphobia can see that obviously she

1166
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:43,480
is the question now is whether

1167
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:45,920
transphobia is the sort of thing that

1168
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:49,040
progressives can denounce the way we at

1169
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:51,200
least aspire to denounce racism misogyny

1170
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:53,040
and homophobia that's usually what we're

1171
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:55,720
talking about when we talk about JK

1172
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:58,319
rolling right whether it's fair to

1173
00:48:55,720 --> 00:49:01,000
cancel her that's what the Witch Trials

1174
00:48:58,319 --> 00:49:03,920
of JK rolling is about the rolling

1175
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:06,720
debate is a proxy for a larger question

1176
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:08,960
is transphobia a legitimate Viewpoint

1177
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:12,359
worthy of polite consideration and

1178
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:14,400
respect in Liberal Humane Society or is

1179
00:49:12,359 --> 00:49:17,040
it just an ugly Prejudice that we can

1180
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:19,240
justifiably react to with scorn and

1181
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:21,040
condemnation and there's an even broader

1182
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:24,160
question here about whether we can

1183
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:27,040
justifiably react to anything with scorn

1184
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:30,280
and condemnation is cancelling ever

1185
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:33,200
warranted is it right to condemn racism

1186
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:35,760
homophobia and misogyny or should we

1187
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:37,720
allow spokespeople for these prejudices

1188
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:40,079
a respected position in the free

1189
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:42,680
marketpl of ideas where we can all sit

1190
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:44,920
around debating the legitimacy of gay

1191
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:47,559
marriage or the possible merits of a

1192
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:50,040
white ethn state is the final solution a

1193
00:49:47,559 --> 00:49:53,559
myth promulgated by the international

1194
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:56,160
Jew are yoga pants to blame for sexual

1195
00:49:53,559 --> 00:49:57,240
violence wouldn't the taxpayer save a

1196
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:59,760
lot of money

1197
00:49:57,240 --> 00:50:02,599
if there weren't so many disabled people

1198
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:05,200
who knows these are open questions let's

1199
00:50:02,599 --> 00:50:07,960
sit down with people on both sides on

1200
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:09,640
many sides and have calm civil

1201
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:15,079
conversations about it for the rest of

1202
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:18,119
our goddamn lives chapter 5

1203
00:50:15,079 --> 00:50:20,160
debate Sor I know I did this look before

1204
00:50:18,119 --> 00:50:22,480
and it's like not related to the video

1205
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:26,319
Topic at all but it just makes me feel

1206
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:28,760
sliving the boy who sved so Megan Phelps

1207
00:50:26,319 --> 00:50:31,200
r Viewpoint seems to be that scorn and

1208
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:33,160
condemnation are never appropriate that

1209
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:35,400
we should approach every conflict with

1210
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:38,440
empathy and compassion even when dealing

1211
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:41,760
with the worst most destructive people

1212
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:43,920
in the world hi my name is Megan and my

1213
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:46,359
heretical belief is that even the people

1214
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:48,280
who seem to be the worst most

1215
00:50:46,359 --> 00:50:50,720
destructive people in the world are

1216
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:52,640
human beings who deserve compassion and

1217
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:54,799
empathy if we want to find a way to

1218
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:57,640
change their minds in her book in her

1219
00:50:54,799 --> 00:51:00,559
Ted Talk in her public opin appearances

1220
00:50:57,640 --> 00:51:03,240
Megan expresses the idea that Society

1221
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:06,520
has recently become polarized in some

1222
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:09,599
unprecedented way that we've all become

1223
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:13,000
extremists that in some sense we've all

1224
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:15,040
become the westbo Baptist Church I can't

1225
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:17,240
help but see in our public discourse so

1226
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:19,040
many of the same destructive impulses

1227
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:21,280
that ruled my former Church she

1228
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:24,119
identifies things like certainty

1229
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:26,920
vilification of compromise US versus

1230
00:51:24,119 --> 00:51:29,680
them thinking suppression of empathy and

1231
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:31,960
celebration of death and Misfortune as

1232
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:34,799
Westboro like elements in public

1233
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:37,480
discourse and this really bothers Megan

1234
00:51:34,799 --> 00:51:39,200
because she claims that a decade ago

1235
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:42,359
when she went on Twitter to tweet about

1236
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:45,119
how marriage is abominable to God it was

1237
00:51:42,359 --> 00:51:47,880
people who engaged her in a civil

1238
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:50,720
rational way that eventually led her to

1239
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:53,280
renouncing West bro's ideology and like

1240
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:55,480
I don't entirely disagree with Megan

1241
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:57,599
about this she's totally right that if

1242
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:59,240
you want to change people's Minds then

1243
00:51:57,599 --> 00:52:02,319
approaching them with compassion and

1244
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:04,000
empathy is usually the best way to do

1245
00:52:02,319 --> 00:52:06,400
that but Megan reaches another

1246
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:08,839
conclusion that I don't agree with which

1247
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:11,240
is that because compassion and civil

1248
00:52:08,839 --> 00:52:14,640
conversation are most likely to persuade

1249
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:17,240
people we should never cancel anyone

1250
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:19,440
even the most horrible bigots and

1251
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:21,680
cancelling is a pretty meaningless term

1252
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:23,880
at this point but when Megan means is we

1253
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:26,520
shouldn't say mean things to bigots we

1254
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:29,480
shouldn't boycott or counter-protest or

1255
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:32,240
or raise our voices we shouldn't shun or

1256
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:34,960
exclude anyone because that's just not

1257
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:37,760
how you change minds and I get why Megan

1258
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:39,559
thinks this right deradicalization was a

1259
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:41,599
really important part of her life

1260
00:52:39,559 --> 00:52:43,160
experience she's also clearly holding

1261
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:44,920
out hope that other members of her

1262
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:46,960
family will leave Westboro and have a

1263
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:48,920
life on the outside she has a quote from

1264
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:50,960
her mom in her Twitter bio the last

1265
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:52,880
lines of her book address her family I

1266
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:55,240
want to tell them that I love them I'll

1267
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:58,400
just have to find another way this is

1268
00:52:55,240 --> 00:53:00,760
touching and human and also kind of a

1269
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:03,480
conflict of interest the problem is

1270
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:05,839
Megan's views about this only make sense

1271
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:08,160
if you assume that Megan is the main

1272
00:53:05,839 --> 00:53:11,040
character of reality if you assume that

1273
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:12,760
the moral Improvement of bigots is more

1274
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:14,839
important than protecting the people

1275
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:17,160
they target or if you assume that

1276
00:53:14,839 --> 00:53:20,040
changing bigots Minds is the only way to

1277
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:22,839
make social progress which it isn't as

1278
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:25,960
far as I know Anita Bryant is 83 years

1279
00:53:22,839 --> 00:53:28,760
old and she's still homophobic but even

1280
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:31,359
without his Blessing gay rights have

1281
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:34,599
still somehow managed to progress since

1282
00:53:31,359 --> 00:53:36,920
the 1970s because gay activists didn't

1283
00:53:34,599 --> 00:53:39,520
need to persuade Anita Bryant they

1284
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:41,760
needed to defeat her and that's what

1285
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:44,680
they did we have to accept that

1286
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:47,119
realistically persuading all the bigots

1287
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:49,720
is just not an option yes we should

1288
00:53:47,119 --> 00:53:52,440
convince as many people as possible but

1289
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:55,640
there will always be bigots and mocking

1290
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:58,160
them shaming them or boycotting them is

1291
00:53:55,640 --> 00:54:00,760
I think a perfect ly valid strategy does

1292
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:03,559
that mean that when we cancel bigots

1293
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:06,599
we're acting kind of like the westbo

1294
00:54:03,559 --> 00:54:09,200
Baptist Church n you would only think

1295
00:54:06,599 --> 00:54:11,359
that if you're a total moral relativist

1296
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:14,040
I guess controversial opinion but

1297
00:54:11,359 --> 00:54:16,280
bigotry is shameful and it should be

1298
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:18,559
shamed I'll say it you know if you're

1299
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:21,240
testing out some racist ideas in your

1300
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:23,839
head you might feel afraid to express

1301
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:26,760
them publicly for fear of being shamed

1302
00:54:23,839 --> 00:54:29,480
or judged is that because we live in an

1303
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:32,640
orwellian dystopia that punishes people

1304
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:35,040
for wrong think no it's because racism

1305
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:37,079
is dangerous and shameful and you should

1306
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:39,240
be ashamed of it and the people judging

1307
00:54:37,079 --> 00:54:41,880
you are right to do so and sure there

1308
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:44,440
are some very patient people who devote

1309
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:46,839
their lives to Der radicalizing bigots

1310
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:49,280
which I think is a perfectly Noble thing

1311
00:54:46,839 --> 00:54:51,359
to do there's a guy named Daryl Davis

1312
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:54,079
who's befriended members of the Klux

1313
00:54:51,359 --> 00:54:56,440
clan for over 30 years and he claims

1314
00:54:54,079 --> 00:54:59,559
he's convinced more than 200 of them to

1315
00:54:56,440 --> 00:55:02,599
leave and good for him deradicalization

1316
00:54:59,559 --> 00:55:05,559
is a valid strategy but it cannot be the

1317
00:55:02,599 --> 00:55:07,599
only strategy and it must not be the

1318
00:55:05,559 --> 00:55:10,359
primary strategy because we're not going

1319
00:55:07,599 --> 00:55:12,839
to defeat racism by telling black people

1320
00:55:10,359 --> 00:55:15,079
to be a little nicer to racists

1321
00:55:12,839 --> 00:55:17,000
feminists would be wasting their time

1322
00:55:15,079 --> 00:55:19,359
trying to convince Andrew Tate to

1323
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:21,520
respect women in general I think that

1324
00:55:19,359 --> 00:55:24,440
the massive effort that it takes to

1325
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:27,079
maybe persuade bigots is better spent

1326
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:29,520
persuading other people not to listen to

1327
00:55:27,079 --> 00:55:32,039
them and it's also worth cautioning that

1328
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:34,720
deradicalization is often a messy and

1329
00:55:32,039 --> 00:55:37,319
incomplete process 20-year-old white

1330
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:39,359
nationalist Peter saitan ofic became the

1331
00:55:37,319 --> 00:55:43,200
face of the fascist unite the right

1332
00:55:39,359 --> 00:55:46,599
rally in 2017 when a photo of him midc

1333
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:48,960
scream TIY torch in hand was published

1334
00:55:46,599 --> 00:55:51,400
in news outlets all over the country

1335
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:53,880
Peter was unrepentant in interviews he

1336
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:56,359
gave immediately after the rally but he

1337
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:58,960
began to question his beliefs after

1338
00:55:56,359 --> 00:56:01,599
befriending a Muslim woman who according

1339
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:04,160
to Charlotte McDonald Gibson challenged

1340
00:56:01,599 --> 00:56:07,039
his views without insulting him allowing

1341
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:09,359
him to understand the hurt he had caused

1342
00:56:07,039 --> 00:56:11,400
Peter is no longer a white nationalist

1343
00:56:09,359 --> 00:56:14,000
but that doesn't mean he's flushed out

1344
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:15,520
every trace of bigotry in a 2019

1345
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:18,359
interview with the London School of

1346
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:20,280
Economics student paper Peter said I

1347
00:56:18,359 --> 00:56:23,039
don't like the whole transgender thing

1348
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:25,559
you're born either a man or a woman so

1349
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:28,119
he maybe still has a little bit of work

1350
00:56:25,559 --> 00:56:30,839
to do when I did deradicalization work

1351
00:56:28,119 --> 00:56:32,839
on YouTube I used to get some criticism

1352
00:56:30,839 --> 00:56:34,880
from people of color who were not

1353
00:56:32,839 --> 00:56:37,760
thrilled that I was bringing a bunch of

1354
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:40,200
semi- reformed racists over to the left

1355
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:43,200
a frustration that I totally understand

1356
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:45,640
to paraphrase YouTuber Ian dankin

1357
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:48,000
diverse leftist communities are maybe

1358
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:50,559
not the best holding space for someone

1359
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:52,839
who's a bit of a Nazi but working on it

1360
00:56:50,559 --> 00:56:54,880
in the case of Megan Phelps Roper I

1361
00:56:52,839 --> 00:56:57,240
don't know if she has lingering bigoted

1362
00:56:54,880 --> 00:57:00,039
sentiments but what she does have is a

1363
00:56:57,240 --> 00:57:03,319
kind of hypervigilant skepticism about

1364
00:57:00,039 --> 00:57:05,200
anything she perceives as ideology this

1365
00:57:03,319 --> 00:57:07,520
is pretty common with people who used to

1366
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:09,720
be religious fundamentalists they were

1367
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:11,720
so certain they were right only to

1368
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:14,240
realize that everything they believed

1369
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:16,440
about the world is wrong so they become

1370
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:18,920
distrustful of any strong moral

1371
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:21,039
convictions because it reminds them of

1372
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:23,799
their former fanaticism coming from

1373
00:57:21,039 --> 00:57:25,880
westbo where I believed so strongly that

1374
00:57:23,799 --> 00:57:27,880
I was doing the right thing and then

1375
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:29,760
tell believe and come to believe that it

1376
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:33,440
was so destructive and

1377
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:36,920
harmful I had this this moment in time

1378
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:38,920
and it lasted for for many months where

1379
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:41,280
I was like how can I ever trust my own

1380
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:44,079
mind again this kind of skepticism is in

1381
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:46,559
some ways a good impulse but valuing

1382
00:57:44,079 --> 00:57:49,720
dispassionate intellectualism above all

1383
00:57:46,559 --> 00:57:52,240
else can cause problems especially where

1384
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:54,039
topics of social justice are concerned

1385
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:57,000
because it can lead you to this kind of

1386
00:57:54,039 --> 00:58:00,520
toxic centrism that asks why are

1387
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:03,359
marginalized people so unwilling to have

1388
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:05,880
calm philosophical debates about whether

1389
00:58:03,359 --> 00:58:09,079
they should have rights are they afraid

1390
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:11,960
of dangerous ideas atheist philosopher

1391
00:58:09,079 --> 00:58:13,680
Sam Harris in his podcast about Megan's

1392
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:15,920
podcast can we talk about how there are

1393
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:18,640
too many podcasts I'm calling for a

1394
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:20,799
complete and total shutdown of podcasts

1395
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:23,760
until we can figure out what's going on

1396
00:58:20,799 --> 00:58:26,720
Sam Harris in his podcast about Megan's

1397
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:29,839
podcast complained that transactive ISM

1398
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:33,200
and activism in general is plagued by

1399
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:36,520
mental illness and hysteria I frankly

1400
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:38,920
think there there's a fair degree of of

1401
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:42,640
mental instability and and even Frank

1402
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:45,079
mental illness in the activist Community

1403
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:49,119
I mean in in in really in all activist

1404
00:58:45,079 --> 00:58:51,760
communities the level of viciousness and

1405
00:58:49,119 --> 00:58:54,200
hysteria is um you know it's hard to

1406
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:57,240
know what to compare it to diversity

1407
00:58:54,200 --> 00:59:00,240
when man accuses trans women of being

1408
00:58:57,240 --> 00:59:02,480
hysterical is it really hysteria to

1409
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:05,119
react with strong emotions when your

1410
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:07,359
basic inclusion in society is Up For

1411
00:59:05,119 --> 00:59:09,680
Debate aren't there certain situations

1412
00:59:07,359 --> 00:59:11,799
where strong emotions are warranted it

1413
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:14,720
reminds me of this awful episode of Joe

1414
00:59:11,799 --> 00:59:17,039
Rogan feat Ben Shapiro where Lil Benny

1415
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:20,079
argues that gay marriage is immoral with

1416
00:59:17,039 --> 00:59:22,520
his usual whining sophistry and Joe

1417
00:59:20,079 --> 00:59:26,119
gently raises objections for Ben to talk

1418
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:27,960
circles around the human sex drive was

1419
00:59:26,119 --> 00:59:30,520
made to procreate within a stable

1420
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:32,640
relationship in order to progenerate and

1421
00:59:30,520 --> 00:59:34,319
have future generations of people misuse

1422
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:36,599
of that sex drive in any way whether

1423
00:59:34,319 --> 00:59:39,079
you're talking about from masturbation

1424
00:59:36,599 --> 00:59:40,920
to homosexual activity is therefore a

1425
00:59:39,079 --> 00:59:42,559
diminishment of the use of that drive

1426
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:44,640
that's the natural law case against

1427
00:59:42,559 --> 00:59:47,599
against homosexual activity all of the

1428
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:49,280
top comments on this video are like this

1429
00:59:47,599 --> 00:59:50,520
imagine talking about different beliefs

1430
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:52,280
while still having a productive

1431
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:54,119
conversation things progress when you

1432
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:55,640
don't demonize people the discussion

1433
00:59:54,119 --> 00:59:57,799
here was excellent two guys with

1434
00:59:55,640 --> 00:59:59,839
opposing opinions speaking calmly and

1435
00:59:57,799 --> 01:00:01,680
intellectually without cursing shouting

1436
00:59:59,839 --> 01:00:04,200
and making disparaging comments about

1437
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:05,960
each other this is how it should be done

1438
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:07,760
kudos to both of them Joe is a great

1439
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:09,559
interviewer he can totally disagree with

1440
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:11,680
someone and still have a calm Collective

1441
01:00:09,559 --> 01:00:13,520
conversation this is how it should be

1442
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:15,160
just two people sharing ideas learning

1443
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:16,559
different point of views from each other

1444
01:00:15,160 --> 01:00:18,680
this is why Joe is the number one

1445
01:00:16,559 --> 01:00:21,119
podcast Joe Rogan beautifully asked the

1446
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:23,160
tough questions and Ben answers honestly

1447
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:25,039
he is strong in his faith I love this

1448
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:27,400
debate because it's two so contrasting

1449
01:00:25,039 --> 01:00:30,000
views and they have a conversation great

1450
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:32,559
learning and like yeah it's easy for two

1451
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:34,520
straight men to have a dispassionate

1452
01:00:32,559 --> 01:00:37,319
theoretical conversation about the

1453
01:00:34,520 --> 01:00:39,960
ethics of homosexuality because it's not

1454
01:00:37,319 --> 01:00:42,480
their lives and their relationships that

1455
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:44,559
are up for debate these people don't

1456
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:47,039
understand the emotional burden placed

1457
01:00:44,559 --> 01:00:49,000
on marginalized people who are asked to

1458
01:00:47,039 --> 01:00:52,160
defend their rights like if you're

1459
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:54,760
straight do you want to publicly debate

1460
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:56,680
whether your marriage is valid Andrew

1461
01:00:54,760 --> 01:00:58,880
dworin claimed that penetrative

1462
01:00:56,680 --> 01:01:01,359
heterosexual intercourse is inherently

1463
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:03,520
an act of violence I've noticed that

1464
01:01:01,359 --> 01:01:06,520
most straight men don't want to have a

1465
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:08,520
calm civil conversation about that so

1466
01:01:06,520 --> 01:01:10,599
imagine how they'd react if there was a

1467
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:13,359
powerful political movement to

1468
01:01:10,599 --> 01:01:15,599
criminalize penetration or revoke their

1469
01:01:13,359 --> 01:01:19,079
right to marry add in a lifetime of

1470
01:01:15,599 --> 01:01:21,480
ostracism family rejection bullying and

1471
01:01:19,079 --> 01:01:24,520
discrimination and maybe then you'll

1472
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:26,760
begin to understand the hysteria of a

1473
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:29,039
lot of queer people it is is my right to

1474
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:30,799
raise my child with the moral precept

1475
01:01:29,039 --> 01:01:33,079
that I find to be beneficial for my

1476
01:01:30,799 --> 01:01:35,119
child bet work does not get to raise my

1477
01:01:33,079 --> 01:01:37,680
child and if he tries I will meet him at

1478
01:01:35,119 --> 01:01:40,200
the door with a gun that is insane wow

1479
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:42,920
Ben Shapiro threatening violence because

1480
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:45,720
he can't handle the debate sounds like a

1481
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:47,640
classic case of Hysteria to me why can't

1482
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:50,599
Ben Shapiro just have a polite

1483
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:52,920
conversation about boric transing his

1484
01:01:50,599 --> 01:01:54,599
children I now have two choices one is

1485
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:56,160
to leave the country utterly two is to

1486
01:01:54,599 --> 01:01:58,640
pick up a gun those are the only choices

1487
01:01:56,160 --> 01:02:01,319
that you have left me Dave Ruben is a

1488
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:03,359
gay conservative whose career requires

1489
01:02:01,319 --> 01:02:06,119
that he convince his right-wing audience

1490
01:02:03,359 --> 01:02:08,000
that he's one of the good ones this

1491
01:02:06,119 --> 01:02:10,960
means that he's willing to sit across

1492
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:13,920
from his so-called friend homophobe Ben

1493
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:16,200
Shapiro and listen to Ben say he would

1494
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:17,880
never attend his anniversary party

1495
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:20,039
because it would be tantamount to

1496
01:02:17,880 --> 01:02:22,520
endorsing sin there's a difference

1497
01:02:20,039 --> 01:02:25,599
between me just being friends with Dave

1498
01:02:22,520 --> 01:02:26,440
and me actively participating in an

1499
01:02:25,599 --> 01:02:28,319
event

1500
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:30,839
that I feel is religiously sinful the

1501
01:02:28,319 --> 01:02:32,799
two of them then congratulate themselves

1502
01:02:30,839 --> 01:02:35,599
about how they can still be great

1503
01:02:32,799 --> 01:02:37,680
friends why is it that we're able to do

1504
01:02:35,599 --> 01:02:39,039
this and most people can't do this

1505
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:40,960
that's what I'm curious we go home at

1506
01:02:39,039 --> 01:02:43,200
night and we can have our own lives and

1507
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:45,160
here's Dave having a civil conversation

1508
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:48,000
with conservative Glenn Beck who

1509
01:02:45,160 --> 01:02:50,960
Compares homosexuality to alcoholism and

1510
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:53,760
then congratulates himself on having the

1511
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:56,599
conversation I am a deeply religious man

1512
01:02:53,760 --> 01:03:00,200
and my religion says

1513
01:02:56,599 --> 01:03:02,520
man and a woman uh that is the basic

1514
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:08,359
building block of family and that's what

1515
01:03:02,520 --> 01:03:10,839
I believe but I also am I also I also

1516
01:03:08,359 --> 01:03:15,000
know God created you just like he

1517
01:03:10,839 --> 01:03:17,359
created me Flaws and All uh you know um

1518
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:20,400
I believe I have a gene they've never

1519
01:03:17,359 --> 01:03:22,720
found it that makes me very susceptible

1520
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:26,160
to alcoholism because it runs in my

1521
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:28,960
family so does craziness but it runs my

1522
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:30,839
family well Dave smiles and nods

1523
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:33,200
probably because he's thinking about how

1524
01:03:30,839 --> 01:03:36,640
much he enjoys the taste of

1525
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:39,279
boots usually I just take out a picture

1526
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:41,480
of me and DeSantis and then we're good

1527
01:03:39,279 --> 01:03:43,680
because they get it they get it that's

1528
01:03:41,480 --> 01:03:46,039
my Governor yeah I think a lot of

1529
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:50,160
straight people look at Dave ruin and

1530
01:03:46,039 --> 01:03:53,279
they see finally a reasonable gay person

1531
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:56,039
who doesn't scream bigot at everyone who

1532
01:03:53,279 --> 01:03:58,720
disagrees and can actually have a civil

1533
01:03:56,039 --> 01:04:02,359
conversation but that's not what I see I

1534
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:04,880
look at Dave Ruben and I see a sainless

1535
01:04:02,359 --> 01:04:07,640
boot looking doormat who won't even

1536
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:10,640
defend his own family from the most

1537
01:04:07,640 --> 01:04:13,279
fundamental disrespect I also can't help

1538
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:15,839
but notice that none of these civil

1539
01:04:13,279 --> 01:04:19,240
conversations seem to change anyone's

1540
01:04:15,839 --> 01:04:22,160
mind persuasion is more complicated and

1541
01:04:19,240 --> 01:04:24,640
less rational than people think Megan

1542
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:26,480
often says that she was deradicalized on

1543
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:28,640
Twitter but if you read read her book

1544
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:31,520
carefully you'll notice that that's not

1545
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:34,039
exactly true the major precipitating

1546
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:36,400
event for Megan's crisis of Faith was

1547
01:04:34,039 --> 01:04:38,839
her mother's mistreatment at the hands

1548
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:41,720
of an increasingly misogynistic Church

1549
01:04:38,839 --> 01:04:43,839
leadership that made Megan feel like she

1550
01:04:41,720 --> 01:04:46,119
was the victim of the church for once

1551
01:04:43,839 --> 01:04:48,760
she says of the church discipline for

1552
01:04:46,119 --> 01:04:50,559
the first time in my life the accus were

1553
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:52,720
people I lived with and knew most

1554
01:04:50,559 --> 01:04:55,000
intimately and I knew that the judgments

1555
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:57,400
leveled by the elders were wrong I could

1556
01:04:55,000 --> 01:05:00,079
no longer blindly trust the Judgment of

1557
01:04:57,400 --> 01:05:02,160
these men so she finally experienced

1558
01:05:00,079 --> 01:05:04,559
firsthand what it's like to be the

1559
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:06,599
victim of her family she stopped voting

1560
01:05:04,559 --> 01:05:09,000
for The leopards eating people's faces

1561
01:05:06,599 --> 01:05:11,920
party only when the leopards ate her

1562
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:14,079
face it also seems relevant to notice

1563
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:16,520
that the people who had calm civil

1564
01:05:14,079 --> 01:05:19,160
conversations with Megan on Twitter were

1565
01:05:16,520 --> 01:05:20,799
generally not gay people the people most

1566
01:05:19,160 --> 01:05:23,640
affected by her family's violent

1567
01:05:20,799 --> 01:05:27,240
rhetoric they're mostly straight men

1568
01:05:23,640 --> 01:05:31,640
like director Kevin Smith who started #

1569
01:05:27,240 --> 01:05:34,160
saave Megan because quote she's hot

1570
01:05:31,640 --> 01:05:36,200
there's often an neotic component to

1571
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:38,880
persuasion and that certainly seems to

1572
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:42,000
be the case with Megan because one of

1573
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:44,240
the people who helped deradicalize her

1574
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:46,200
is now her husband and I feel like

1575
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:48,119
that's IR relevant detail if we're

1576
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:50,680
trying to understand the role of reason

1577
01:05:48,119 --> 01:05:52,760
and emotion in deradicalization

1578
01:05:50,680 --> 01:05:55,640
experiences I think this experience is

1579
01:05:52,760 --> 01:05:58,520
usually more akin to religious confir

1580
01:05:55,640 --> 01:06:00,079
verion than it is to logical reasoning

1581
01:05:58,520 --> 01:06:02,760
there's also a world of difference

1582
01:06:00,079 --> 01:06:04,799
between the mostly private conversations

1583
01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:07,400
that actually lead people to reflect on

1584
01:06:04,799 --> 01:06:10,079
their beliefs and the spectacle of

1585
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:12,520
public debate Ben Shapiro is never going

1586
01:06:10,079 --> 01:06:14,920
to become less homophobic because he

1587
01:06:12,520 --> 01:06:17,520
live streamed a civil conversation with

1588
01:06:14,920 --> 01:06:20,319
Dave Ruben so who is this conversation

1589
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:23,160
even for well obviously it's for the

1590
01:06:20,319 --> 01:06:25,720
audience I think these civil

1591
01:06:23,160 --> 01:06:28,799
conversations basically function to to

1592
01:06:25,720 --> 01:06:32,400
reassure a homophobic audience that just

1593
01:06:28,799 --> 01:06:34,920
because they disagree with the lifestyle

1594
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:37,520
doesn't mean that they hate gay people

1595
01:06:34,920 --> 01:06:40,119
look at Ben Shapiro he's friends with a

1596
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:42,760
gay public debate is one way that we

1597
01:06:40,119 --> 01:06:44,839
Define the limits of the Overton window

1598
01:06:42,760 --> 01:06:47,440
the range of beliefs that is socially

1599
01:06:44,839 --> 01:06:50,520
acceptable to hold so often people who

1600
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:52,680
want to promote bigotry will use debate

1601
01:06:50,520 --> 01:06:55,000
as a foot in the door it's a way of

1602
01:06:52,680 --> 01:06:57,079
establishing that their prejudices are

1603
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:59,400
within the realm of reasonable and

1604
01:06:57,079 --> 01:07:01,720
socially accepted opinion here's

1605
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:05,079
obsessive anti-trans bigot Graham

1606
01:07:01,720 --> 01:07:08,359
linahan in a fury that a drag queen is

1607
01:07:05,079 --> 01:07:10,640
on Doctor Who without the British public

1608
01:07:08,359 --> 01:07:13,480
having a proper debate about these

1609
01:07:10,640 --> 01:07:16,200
issues now why do we need to have a

1610
01:07:13,480 --> 01:07:18,680
proper debate about whether drag queens

1611
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:21,039
should be allowed on television when

1612
01:07:18,680 --> 01:07:23,440
drag performance has been a staple of

1613
01:07:21,039 --> 01:07:25,920
British entertainment since at least the

1614
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:28,520
time of Shakespeare life is a that's

1615
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:28,520
just be

1616
01:07:29,480 --> 01:07:40,039
g fromo fishy fishy fishy fish as I am

1617
01:07:36,839 --> 01:07:43,279
man my state is desperate for my

1618
01:07:40,039 --> 01:07:46,599
Master's love As I Am

1619
01:07:43,279 --> 01:07:49,599
Woman now last the day bigots like

1620
01:07:46,599 --> 01:07:51,760
Graham want a Perpetual debate on their

1621
01:07:49,599 --> 01:07:54,200
own terms because this is how they

1622
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:56,319
dignify their Pearl clutching it's how

1623
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:59,680
they convince the public that their

1624
01:07:56,319 --> 01:08:02,559
moral Panic about drag queens on TV is

1625
01:07:59,680 --> 01:08:05,440
actually a valid concern rather than the

1626
01:08:02,559 --> 01:08:08,039
tedious small-minded whining about

1627
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:10,880
nothing that it really is having the

1628
01:08:08,039 --> 01:08:13,359
debate on a biggest terms is not a good

1629
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:15,839
way to win people over unless you're

1630
01:08:13,359 --> 01:08:18,319
really skilled in the art of humiliating

1631
01:08:15,839 --> 01:08:20,960
people which most of the time is what

1632
01:08:18,319 --> 01:08:22,920
public debate is actually about this is

1633
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:25,640
something that JK Rowling doesn't seem

1634
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:28,920
to understand in the which Trials of JK

1635
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:31,400
ruling Joo takes a contradictory stance

1636
01:08:28,920 --> 01:08:34,560
on deplatforming she brings up

1637
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:36,759
right-wing provocator Milo yannopoulos

1638
01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:40,600
saying that activists are making a

1639
01:08:36,759 --> 01:08:43,239
strategic error and giving Milo Power by

1640
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:45,880
protesting his events making him look

1641
01:08:43,239 --> 01:08:48,440
dangerous and sexy but when trans people

1642
01:08:45,880 --> 01:08:51,279
try to deplatform turfs Rand

1643
01:08:48,440 --> 01:08:53,960
characterizes this as silencing so is

1644
01:08:51,279 --> 01:08:56,199
deplatforming a strategic era that gives

1645
01:08:53,960 --> 01:08:58,560
power to your opponent or is it a

1646
01:08:56,199 --> 01:09:00,359
powerful tactic of silencing I find

1647
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:02,679
Ring's conviction that we ought to

1648
01:09:00,359 --> 01:09:05,920
debate Milo yannopoulos really out of

1649
01:09:02,679 --> 01:09:08,719
touch milonopoulos doesn't have reasons

1650
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:11,120
for the things he does he has strategies

1651
01:09:08,719 --> 01:09:12,679
for humiliating people I've taken some

1652
01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:15,239
time out of my busy schedule being

1653
01:09:12,679 --> 01:09:18,080
fabulous and doing my hair to prepare a

1654
01:09:15,239 --> 01:09:21,679
speech for you well a few remarks

1655
01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:25,120
really feminism is cancer thank you very

1656
01:09:21,679 --> 01:09:27,199
much to again quote Ian danin you can't

1657
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:29,520
really reason with someone who thinks

1658
01:09:27,199 --> 01:09:32,400
that feminism is cancer because you

1659
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:35,239
don't reason with cancer you eradicate

1660
01:09:32,400 --> 01:09:37,759
it rolling objects to the slogan no

1661
01:09:35,239 --> 01:09:39,960
debate in the strongest possible terms

1662
01:09:37,759 --> 01:09:42,440
and then we come to the famous two-word

1663
01:09:39,960 --> 01:09:45,600
slogan the stop phrase no debate no

1664
01:09:42,440 --> 01:09:49,799
debate no debate we hear it all the time

1665
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:51,719
that alarms me really alarms me I can't

1666
01:09:49,799 --> 01:09:53,799
think of a purer instance of

1667
01:09:51,719 --> 01:09:55,440
authoritarianism than no debate it's

1668
01:09:53,799 --> 01:09:57,920
kind of amazing to me that someone can

1669
01:09:55,440 --> 01:10:01,000
think angry trans people on Twitter are

1670
01:09:57,920 --> 01:10:03,520
the purest example of authoritarianism I

1671
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:05,520
truly hope that one day I am privileged

1672
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:07,760
enough to be capable of such a

1673
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:10,199
perspective before I move on I do want

1674
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:12,880
to clarify that I do think there are

1675
01:10:10,199 --> 01:10:15,280
trans issues that are legitimately

1676
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:18,159
debatable by people who are not bigots

1677
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:21,480
in my opinion trans women in women's

1678
01:10:18,159 --> 01:10:24,560
sports is one of those issues but it's a

1679
01:10:21,480 --> 01:10:26,920
complicated issue like first of all

1680
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:29,320
which sport are we talking about are we

1681
01:10:26,920 --> 01:10:32,159
talking about figure skating Middle

1682
01:10:29,320 --> 01:10:34,560
School field hockey I see no reason why

1683
01:10:32,159 --> 01:10:36,280
trans girls should be excluded from that

1684
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:38,480
but if we're talking about professional

1685
01:10:36,280 --> 01:10:40,719
weightlifting well then it seems

1686
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:43,360
plausible that trans women who have been

1687
01:10:40,719 --> 01:10:46,000
through male puberty may still retain

1688
01:10:43,360 --> 01:10:48,199
some kind of group Advantage but not all

1689
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:50,920
trans women have experienced male

1690
01:10:48,199 --> 01:10:52,800
puberty people are transitioning younger

1691
01:10:50,920 --> 01:10:55,640
now and that's another thing you have to

1692
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:57,960
consider so I'm not against debating

1693
01:10:55,640 --> 01:11:00,520
this issue I just want people to

1694
01:10:57,960 --> 01:11:02,760
approach it with nuance and good faith

1695
01:11:00,520 --> 01:11:05,159
and currently a lot of the people who

1696
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:08,480
are vocally against trans women in

1697
01:11:05,159 --> 01:11:13,480
women's sports sound like this and we

1698
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:16,760
will keep men out of women's sports

1699
01:11:13,480 --> 01:11:16,760
right how

1700
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:21,920
ridiculous that will take place on day

1701
01:11:20,239 --> 01:11:23,960
one and I don't want to debate those

1702
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:28,679
people I want to serve them a banana

1703
01:11:23,960 --> 01:11:31,560
cream pie chapter 6 illiberal

1704
01:11:28,679 --> 01:11:33,560
methods one of JK Ring's core complaints

1705
01:11:31,560 --> 01:11:36,800
about the trans Rights Movement is she

1706
01:11:33,560 --> 01:11:39,199
sees it as illiberal in its methods so

1707
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:42,440
when I first became interested and then

1708
01:11:39,199 --> 01:11:45,480
deeply troubled by what I saw as a

1709
01:11:42,440 --> 01:11:48,280
cultural movement that was illiberal in

1710
01:11:45,480 --> 01:11:52,880
its methods so what are these illiberal

1711
01:11:48,280 --> 01:11:55,320
methods if you are saying this person is

1712
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:58,760
cancelled that is the language of a dict

1713
01:11:55,320 --> 01:12:00,880
T it's true cancel culture is exactly

1714
01:11:58,760 --> 01:12:03,199
how the Third Reich started first they

1715
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:05,320
canceled the Socialists and I did not

1716
01:12:03,199 --> 01:12:07,400
speak out because the hashtag was

1717
01:12:05,320 --> 01:12:10,440
trending but maybe we should see what an

1718
01:12:07,400 --> 01:12:10,440
actual dictator

1719
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:28,280
thinks you know can't help but wonder

1720
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:30,760
what counts as acceptable activist

1721
01:12:28,280 --> 01:12:33,480
methods to an author for whom Hermione

1722
01:12:30,760 --> 01:12:37,040
protesting slavery was taking things too

1723
01:12:33,480 --> 01:12:40,360
far I am fighting what I see as a

1724
01:12:37,040 --> 01:12:43,679
powerful Insidious misogynistic movement

1725
01:12:40,360 --> 01:12:46,360
I do not see this particular movement as

1726
01:12:43,679 --> 01:12:48,320
either benign or powerless ring seems to

1727
01:12:46,360 --> 01:12:50,719
think that the trans Rights Movement is

1728
01:12:48,320 --> 01:12:52,760
dangerous and authoritarian in some

1729
01:12:50,719 --> 01:12:54,560
unprecedented way that makes it

1730
01:12:52,760 --> 01:12:57,080
different from all past Liberation

1731
01:12:54,560 --> 01:12:59,600
movements but how what are these

1732
01:12:57,080 --> 01:13:01,480
illiberal methods that distinguish trans

1733
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:04,480
rights activism from similar past

1734
01:13:01,480 --> 01:13:06,639
movements cancelling Anita Bryant was

1735
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:09,280
way more cancelled than JK Rowling ever

1736
01:13:06,639 --> 01:13:11,159
will be boycotts boycotts have been a

1737
01:13:09,280 --> 01:13:13,560
staple of every progressive movement in

1738
01:13:11,159 --> 01:13:15,840
modern history disrupting feminist

1739
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:17,679
meetings disrupting feminist meetings is

1740
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:20,719
a feminist tradition haven't you heard

1741
01:13:17,679 --> 01:13:23,080
of the lavender Menace in 1969 Betty

1742
01:13:20,719 --> 01:13:24,679
fedan author of The Feminine Mystique

1743
01:13:23,080 --> 01:13:26,840
and founder of the National Organization

1744
01:13:24,679 --> 01:13:29,120
for Women women and second wve feminism

1745
01:13:26,840 --> 01:13:31,199
in general coined the phrase lavender

1746
01:13:29,120 --> 01:13:33,199
menace to describe the threat she

1747
01:13:31,199 --> 01:13:35,679
believed that lesbians posed to the

1748
01:13:33,199 --> 01:13:37,800
women's movement fedan was worried that

1749
01:13:35,679 --> 01:13:39,639
being associated with lesbians would

1750
01:13:37,800 --> 01:13:42,199
make it easy to dismiss the movement as

1751
01:13:39,639 --> 01:13:43,679
a bunch of Manish manats this

1752
01:13:42,199 --> 01:13:45,560
understandably pissed off a bunch of

1753
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:48,840
lesbians who attended the second

1754
01:13:45,560 --> 01:13:51,000
Congress to unite women in 1970 to Stage

1755
01:13:48,840 --> 01:13:53,280
what used to be known as a zap a

1756
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:55,800
disruptive public protest designed to

1757
01:13:53,280 --> 01:13:58,000
draw attention to gay rights issu think

1758
01:13:55,800 --> 01:14:00,080
glitter bombing think pies half

1759
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:02,120
aggression half Whimsy like that time

1760
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:04,080
the lesbian Avengers Zapped Rowling's

1761
01:14:02,120 --> 01:14:06,120
friend baroness Nicholson's house

1762
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:08,239
demanding that she resign this podcast

1763
01:14:06,120 --> 01:14:10,480
has pushed me over the edge centrism has

1764
01:14:08,239 --> 01:14:12,239
gone too far and I am now Pro cancel

1765
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:14,800
culture so just as the meeting was

1766
01:14:12,239 --> 01:14:17,120
beginning a group of 17 lesbians wearing

1767
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:19,400
lavender Menace t-shirts Switched Off

1768
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:21,560
the Lights pulled the plug on the mic

1769
01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:23,760
and charged down the aisles laughing and

1770
01:14:21,560 --> 01:14:25,960
screaming their leader Rita May Brown

1771
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:27,960
took the mic and yelled this conference

1772
01:14:25,960 --> 01:14:29,920
won't proceed until we talk about

1773
01:14:27,960 --> 01:14:32,400
lesbians and the women's movement one of

1774
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:34,159
the now organizers yelled back I object

1775
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:37,159
to your coming in and taking over this

1776
01:14:34,159 --> 01:14:38,960
meeting you're acting like men Betty fan

1777
01:14:37,159 --> 01:14:41,440
would later speculate that the lesbians

1778
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:43,360
were a CIA scop designed to make the

1779
01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:45,320
women's movement look bad so the

1780
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:48,080
lavender Menace disrupted the feminist

1781
01:14:45,320 --> 01:14:50,159
meeting using illiberal tactics not

1782
01:14:48,080 --> 01:14:52,280
because they were against feminism but

1783
01:14:50,159 --> 01:14:54,480
because they wanted lesbian exclusionary

1784
01:14:52,280 --> 01:14:55,679
feminists to include them it's the same

1785
01:14:54,480 --> 01:14:57,679
thing that's happened happening today

1786
01:14:55,679 --> 01:15:00,000
when trans people disrupt feminist

1787
01:14:57,679 --> 01:15:01,800
meetings as JK Rowling puts it

1788
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:04,040
interestingly neglecting to mention

1789
01:15:01,800 --> 01:15:06,320
which feminist meetings these are I was

1790
01:15:04,040 --> 01:15:08,000
starting to see activists behaving in a

1791
01:15:06,320 --> 01:15:10,320
very aggressive way outside feminist

1792
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:11,960
meetings there was a feminist meeting in

1793
01:15:10,320 --> 01:15:14,639
which they were uh banging and kicking

1794
01:15:11,960 --> 01:15:16,880
on Windows very threatening there's a

1795
01:15:14,639 --> 01:15:19,360
historical obliviousness to Rowling's

1796
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:21,520
idea that trans activists are somehow

1797
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:23,199
more aggressive than similar past

1798
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:25,440
movements like she retweeted a

1799
01:15:23,199 --> 01:15:27,760
transphobic gay man called Dennis n

1800
01:15:25,440 --> 01:15:30,120
Kavanaugh who says all those gay rights

1801
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:32,760
and AIDS protests I don't remember a

1802
01:15:30,120 --> 01:15:37,560
single one where we intimidated or

1803
01:15:32,760 --> 01:15:43,600
silenced a woman not a single one not a

1804
01:15:37,560 --> 01:15:45,280
single one not a single one not a

1805
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:48,000
single

1806
01:15:45,280 --> 01:15:50,960
one Dennis has also tweeted that he

1807
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:55,080
preferred aids to the trans movement and

1808
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:57,360

01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:23,800
threatening to nail people to a wall

1818
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:25,760
count as illiberal methods I guess JK

1819
01:16:23,800 --> 01:16:27,960
ring doesn't think so because she's

1820
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:30,040
never condemned it in fact when Dennis's

1821
01:16:27,960 --> 01:16:31,880
Twitter suspension ended she was right

1822
01:16:30,040 --> 01:16:33,800
there to welcome him back and she

1823
01:16:31,880 --> 01:16:35,719
continues to retweet him I've always

1824
01:16:33,800 --> 01:16:37,960
been happy to acknowledge that angry

1825
01:16:35,719 --> 01:16:40,280
trans people on Twitter sometimes take

1826
01:16:37,960 --> 01:16:43,080
things too far things like death threats

1827
01:16:40,280 --> 01:16:45,000
or misogynistic insults I don't support

1828
01:16:43,080 --> 01:16:48,159
that and I've called it out in the past

1829
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:50,719
like when the leftist streamer Vos drama

1830
01:16:48,159 --> 01:16:53,199
alert who is not trans tweeted at JK

1831
01:16:50,719 --> 01:16:55,880
Rowling women be quieter and start

1832
01:16:53,199 --> 01:16:58,440
apologizing challenge I called him out

1833
01:16:55,880 --> 01:17:00,840
tweeting doing edgy ironic misogyny

1834
01:16:58,440 --> 01:17:02,679
while defending trans people magnifies

1835
01:17:00,840 --> 01:17:04,239
the grain of Truth in what turfs say

1836
01:17:02,679 --> 01:17:06,800
about there being misogyny and

1837
01:17:04,239 --> 01:17:08,520
transactivism I tweeted that because I

1838
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:10,480
recognize that if people who are

1839
01:17:08,520 --> 01:17:12,760
claiming to speak for you are doing so

1840
01:17:10,480 --> 01:17:14,840
in a misogynistic way and if you let

1841
01:17:12,760 --> 01:17:15,880
that slide you're going to wake up one

1842
01:17:14,840 --> 01:17:18,199
day to find that you're in a

1843
01:17:15,880 --> 01:17:19,960
misogynistic movement of course vosch

1844
01:17:18,199 --> 01:17:22,679
took the criticism really well

1845
01:17:19,960 --> 01:17:24,280
explaining that actually I just didn't

1846
01:17:22,679 --> 01:17:26,400
understand the complex tactical

1847
01:17:24,280 --> 01:17:28,480
arguments for the moral necessity of

1848
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:30,400
being misogynistic to JK Rowling and

1849
01:17:28,480 --> 01:17:32,159
then he accused me of cancel culturing

1850
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:34,199
him while at the same time literally

1851
01:17:32,159 --> 01:17:36,560
telling his followers to publicly shame

1852
01:17:34,199 --> 01:17:38,800
me the more viewer in the replies being

1853
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:41,199
like that's not what's happening right

1854
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:43,760
here like this is necessary okay

1855
01:17:41,199 --> 01:17:46,000
publicly shame her

1856
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:47,560
into changing her mind on this then

1857
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:51,159
bringing up my past struggle with

1858
01:17:47,560 --> 01:17:53,000
addiction move you off this site and

1859
01:17:51,159 --> 01:17:54,840
into I don't want to bring up the

1860
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:56,320
substance abuse so that pretty much conf

1861
01:17:54,840 --> 01:17:58,120
confirmed to me that vosch doesn't

1862
01:17:56,320 --> 01:18:00,360
actually care about advocating for Trans

1863
01:17:58,120 --> 01:18:02,440
people and just uses trans rights as a

1864
01:18:00,360 --> 01:18:04,120
pretext to act like a [ __ ] Dingus I

1865
01:18:02,440 --> 01:18:06,320
won't tell you to publicly shame him

1866
01:18:04,120 --> 01:18:07,960
though because unlike Vos I would never

1867
01:18:06,320 --> 01:18:10,360
sink to that the point I'm trying to

1868
01:18:07,960 --> 01:18:12,679
make is I have no qualms about calling

1869
01:18:10,360 --> 01:18:15,040
out people on my side whenever they go

1870
01:18:12,679 --> 01:18:16,760
too far or cross a line or do stupid

1871
01:18:15,040 --> 01:18:19,320
tweets and then man explain to me about

1872
01:18:16,760 --> 01:18:21,520
how I don't understand tactical misogyny

1873
01:18:19,320 --> 01:18:24,120
idiot but the same cannot be said of JK

1874
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:26,520
Rowling I have never once seen her call

1875
01:18:24,120 --> 01:18:29,040
out any of the bigotry and abusiveness

1876
01:18:26,520 --> 01:18:31,120
that is absolutely rampant in the gender

1877
01:18:29,040 --> 01:18:33,600
critical movement there's a great video

1878
01:18:31,120 --> 01:18:35,600
called JK Rowling's new friends by

1879
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:37,920
YouTuber Shan that exposes the

1880
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:40,679
dishonesty of framing this conflict as

1881
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:43,280
Meek concerned feminists versus the

1882
01:18:40,679 --> 01:18:45,560
abusive trans mob a framing that the

1883
01:18:43,280 --> 01:18:48,080
Witch Trials of JK ruling accepts

1884
01:18:45,560 --> 01:18:50,080
uncritically citing numerous examples of

1885
01:18:48,080 --> 01:18:54,280
death threats and abusiveness from trans

1886
01:18:50,080 --> 01:18:56,760
Advocates things like kill turfs 2014

1887
01:18:54,280 --> 01:18:59,239
how about slowly and horrendously murder

1888
01:18:56,760 --> 01:19:01,239
turfs in saw like torture machines and

1889
01:18:59,239 --> 01:19:03,199
Contraptions now I don't think anyone

1890
01:19:01,239 --> 01:19:05,960
should joke about putting people in Saw

1891
01:19:03,199 --> 01:19:09,560
traps but also how serious is this

1892
01:19:05,960 --> 01:19:11,320
threat that was posted to Tumblr in 2014

1893
01:19:09,560 --> 01:19:14,199
let's use our critical thinking skills

1894
01:19:11,320 --> 01:19:17,080
here do you think that jigsaw the

1895
01:19:14,199 --> 01:19:19,320
villain from the Saw movies has a Tumblr

1896
01:19:17,080 --> 01:19:20,679
account and is threatening turfs or do

1897
01:19:19,320 --> 01:19:23,239
you think this was posted by a

1898
01:19:20,679 --> 01:19:24,760
14-year-old the podcast cites zero

1899
01:19:23,239 --> 01:19:27,040
examples of death threats and

1900
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:28,840
abusiveness from anti-trans bigots and

1901
01:19:27,040 --> 01:19:31,239
it's not exactly like you have to dig

1902
01:19:28,840 --> 01:19:33,960
deep to find any I can fill the screen

1903
01:19:31,239 --> 01:19:36,080
up with examples just from people who JK

1904
01:19:33,960 --> 01:19:38,199
Rowling has explicitly supported or

1905
01:19:36,080 --> 01:19:40,840
interacted with I will drive you out

1906
01:19:38,199 --> 01:19:43,480
into the desert and bury you 9 ft down

1907
01:19:40,840 --> 01:19:45,480
one tweet says from a fan of JK Rowling

1908
01:19:43,480 --> 01:19:47,480
first I'll set you on fire and piss on

1909
01:19:45,480 --> 01:19:50,280
your half alive corpse [ __ ]

1910
01:19:47,480 --> 01:19:52,360
transactivism [ __ ] gender ideology and

1911
01:19:50,280 --> 01:19:54,719
[ __ ] you another threat from the same

1912
01:19:52,360 --> 01:19:56,960
user is so graphically violent and sex

1913
01:19:54,719 --> 01:19:58,840
ual I don't know if I can even read it

1914
01:19:56,960 --> 01:20:00,880
aloud without violating the YouTube

1915
01:19:58,840 --> 01:20:03,159
terms of service but threats like this

1916
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:05,520
from the gender critical side are simply

1917
01:20:03,159 --> 01:20:07,960
not mentioned in the Witch Trials of JK

1918
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:10,280
Rowling both Rowling and Megan seem

1919
01:20:07,960 --> 01:20:12,760
happy to cherry-pick threatening tweets

1920
01:20:10,280 --> 01:20:15,480
and sound bites of shouting protesters

1921
01:20:12,760 --> 01:20:17,159
[ __ ] you you ugly piece of [ __ ] you look

1922
01:20:15,480 --> 01:20:19,639
like you got your teeth knocked out you

1923
01:20:17,159 --> 01:20:21,719
[ __ ] fist as evidence that the trans

1924
01:20:19,639 --> 01:20:24,040
movement is dangerous and Insidious to

1925
01:20:21,719 --> 01:20:25,840
the core but this exact technique has

1926
01:20:24,040 --> 01:20:28,520
been used against literally every

1927
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:31,560
Liberation movement in world history for

1928
01:20:28,520 --> 01:20:33,400
example let's consider reclaim the KN

1929
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:35,800
the protest movement against sexual

1930
01:20:33,400 --> 01:20:37,840
violence in Britain which first got JK

1931
01:20:35,800 --> 01:20:40,480
rolling interested in feminism in the

1932
01:20:37,840 --> 01:20:42,840
1970s here's how the guardian Britain's

1933
01:20:40,480 --> 01:20:45,880
spineless Centrist paper of note cover

1934
01:20:42,840 --> 01:20:47,920
to reclaimed the night protest in 1979

1935
01:20:45,880 --> 01:20:49,920
chanting slogans against rape seems

1936
01:20:47,920 --> 01:20:51,880
reasonable to promote awareness but what

1937
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:55,480
about the hissing and swearing at any

1938
01:20:51,880 --> 01:20:57,000
innocent male and cries of castrate men

1939
01:20:55,480 --> 01:20:58,760
we were all sympathetic to the

1940
01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:00,679
principles of the women's Liberation

1941
01:20:58,760 --> 01:21:03,080
movement but we left the crowd of

1942
01:21:00,679 --> 01:21:05,280
shouting torch bearing women when it

1943
01:21:03,080 --> 01:21:07,239
became clear that my friend's brother

1944
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:09,520
was running the risk of personal

1945
01:21:07,239 --> 01:21:12,040
mutilation if he remained with us the

1946
01:21:09,520 --> 01:21:15,159
protesters were allegedly singing here I

1947
01:21:12,040 --> 01:21:18,000
stand my knife in hand free castration

1948
01:21:15,159 --> 01:21:20,480
on demand so this is how the British

1949
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:23,159
press covered the women's movement angry

1950
01:21:20,480 --> 01:21:25,679
torch bearing women screaming castrate

1951
01:21:23,159 --> 01:21:27,719
men now is that a fig representation of

1952
01:21:25,679 --> 01:21:29,679
the women's movement should we judge

1953
01:21:27,719 --> 01:21:32,840
every Movement by its most militant

1954
01:21:29,679 --> 01:21:35,239
extremists is it fair say to pretend

1955
01:21:32,840 --> 01:21:37,280
that Valerie solanis who shot Andy

1956
01:21:35,239 --> 01:21:39,520
Warhol who advocated for male

1957
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:42,199
extermination in her Society for cutting

1958
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:44,719
up men Manifesto is representative of

1959
01:21:42,199 --> 01:21:47,000
feminism as a whole many anti-feminists

1960
01:21:44,719 --> 01:21:49,960
over the years have done exactly that

1961
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:51,600
but it's not fair is it so why does JK

1962
01:21:49,960 --> 01:21:53,920
rlling think it's fair to judge the

1963
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:55,719
trans Movement by the worst things trans

1964
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:58,280
people have ever tweeted I want her to

1965
01:21:55,719 --> 01:22:00,719
choke on my fat trans dick and I made

1966
01:21:58,280 --> 01:22:03,239
excuses for you Z in the fourth episode

1967
01:22:00,719 --> 01:22:05,120
of The Witch Trials of JK rolling Megan

1968
01:22:03,239 --> 01:22:06,840
interviews New York Times columnist

1969
01:22:05,120 --> 01:22:08,440
Michelle Goldberg who has written

1970
01:22:06,840 --> 01:22:10,000
sympathetically about transphobic

1971
01:22:08,440 --> 01:22:11,560
feminism there's a moment in this

1972
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:14,080
interview where Michelle kind of

1973
01:22:11,560 --> 01:22:16,199
stumbles into an honest observation that

1974
01:22:14,080 --> 01:22:18,280
I find fascinating right I mean I think

1975
01:22:16,199 --> 01:22:20,199
you'll often hear people say you know

1976
01:22:18,280 --> 01:22:22,360
I'm not going to debate my basic

1977
01:22:20,199 --> 01:22:24,159
humanity and and part of the difficulty

1978
01:22:22,360 --> 01:22:26,520
is that there are indeed certain issues

1979
01:22:24,159 --> 01:22:28,520
which we have sort of decided somewhat

1980
01:22:26,520 --> 01:22:31,320
collectively with some sort of consensus

1981
01:22:28,520 --> 01:22:34,000
are beyond the realm of of debate and I

1982
01:22:31,320 --> 01:22:35,040
think that part of what is so difficult

1983
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,760
about this issue is that there are

1984
01:22:35,040 --> 01:22:39,960
certain people who think that this kind

1985
01:22:36,760 --> 01:22:41,560
of consensus can be imposed maybe as

1986
01:22:39,960 --> 01:22:44,040
opposed to evolve

1987
01:22:41,560 --> 01:22:48,120
organically and so they're sort of

1988
01:22:44,040 --> 01:22:51,000
desperately trying to shore it up in the

1989
01:22:48,120 --> 01:22:54,120
hopes I think that if they can they will

1990
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:56,280
enjoy the same sort of assumed

1991
01:22:54,120 --> 01:22:58,719
protection ction as other groups whose

1992
01:22:56,280 --> 01:23:01,360
rights we've decided are not up

1993
01:22:58,719 --> 01:23:02,880
for public conversation I think the

1994
01:23:01,360 --> 01:23:05,400
problem is that we don't actually have a

1995
01:23:02,880 --> 01:23:07,080
consensus so Michelle correctly observes

1996
01:23:05,400 --> 01:23:09,320
that the reason trans people are often

1997
01:23:07,080 --> 01:23:11,560
reluctant to debate our rights is that

1998
01:23:09,320 --> 01:23:13,440
we want the same assumed protections as

1999
01:23:11,560 --> 01:23:16,120
other groups whose rights liberals have

2000
01:23:13,440 --> 01:23:18,679
decided are not up for debate but then

2001
01:23:16,120 --> 01:23:20,719
Michelle suggests that trans people have

2002
01:23:18,679 --> 01:23:23,560
to debate our rights because there isn't

2003
01:23:20,719 --> 01:23:26,159
a mainstream consensus that we deserve

2004
01:23:23,560 --> 01:23:28,280
rights I am really curious to know how

2005
01:23:26,159 --> 01:23:30,400
Michelle Goldberg thinks that past

2006
01:23:28,280 --> 01:23:32,239
Liberation movements have succeeded like

2007
01:23:30,400 --> 01:23:34,520
does she think that women's suffrage

2008
01:23:32,239 --> 01:23:37,120
just evolved organically did

2009
01:23:34,520 --> 01:23:39,040
suffragettes just have calm civil

2010
01:23:37,120 --> 01:23:41,360
conversations about whether women are

2011
01:23:39,040 --> 01:23:43,360
intellectually capable of voting until

2012
01:23:41,360 --> 01:23:46,000
all the misogynists were rationally

2013
01:23:43,360 --> 01:23:48,800
persuaded no they stood up and demanded

2014
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:51,000
their right to vote sometimes violently

2015
01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:52,440
especially in the UK like people forget

2016
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:54,159
this maybe because they were called

2017
01:23:52,440 --> 01:23:56,400
suffragettes which is kind of a cute

2018
01:23:54,159 --> 01:23:58,360
scen name but the suffragettes they

2019
01:23:56,400 --> 01:24:00,400
murdered people they were suffragette

2020
01:23:58,360 --> 01:24:03,080
terrorists they broke Windows they

2021
01:24:00,400 --> 01:24:05,960
bombed churches they set fire to a

2022
01:24:03,080 --> 01:24:08,120
theater in 1909 a suffragette attacked

2023
01:24:05,960 --> 01:24:09,800
Winston Churchill with a horse whip

2024
01:24:08,120 --> 01:24:12,360
Queen [ __ ] honestly the English

2025
01:24:09,800 --> 01:24:14,719
suffragette Mary Lee threw a [ __ ]

2026
01:24:12,360 --> 01:24:16,920
Hatchet at the prime minister's head and

2027
01:24:14,719 --> 01:24:18,800
my point is not to Advocate terrorism or

2028
01:24:16,920 --> 01:24:20,679
to excuse the terrorism of past

2029
01:24:18,800 --> 01:24:22,400
movements I think these kinds of tactics

2030
01:24:20,679 --> 01:24:24,440
have tended to turn people against the

2031
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:26,120
movement I don't think it's effective

2032
01:24:24,440 --> 01:24:28,400
but let's not pretend that past

2033
01:24:26,120 --> 01:24:30,360
movements have never made demands before

2034
01:24:28,400 --> 01:24:32,639
everyone was ready because there never

2035
01:24:30,360 --> 01:24:35,040
has been and there never will be a time

2036
01:24:32,639 --> 01:24:37,000
when everyone is ready I mean Mary W

2037
01:24:35,040 --> 01:24:40,560
stonecraft published the Vindication of

2038
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:42,600
the rights of women in 1792 and misogyny

2039
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:44,719
in case you hadn't noticed remains

2040
01:24:42,600 --> 01:24:46,800
rampant so there never has been a

2041
01:24:44,719 --> 01:24:48,920
consensus about women's rights and there

2042
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:51,560
probably never will be in fact

2043
01:24:48,920 --> 01:24:53,719
marginalized groups wouldn't need rights

2044
01:24:51,560 --> 01:24:55,639
if there was a consensus that we deserve

2045
01:24:53,719 --> 01:24:57,480
rights the whole reason to have rights

2046
01:24:55,639 --> 01:24:59,199
is to protect you from the kind of

2047
01:24:57,480 --> 01:25:00,760
people who think you shouldn't have them

2048
01:24:59,199 --> 01:25:02,639
I mean it's a nice thought that we can

2049
01:25:00,760 --> 01:25:05,360
just politely persuade everyone to give

2050
01:25:02,639 --> 01:25:07,440
us rights but the reality is that's not

2051
01:25:05,360 --> 01:25:09,560
how this works and it never has been

2052
01:25:07,440 --> 01:25:11,639
like how do these debate me centrists

2053
01:25:09,560 --> 01:25:14,880
think that slavery ended in the United

2054
01:25:11,639 --> 01:25:17,679
States well between 1861 and

2055
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:20,239
1865 there was a little event called the

2056
01:25:17,679 --> 01:25:22,119
American Civil debate see what I'm

2057
01:25:20,239 --> 01:25:24,400
holding in my hand this is a high

2058
01:25:22,119 --> 01:25:26,719
caliber idea that I picked off the

2059
01:25:24,400 --> 01:25:28,239
polite discussion field of Manasses do

2060
01:25:26,719 --> 01:25:29,880
you people think that American schools

2061
01:25:28,239 --> 01:25:32,320
were integrated because all the white

2062
01:25:29,880 --> 01:25:34,880
people in the South were persuaded that

2063
01:25:32,320 --> 01:25:36,719
segregation is bad no Dum Dums

2064
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:38,360
Eisenhower had to send in the 101st

2065
01:25:36,719 --> 01:25:40,600
Airborne to enforce that [ __ ] at

2066
01:25:38,360 --> 01:25:42,760
gunpoint and my point is not to equate

2067
01:25:40,600 --> 01:25:44,480
LGBT rights movements with black civil

2068
01:25:42,760 --> 01:25:46,239
rights I am aware that being a white

2069
01:25:44,480 --> 01:25:48,400
queer person is not in any way

2070
01:25:46,239 --> 01:25:50,000
equivalent to living in the aftermath of

2071
01:25:48,400 --> 01:25:52,719
slavery I'm just saying that there's

2072
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:55,199
this tendency to sanitize history and to

2073
01:25:52,719 --> 01:25:57,639
imagine that progress with smooth and

2074
01:25:55,199 --> 01:26:00,239
bloodless that consensus evolved

2075
01:25:57,639 --> 01:26:01,840
organically when it just didn't and then

2076
01:26:00,239 --> 01:26:04,440
people get the impression that current

2077
01:26:01,840 --> 01:26:06,679
movements are somehow more militant than

2078
01:26:04,440 --> 01:26:10,400
successful past movements when they just

2079
01:26:06,679 --> 01:26:13,600
aren't I am fighting what I see as a

2080
01:26:10,400 --> 01:26:16,639
powerful Insidious misogynistic movement

2081
01:26:13,600 --> 01:26:19,400
the cultural movement that was illiberal

2082
01:26:16,639 --> 01:26:22,360
in its methods and I believe

2083
01:26:19,400 --> 01:26:24,760
absolutely that there is something

2084
01:26:22,360 --> 01:26:27,639
dangerous about this movement and it

2085
01:26:24,760 --> 01:26:30,960
must be challenged why is JK rolling

2086
01:26:27,639 --> 01:26:34,080
like this chapter S why is JK rolling

2087
01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:36,480
like this JK ring loves to quote radical

2088
01:26:34,080 --> 01:26:38,920
feminist Andrea dworin whom I've already

2089
01:26:36,480 --> 01:26:42,600
mentioned a couple times in this video I

2090
01:26:38,920 --> 01:26:45,000
myself favor violence deeply I favor it

2091
01:26:42,600 --> 01:26:47,679
dworin is known for her extreme sex

2092
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:49,840
negative views which I don't agree with

2093
01:26:47,679 --> 01:26:52,360
but she wasn't interesting writer one of

2094
01:26:49,840 --> 01:26:54,239
those half crazed savants who gets in

2095
01:26:52,360 --> 01:26:56,800
your head who you can't stop thinking

2096
01:26:54,239 --> 01:26:59,639
thinking about in my opinion doran's

2097
01:26:56,800 --> 01:27:02,760
best book is right-wing women published

2098
01:26:59,639 --> 01:27:05,159
in 1983 the era of Phyllis schafle and

2099
01:27:02,760 --> 01:27:07,760
Anita Bryant right-wing women is an

2100
01:27:05,159 --> 01:27:10,199
analysis of why so many women are drawn

2101
01:27:07,760 --> 01:27:12,480
to conservative politics seemingly

2102
01:27:10,199 --> 01:27:14,239
against their own interests anyone who's

2103
01:27:12,480 --> 01:27:16,880
interested in understanding the gender

2104
01:27:14,239 --> 01:27:19,639
critical movement a crypto reactionary

2105
01:27:16,880 --> 01:27:21,639
backlash disguising itself as feminism

2106
01:27:19,639 --> 01:27:23,600
should read this book in dworkin's

2107
01:27:21,639 --> 01:27:25,920
analysis the political right makes

2108
01:27:23,600 --> 01:27:28,280
certain physical and material promises

2109
01:27:25,920 --> 01:27:30,440
to women that both exploit and quiet

2110
01:27:28,280 --> 01:27:32,520
some of women's deepest fears no one can

2111
01:27:30,440 --> 01:27:34,159
bear to live a meaningless life women

2112
01:27:32,520 --> 01:27:37,080
fight for meaning just as women fight

2113
01:27:34,159 --> 01:27:39,920
for survival and conservative politics

2114
01:27:37,080 --> 01:27:42,480
promises women meaning the right offers

2115
01:27:39,920 --> 01:27:45,560
women a simple fixed predetermined

2116
01:27:42,480 --> 01:27:48,800
social biological and sexual order form

2117
01:27:45,560 --> 01:27:50,719
conquers chaos form banishes confusion

2118
01:27:48,800 --> 01:27:53,320
the gender critical movement offers

2119
01:27:50,719 --> 01:27:57,080
women a brutally simple understanding of

2120
01:27:53,320 --> 01:28:00,119
sex and gender a woman is an adult human

2121
01:27:57,080 --> 01:28:02,880
female right-wing anti-trans activist

2122
01:28:00,119 --> 01:28:04,639
posie Parker has made this phrase into

2123
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:09,119
the motto of the gender critical

2124
01:28:04,639 --> 01:28:11,600
movement adult human female it's on

2125
01:28:09,119 --> 01:28:14,800
billboards it's on t-shirts it's on

2126
01:28:11,600 --> 01:28:17,400
banners signs and tweets presented with

2127
01:28:14,800 --> 01:28:20,960
the authority of a dictionary definition

2128
01:28:17,400 --> 01:28:23,080
it's rigid it's orderly it's immutable

2129
01:28:20,960 --> 01:28:26,600
there are no Exceptions there are no

2130
01:28:23,080 --> 01:28:29,080
Blurred Lines there can be no change

2131
01:28:26,600 --> 01:28:31,520
this Mantra is a defense against the

2132
01:28:29,080 --> 01:28:34,199
conceptual instability and Chaos that

2133
01:28:31,520 --> 01:28:36,560
gender critical fear the same fear that

2134
01:28:34,199 --> 01:28:39,280
once drove homophobic women like Anita

2135
01:28:36,560 --> 01:28:41,000
Bryant just biologically that God made

2136
01:28:39,280 --> 01:28:43,000
mother so that we could reproduce

2137
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:45,920
homosexuals cannot reproduce

2138
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:48,320
biologically erasing the concept of sex

2139
01:28:45,920 --> 01:28:50,880
removes the ability of many to

2140
01:28:48,320 --> 01:28:53,360
meaningfully discuss their lives dworin

2141
01:28:50,880 --> 01:28:55,320
says within the frame of male domination

2142
01:28:53,360 --> 01:28:58,080
there is a good reason for women to hate

2143
01:28:55,320 --> 01:29:00,760
homosexuality both male and female women

2144
01:28:58,080 --> 01:29:03,239
are interchangeable as sex objects women

2145
01:29:00,760 --> 01:29:05,320
are slightly less disposable as mothers

2146
01:29:03,239 --> 01:29:07,440
the only dignity and value women get is

2147
01:29:05,320 --> 01:29:10,119
as mothers having children is the one

2148
01:29:07,440 --> 01:29:12,639
social contribution credited to women it

2149
01:29:10,119 --> 01:29:14,320
is the Bedrock of women's social worth

2150
01:29:12,639 --> 01:29:16,760
without childbearing women know they

2151
01:29:14,320 --> 01:29:19,639
have nothing homosexuality for women

2152
01:29:16,760 --> 01:29:22,080
means having nothing it means Extinction

2153
01:29:19,639 --> 01:29:24,239
substitute transgenderism for

2154
01:29:22,080 --> 01:29:26,920
homosexuality and you'll understand the

2155
01:29:24,239 --> 01:29:30,960
gender critical movement JK Rowling's

2156
01:29:26,920 --> 01:29:33,679
definition of woman is this the woman is

2157
01:29:30,960 --> 01:29:36,880
um the producer of the large gametes the

2158
01:29:33,679 --> 01:29:39,440
producer of the large gametes roling

2159
01:29:36,880 --> 01:29:43,119
says her primary concern about young

2160
01:29:39,440 --> 01:29:45,440
trans men is the loss of fertility

2161
01:29:43,119 --> 01:29:47,600
homosexuality its rise in public

2162
01:29:45,440 --> 01:29:50,320
visibility attempts to socially

2163
01:29:47,600 --> 01:29:52,719
legitimize or protect it makes women

2164
01:29:50,320 --> 01:29:54,719
Expendable the one thing women can do

2165
01:29:52,719 --> 01:29:57,840
and be valued for will no longer be

2166
01:29:54,719 --> 01:29:59,920
valued male homosexuality is especially

2167
01:29:57,840 --> 01:30:02,360
terrifying because it suggests a world

2168
01:29:59,920 --> 01:30:05,600
without women altogether a world in

2169
01:30:02,360 --> 01:30:07,639
which women are extinct this exact fear

2170
01:30:05,600 --> 01:30:10,400
appears frequently in gender critical

2171
01:30:07,639 --> 01:30:13,480
rhetoric trans activists are erasing

2172
01:30:10,400 --> 01:30:16,440
women they're erasing biological sex

2173
01:30:13,480 --> 01:30:18,880
they're going to call us pregnant people

2174
01:30:16,440 --> 01:30:21,159
confused girls are being robbed of their

2175
01:30:18,880 --> 01:30:24,000
precious fertility trans women are going

2176
01:30:21,159 --> 01:30:25,639
to replace biological women as a woman

2177
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:27,400
woman I feel threatened because

2178
01:30:25,639 --> 01:30:30,520
biological men are aggressively

2179
01:30:27,400 --> 01:30:32,639
replacing women you will not replace us

2180
01:30:30,520 --> 01:30:34,679
sometimes this paranoia ramps up to the

2181
01:30:32,639 --> 01:30:39,400
point of obsession and the results can

2182
01:30:34,679 --> 01:30:41,360
be dazzling in September 2022 Maya forat

2183
01:30:39,400 --> 01:30:43,520
Who you'll remember as the anti-trans

2184
01:30:41,360 --> 01:30:45,960
activist whom JK Rowling came out as a

2185
01:30:43,520 --> 01:30:47,960
Turf to defend went on a full-blown

2186
01:30:45,960 --> 01:30:50,280
Twitter Rampage because the Herford

2187
01:30:47,960 --> 01:30:52,920
Shure County Libraries announced they

2188
01:30:50,280 --> 01:30:55,719
were changing their children's storytime

2189
01:30:52,920 --> 01:30:58,040
mascot from the book start bear if you

2190
01:30:55,719 --> 01:31:00,760
don't know where this is going strap in

2191
01:30:58,040 --> 01:31:05,159
from the book start bear to a bright

2192
01:31:00,760 --> 01:31:07,360
vibrant gender neutral creature called

2193
01:31:05,159 --> 01:31:10,280
tala are you

2194
01:31:07,360 --> 01:31:12,679
enraged if not you haven't been spending

2195
01:31:10,280 --> 01:31:14,639
enough time on mum's net Maya tweeted

2196
01:31:12,679 --> 01:31:17,199
the words of an indignant mother who

2197
01:31:14,639 --> 01:31:20,280
referred to Talia wait wasn't it tala

2198
01:31:17,199 --> 01:31:23,119
referring to Talia as a trans bear with

2199
01:31:20,280 --> 01:31:27,440
they them pronouns describing the mascot

2200
01:31:23,119 --> 01:31:31,040
as IDE olical creepy and gaslighting I

2201
01:31:27,440 --> 01:31:33,800
cannot express how upset I feel the

2202
01:31:31,040 --> 01:31:37,440
library jumped in to clarify that tala

2203
01:31:33,800 --> 01:31:39,639
not Talia isn't trans they are an alien

2204
01:31:37,440 --> 01:31:42,239
Maya then demanded to know how this

2205
01:31:39,639 --> 01:31:45,040
alien was birthed did it hatch from an

2206
01:31:42,239 --> 01:31:46,920
egg or was it born from a mama some

2207
01:31:45,040 --> 01:31:48,560
people tried to reason with Maya there's

2208
01:31:46,920 --> 01:31:50,880
an advantage in having a character that

2209
01:31:48,560 --> 01:31:52,880
isn't identifiably male or female as it

2210
01:31:50,880 --> 01:31:56,119
can be equally relatable to either sex

2211
01:31:52,880 --> 01:31:58,600
and avoid promoting stereotypes but Maya

2212
01:31:56,119 --> 01:32:00,679
was not convinced it seems highly

2213
01:31:58,600 --> 01:32:02,960
unlikely that an alien that had evolved

2214
01:32:00,679 --> 01:32:05,760
with such recognizable vertebrate body

2215
01:32:02,960 --> 01:32:08,159
plan is not sexually reproducing it's a

2216
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:09,400
relatable anthropomorphic character not

2217
01:32:08,159 --> 01:32:14,080
a slime

2218
01:32:09,400 --> 01:32:18,360
mold I need to know how the alien [ __ ]

2219
01:32:14,080 --> 01:32:22,440
right now I said I need to know how the

2220
01:32:18,360 --> 01:32:25,440
alien [ __ ] before I can show it to my

2221
01:32:22,440 --> 01:32:25,440
child

2222
01:32:26,679 --> 01:32:31,520
when Twitter understandably laughed it

2223
01:32:28,840 --> 01:32:34,119
up at Maya's expense she just kept

2224
01:32:31,520 --> 01:32:35,880
posting and she posted hard honestly I

2225
01:32:34,119 --> 01:32:38,400
don't know if I've ever seen anyone post

2226
01:32:35,880 --> 01:32:40,040
so hard in a lengthy diet tribe Maya

2227
01:32:38,400 --> 01:32:42,639
wrote about the miseries of new

2228
01:32:40,040 --> 01:32:44,480
motherhood you are in charge of a baby

2229
01:32:42,639 --> 01:32:45,960
you have never done this before you

2230
01:32:44,480 --> 01:32:48,159
haven't had a good night's sleep for

2231
01:32:45,960 --> 01:32:49,800
months and won't for years everyone has

2232
01:32:48,159 --> 01:32:52,159
an opinion on what you are doing right

2233
01:32:49,800 --> 01:32:54,880
and wrong and you've become invisible

2234
01:32:52,159 --> 01:32:58,360
you had politics you had had a career

2235
01:32:54,880 --> 01:33:00,239
you had interests you had a sex life now

2236
01:32:58,360 --> 01:33:02,280
you have the daily needs of a completely

2237
01:33:00,239 --> 01:33:05,040
dependent person and your world has

2238
01:33:02,280 --> 01:33:07,320
shrunk the fact that these men and the

2239
01:33:05,040 --> 01:33:10,040
young women that cheer them on think

2240
01:33:07,320 --> 01:33:12,040
this is so laughable reflect society's

2241
01:33:10,040 --> 01:33:14,320
disdain from mothers this is what it

2242
01:33:12,040 --> 01:33:16,600
means to say a woman is not a feeling or

2243
01:33:14,320 --> 01:33:20,520
a costume this is why the Hub of the

2244
01:33:16,600 --> 01:33:22,600
resistance is on Mom's net so I am

2245
01:33:20,520 --> 01:33:24,520
fascinated by this thread I think it's

2246
01:33:22,600 --> 01:33:26,600
one of the most revealing texts in

2247
01:33:24,520 --> 01:33:30,520
gender critical history because you know

2248
01:33:26,600 --> 01:33:33,159
what Maya forter actually does have

2249
01:33:30,520 --> 01:33:35,360
valid concerns but the concerns she has

2250
01:33:33,159 --> 01:33:37,760
that are valid have nothing to do with

2251
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:40,440
trans people and they definitely have

2252
01:33:37,760 --> 01:33:43,920
nothing to do with an adorable cartoon

2253
01:33:40,440 --> 01:33:47,520
alien honestly reading this I have some

2254
01:33:43,920 --> 01:33:50,639
concerns concerns like where is Maya's

2255
01:33:47,520 --> 01:33:53,280
husband I know she has one isn't raising

2256
01:33:50,639 --> 01:33:55,760
children supposed to be a mutual project

2257
01:33:53,280 --> 01:33:59,119
no one should have to feel this alone

2258
01:33:55,760 --> 01:34:00,960
raising children that is a valid concern

2259
01:33:59,119 --> 01:34:04,480
oh my God we actually found one it's

2260
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:07,480
like finding elderado a valid concern a

2261
01:34:04,480 --> 01:34:09,560
valid concern isn't what's going on here

2262
01:34:07,480 --> 01:34:11,400
that Maya is taking legitimate feelings

2263
01:34:09,560 --> 01:34:13,480
of being overburdened and

2264
01:34:11,400 --> 01:34:15,920
underappreciated and displacing those

2265
01:34:13,480 --> 01:34:17,840
feelings onto transgender people this is

2266
01:34:15,920 --> 01:34:20,960
exactly how the gender critical movement

2267
01:34:17,840 --> 01:34:23,199
recruits by providing a scapegoat to

2268
01:34:20,960 --> 01:34:25,119
frustrated women it's not your husband's

2269
01:34:23,199 --> 01:34:27,480
neglect it's not the increasing

2270
01:34:25,119 --> 01:34:30,840
automization of society it's not the

2271
01:34:27,480 --> 01:34:34,239
indignities of Aging it's tala the

2272
01:34:30,840 --> 01:34:37,560
nonbinary alien with its dkeries and

2273
01:34:34,239 --> 01:34:40,080
smug Aura of gender neutrality mom's net

2274
01:34:37,560 --> 01:34:42,199
is the Hub of the resistance to

2275
01:34:40,080 --> 01:34:43,760
non-binary cartoons it's too much these

2276
01:34:42,199 --> 01:34:46,000
people are too much okay we have to be

2277
01:34:43,760 --> 01:34:49,119
serious now the political right also

2278
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:51,040
promises women Safety and Security for

2279
01:34:49,119 --> 01:34:53,320
women the world is a very dangerous

2280
01:34:51,040 --> 01:34:54,280
place the right acknowledges the reality

2281
01:34:53,320 --> 01:34:56,320
of d

2282
01:34:54,280 --> 01:34:58,800
the validity of fear the right then

2283
01:34:56,320 --> 01:35:01,000
manipulates the fear women fear and

2284
01:34:58,800 --> 01:35:02,920
resent male violence which they're most

2285
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:06,159
likely to experience from the men

2286
01:35:02,920 --> 01:35:08,320
closest to them boyfriends husbands and

2287
01:35:06,159 --> 01:35:10,440
fathers they're most likely to be killed

2288
01:35:08,320 --> 01:35:13,119
by sexual partners but the need to

2289
01:35:10,440 --> 01:35:15,280
survive in a male-dominated society

2290
01:35:13,119 --> 01:35:18,320
means that women's legitimate fears and

2291
01:35:15,280 --> 01:35:20,679
resentments often cannot be directed at

2292
01:35:18,320 --> 01:35:22,679
the men with power inevitably this

2293
01:35:20,679 --> 01:35:24,880
causes women to take the rage and

2294
01:35:22,679 --> 01:35:27,560
contempt they feel for the men who

2295
01:35:24,880 --> 01:35:30,920
actually abused them those close to them

2296
01:35:27,560 --> 01:35:32,960
and projected onto others those far away

2297
01:35:30,920 --> 01:35:35,080
foreign or different and this

2298
01:35:32,960 --> 01:35:37,320
displacement of rage is just

2299
01:35:35,080 --> 01:35:39,840
transparently what's going on with JK

2300
01:35:37,320 --> 01:35:42,600
Rowling in her essay about sex and

2301
01:35:39,840 --> 01:35:45,239
gender issues Rowling speculates that

2302
01:35:42,600 --> 01:35:47,960
trans men are transitioning to be the

2303
01:35:45,239 --> 01:35:49,760
son her father wanted I really felt the

2304
01:35:47,960 --> 01:35:51,560
rejection of my father and that is one

2305
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:53,639
of the things that maybe lead someone

2306
01:35:51,560 --> 01:35:55,960
going into homosexuality and she

2307
01:35:53,639 --> 01:35:58,199
describes the lingering Trauma from her

2308
01:35:55,960 --> 01:36:00,480
first violent marriage the marriage at

2309
01:35:58,199 --> 01:36:03,199
this point has turned very violent and

2310
01:36:00,480 --> 01:36:06,080
very controlling and that she says is

2311
01:36:03,199 --> 01:36:08,880
why she decided to speak out against the

2312
01:36:06,080 --> 01:36:11,040
transgender movement if you try to

2313
01:36:08,880 --> 01:36:13,679
understand this rationally it looks like

2314
01:36:11,040 --> 01:36:16,000
a total non Secor but if you look at it

2315
01:36:13,679 --> 01:36:17,920
emotionally there's a kind of logic to

2316
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:19,960
it the existence of the dangerous

2317
01:36:17,920 --> 01:36:23,159
Outsider always functions for women

2318
01:36:19,960 --> 01:36:25,480
simultaneously as deception diversion

2319
01:36:23,159 --> 01:36:27,800
pain killer and threat women cling to

2320
01:36:25,480 --> 01:36:29,960
irrational hatreds focused particularly

2321
01:36:27,800 --> 01:36:32,239
on the unfamiliar so that they will not

2322
01:36:29,960 --> 01:36:34,480
murder their fathers husbands Sons

2323
01:36:32,239 --> 01:36:37,440
Brothers lovers the men with whom they

2324
01:36:34,480 --> 01:36:40,360
are intimate those who do hurt them in

2325
01:36:37,440 --> 01:36:43,159
the 1970s many conservative women

2326
01:36:40,360 --> 01:36:45,639
displaced this rage onto lesbians the

2327
01:36:43,159 --> 01:36:47,639
threatening Outsider of the day dorin

2328
01:36:45,639 --> 01:36:50,639
attended the National Women's Conference

2329
01:36:47,639 --> 01:36:53,600
in 1977 where she spoke to a lot of

2330
01:36:50,639 --> 01:36:55,400
women about their fear of lesbians

2331
01:36:53,600 --> 01:36:57,400
right-wing women consistently spoke to

2332
01:36:55,400 --> 01:36:59,880
me about lesbians as if lesbians were

2333
01:36:57,400 --> 01:37:02,320
rapists certified committers of sexual

2334
01:36:59,880 --> 01:37:05,000
assault against women and girls to them

2335
01:37:02,320 --> 01:37:07,560
the lesbian was inherently monstrous

2336
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:10,520
experienced almost as a demonic sexual

2337
01:37:07,560 --> 01:37:13,440
Force hovering closer and closer she was

2338
01:37:10,520 --> 01:37:15,360
the dangerous Intruder encroaching

2339
01:37:13,440 --> 01:37:17,920
threatening by her very presence a

2340
01:37:15,360 --> 01:37:20,520
sexual order that cannot bear scrutiny

2341
01:37:17,920 --> 01:37:23,560
or withstand challenge is almost surreal

2342
01:37:20,520 --> 01:37:25,719
to read this because of how precisely it

2343
01:37:23,560 --> 01:37:27,960
describes how gender criticals talk

2344
01:37:25,719 --> 01:37:30,520
about trans women pronouns are like

2345
01:37:27,960 --> 01:37:33,159
Rohypnol they dull your defenses they

2346
01:37:30,520 --> 01:37:35,679
change your inhibitions they're meant to

2347
01:37:33,159 --> 01:37:38,880
now it's true that trans exclusionary

2348
01:37:35,679 --> 01:37:41,440
radical feminism began as an offshoot of

2349
01:37:38,880 --> 01:37:44,040
far-left lesbian separatism with

2350
01:37:41,440 --> 01:37:47,639
academic feminist Janice Raymond writing

2351
01:37:44,040 --> 01:37:50,679
in 1979 that transsexualism should be

2352
01:37:47,639 --> 01:37:52,639
morally mandated out of existence but

2353
01:37:50,679 --> 01:37:54,639
the gender critical movement was always

2354
01:37:52,639 --> 01:37:57,400
destined to be become a right-wing

2355
01:37:54,639 --> 01:37:59,599
movement because it has the structure of

2356
01:37:57,400 --> 01:38:02,239
a right-wing movement taking women's

2357
01:37:59,599 --> 01:38:04,639
fear and rage toward familiar men and

2358
01:38:02,239 --> 01:38:07,360
displacing it onto an unfamiliar

2359
01:38:04,639 --> 01:38:09,280
Outsider the momentum behind this is

2360
01:38:07,360 --> 01:38:12,159
just too ripe an opportunity for

2361
01:38:09,280 --> 01:38:14,400
conservatives to pass up as dworin says

2362
01:38:12,159 --> 01:38:16,159
because women so displace their rage

2363
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:19,040
they are easily controlled and

2364
01:38:16,159 --> 01:38:21,480
manipulated haters women require symbols

2365
01:38:19,040 --> 01:38:23,560
of danger that justify Their Fear the

2366
01:38:21,480 --> 01:38:25,719
right provides these symbols of danger

2367
01:38:23,560 --> 01:38:28,280
by designating clearly defined groups of

2368
01:38:25,719 --> 01:38:31,280
Outsiders as sources of danger in the

2369
01:38:28,280 --> 01:38:33,440
2020s anti-trans bigotry has become a

2370
01:38:31,280 --> 01:38:36,000
key Stone of conservative party

2371
01:38:33,440 --> 01:38:37,840
platforms both in the UK where Lee

2372
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:39,639
Anderson Deputy chair of the

2373
01:38:37,840 --> 01:38:41,719
conservative party predicts that the

2374
01:38:39,639 --> 01:38:43,920
next election will be won on probably be

2375
01:38:41,719 --> 01:38:47,040
a c mix of culture wars and trans

2376
01:38:43,920 --> 01:38:50,119
debates and in the US where the ACLU is

2377
01:38:47,040 --> 01:38:53,440
currently tracking more than 450

2378
01:38:50,119 --> 01:38:56,520
anti-lgbt bills including more than 130

2379
01:38:53,440 --> 01:39:00,480
gender affirming care bands 51 trans

2380
01:38:56,520 --> 01:39:03,480
Sports bans 40 drag bands 29 trans b

2381
01:39:00,480 --> 01:39:05,639
band and 21 bands defining trans people

2382
01:39:03,480 --> 01:39:07,760
out of the law Republicans have

2383
01:39:05,639 --> 01:39:10,360
escalated anti-trans rhetoric to

2384
01:39:07,760 --> 01:39:12,760
eliminationist extremes that have most

2385
01:39:10,360 --> 01:39:15,599
trans people in this country living in a

2386
01:39:12,760 --> 01:39:18,480
constant state of fear for our future

2387
01:39:15,599 --> 01:39:20,920
transgenderism must be eradicated from

2388
01:39:18,480 --> 01:39:24,080
public life entirely the left is

2389
01:39:20,920 --> 01:39:26,599
attacking our children pushing sex

2390
01:39:24,080 --> 01:39:29,280
transgender extremism and noxious

2391
01:39:26,599 --> 01:39:31,599
politics in our schools we should reject

2392
01:39:29,280 --> 01:39:33,840
this demonic assault on the innocence of

2393
01:39:31,599 --> 01:39:36,400
our children and Stand Fast against

2394
01:39:33,840 --> 01:39:40,280
leftist efforts to mutilate their bodies

2395
01:39:36,400 --> 01:39:44,400
and Minds stop confusing our babies with

2396
01:39:40,280 --> 01:39:47,360
your groomer gender ideologue I will

2397
01:39:44,400 --> 01:39:50,639
revoke every Biden policy promoting the

2398
01:39:47,360 --> 01:39:54,920
chemical castration and sexual

2399
01:39:50,639 --> 01:39:57,360
muiz of our youth

2400
01:39:54,920 --> 01:40:00,119
and ask Congress to send me a bill

2401
01:39:57,360 --> 01:40:03,920
prohibiting child sexual

2402
01:40:00,119 --> 01:40:07,280
mutilation in all 50 states on day one I

2403
01:40:03,920 --> 01:40:10,280
will revoke Joe Biden's cruel policies

2404
01:40:07,280 --> 01:40:12,679
on so-called gender affirming care

2405
01:40:10,280 --> 01:40:15,080
ridiculous I will sign a new executive

2406
01:40:12,679 --> 01:40:18,000
order instructing every Federal agency

2407
01:40:15,080 --> 01:40:21,320
to cease all programs that promote the

2408
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:24,000
concept of sex and gender transition at

2409
01:40:21,320 --> 01:40:26,239
any age a few gender critical

2410
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:29,239
still want to insist they have nothing

2411
01:40:26,239 --> 01:40:31,080
to do with right-wing anti-trans vots

2412
01:40:29,239 --> 01:40:33,000
like Helen Lewis I mean Turf is

2413
01:40:31,080 --> 01:40:34,960
basically witch who attempts in her

2414
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:36,639
interview in The Witch Trials of JK

2415
01:40:34,960 --> 01:40:39,440
Rowling to distinguish between the

2416
01:40:36,639 --> 01:40:41,520
transphobia of the far right and that of

2417
01:40:39,440 --> 01:40:42,920
feminists I think the hardest thing for

2418
01:40:41,520 --> 01:40:45,360
Outsiders to understand is that there

2419
01:40:42,920 --> 01:40:47,360
are two different arguments going on one

2420
01:40:45,360 --> 01:40:50,400
is the traditional conservative right

2421
01:40:47,360 --> 01:40:52,719
argument which is anti-lgbt the other

2422
01:40:50,400 --> 01:40:53,760
one is a criticism from the left in

2423
01:40:52,719 --> 01:40:56,679
which it says

2424
01:40:53,760 --> 01:40:58,760
say sometimes male people and female

2425
01:40:56,679 --> 01:41:00,880
people have different interests no

2426
01:40:58,760 --> 01:41:03,480
matter how the male people identify but

2427
01:41:00,880 --> 01:41:05,520
as a transperson I don't care whether

2428
01:41:03,480 --> 01:41:07,920
you justify your transphobia in the name

2429
01:41:05,520 --> 01:41:10,040
of protecting women or protecting

2430
01:41:07,920 --> 01:41:11,520
children whether it's radical feminist

2431
01:41:10,040 --> 01:41:13,920
Janice Raymond calling for

2432
01:41:11,520 --> 01:41:16,239
transsexualism to be morally mandated

2433
01:41:13,920 --> 01:41:18,280
out of existence or conservative

2434
01:41:16,239 --> 01:41:20,560
Catholic Michael noes calling for

2435
01:41:18,280 --> 01:41:22,800
transgenderism to be eradicated from

2436
01:41:20,560 --> 01:41:25,639
public life is the same repulsive

2437
01:41:22,800 --> 01:41:27,960
bigotry to me and in any case the gender

2438
01:41:25,639 --> 01:41:30,280
critical movement has recently reached

2439
01:41:27,960 --> 01:41:32,840
an implicit consensus that they're

2440
01:41:30,280 --> 01:41:35,000
mostly done pretending to be feminist

2441
01:41:32,840 --> 01:41:38,639
the rising star of the movement posie

2442
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:41,360
Parker AKA Kelly J Kean Mitchell rejects

2443
01:41:38,639 --> 01:41:43,679
feminism entirely do you call yourself a

2444
01:41:41,360 --> 01:41:45,760
femous now did you ever call yourself a

2445
01:41:43,679 --> 01:41:47,880
I probably did for a short time but so

2446
01:41:45,760 --> 01:41:50,000
you wouldn't be so like a Julie bindle

2447
01:41:47,880 --> 01:41:52,119
type feminist no well some feminists I

2448
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:54,440
mean Julie bindle has been critical of

2449
01:41:52,119 --> 01:41:56,320
um mothers in the past and I think

2450
01:41:54,440 --> 01:41:59,000
that's a that's a theme flowing through

2451
01:41:56,320 --> 01:42:02,520
feminism I'm not a feminist I'm not a

2452
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:05,159
feminist this is not Andrea dworin this

2453
01:42:02,520 --> 01:42:07,679
is Phyllis schafle Parker's campaign is

2454
01:42:05,159 --> 01:42:09,840
currently funded by the right-wing CPAC

2455
01:42:07,679 --> 01:42:12,040
CPAC came along and said that they would

2456
01:42:09,840 --> 01:42:15,360
sponsor our events and cover all of our

2457
01:42:12,040 --> 01:42:17,920
insurance throughout our whole trip uh

2458
01:42:15,360 --> 01:42:19,880
which is really kind of them um but what

2459
01:42:17,920 --> 01:42:21,400
we would need to do is we would need to

2460
01:42:19,880 --> 01:42:24,000
show that we were working for them

2461
01:42:21,400 --> 01:42:25,639
working with them she had has no qualms

2462
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:27,800
about collaborating with far-right

2463
01:42:25,639 --> 01:42:29,960
weight nationalists I want to talk about

2464
01:42:27,800 --> 01:42:31,159
Marjorie Taylor green let me tell you

2465
01:42:29,960 --> 01:42:34,800
what she's been saying she's a

2466
01:42:31,159 --> 01:42:36,719
republican but she uh I agree with her

2467
01:42:34,800 --> 01:42:39,280
wholeheartedly she's opposed abortion

2468
01:42:36,719 --> 01:42:44,639
and contraception for teenagers why are

2469
01:42:39,280 --> 01:42:46,320
we enabling um children to take um

2470
01:42:44,639 --> 01:42:50,960
sometimes contraceptives that that are

2471
01:42:46,320 --> 01:42:53,360
quite harmful or access to abortion um I

2472
01:42:50,960 --> 01:42:55,840
think that we really need to rethink all

2473
01:42:53,360 --> 01:42:57,440
of this I think parents need to take

2474
01:42:55,840 --> 01:43:00,400
back control of their children she's

2475
01:42:57,440 --> 01:43:04,480
called trans people fools and perverts

2476
01:43:00,400 --> 01:43:06,480
transgenderism is nuts it's for fools

2477
01:43:04,480 --> 01:43:09,280
and perverts she's denied that

2478
01:43:06,480 --> 01:43:11,280
transgender is a legitimate concept it's

2479
01:43:09,280 --> 01:43:13,000
not a real thing there's no such thing

2480
01:43:11,280 --> 01:43:14,440
as being born in the wrong body there's

2481
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:16,679
no such thing as a trans woman there's

2482
01:43:14,440 --> 01:43:19,040
no such thing as a trans person there is

2483
01:43:16,679 --> 01:43:21,239
no such thing there are people that call

2484
01:43:19,040 --> 01:43:24,119
themselves these things that may have

2485
01:43:21,239 --> 01:43:26,000
other issues manifest ing that then make

2486
01:43:24,119 --> 01:43:28,920
them think they're this but no we have

2487
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:30,520
to stop using any words like transgender

2488
01:43:28,920 --> 01:43:32,199
um you know there may be more words that

2489
01:43:30,520 --> 01:43:34,560
we have to say in order to say that we

2490
01:43:32,199 --> 01:43:36,440
may call it transgender ideology uh but

2491
01:43:34,560 --> 01:43:38,760
when it comes to a person they may be

2492
01:43:36,440 --> 01:43:40,800
following transgender ideology but they

2493
01:43:38,760 --> 01:43:43,239
are not transgender there is no such

2494
01:43:40,800 --> 01:43:45,400
thing as a man or a woman being anything

2495
01:43:43,239 --> 01:43:48,080
other than a man or a woman she's called

2496
01:43:45,400 --> 01:43:50,400
trans women pedophiles we know that if a

2497
01:43:48,080 --> 01:43:55,080
man has a paraphilia of dressing as a

2498
01:43:50,400 --> 01:43:57,920
woman the most likely cross par pilia is

2499
01:43:55,080 --> 01:44:00,880
pedophilia we know that these men have

2500
01:43:57,920 --> 01:44:03,119
multiple paraphilia they don't ever stop

2501
01:44:00,880 --> 01:44:05,719
at one she said that each and every

2502
01:44:03,119 --> 01:44:07,960
woman who stands in her way will be

2503
01:44:05,719 --> 01:44:10,840
annihilated each and every one of you

2504
01:44:07,960 --> 01:44:13,560
women who stand in my way each and every

2505
01:44:10,840 --> 01:44:16,320
one of you let me just tell you you will

2506
01:44:13,560 --> 01:44:18,719
be annihilated she's called on armed men

2507
01:44:16,320 --> 01:44:21,639
to enter women's restrooms to attack

2508
01:44:18,719 --> 01:44:24,080
anyone they perceive as not a real woman

2509
01:44:21,639 --> 01:44:25,840
and men for one

2510
01:44:24,080 --> 01:44:31,159
I'm talking to

2511
01:44:25,840 --> 01:44:33,920
you I'm talking about you dads who maybe

2512
01:44:31,159 --> 01:44:35,920
carry I think that's what you say uh I'm

2513
01:44:33,920 --> 01:44:38,679
so down with the American lingo maybe

2514
01:44:35,920 --> 01:44:41,000
you carry maybe you don't uh maybe you

2515
01:44:38,679 --> 01:44:43,639
consider yourself a protector of women

2516
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:45,880
maybe you're that sort of man um maybe

2517
01:44:43,639 --> 01:44:48,320
you have a daughter or a mother or a

2518
01:44:45,880 --> 01:44:49,880
wife uh maybe you have a sister maybe

2519
01:44:48,320 --> 01:44:52,440
you just have some friends maybe you

2520
01:44:49,880 --> 01:44:55,320
just think women are human and you don't

2521
01:44:52,440 --> 01:44:57,920
need any absolute connection with them

2522
01:44:55,320 --> 01:45:01,480
to feel compelled to protect

2523
01:44:57,920 --> 01:45:04,080
us um I think you should start using

2524
01:45:01,480 --> 01:45:06,920
women's toilets men and she said that

2525
01:45:04,080 --> 01:45:09,119
women who call themselves men should be

2526
01:45:06,920 --> 01:45:12,480
sterilized which seems to be a little

2527
01:45:09,119 --> 01:45:15,400
bit in tension with JK Ring's concern

2528
01:45:12,480 --> 01:45:16,719
about the fertility of confused girls

2529
01:45:15,400 --> 01:45:18,840
you know you might look at these

2530
01:45:16,719 --> 01:45:21,520
differences of opinion between Rowling

2531
01:45:18,840 --> 01:45:24,080
and Parker little things like pro-

2532
01:45:21,520 --> 01:45:26,679
feminist versus anti- feminist left

2533
01:45:24,080 --> 01:45:29,480
versus right pro-abortion versus

2534
01:45:26,679 --> 01:45:32,280
anti-abortion concern about trans men's

2535
01:45:29,480 --> 01:45:35,040
fertility versus advocating forced

2536
01:45:32,280 --> 01:45:37,400
sterilization of trans men against

2537
01:45:35,040 --> 01:45:41,520
annihilating women who stand in your way

2538
01:45:37,400 --> 01:45:44,119
versus Pro annihilating each and every

2539
01:45:41,520 --> 01:45:45,800
woman who stands in your way you might

2540
01:45:44,119 --> 01:45:48,119
look at these differences and expect

2541
01:45:45,800 --> 01:45:50,080
that these two women would be at odds

2542
01:45:48,119 --> 01:45:53,040
but they aren't because promoting

2543
01:45:50,080 --> 01:45:56,400
anti-trans bigotry is a common cause

2544
01:45:53,040 --> 01:45:58,920
that for both of them trumps all else in

2545
01:45:56,400 --> 01:46:01,800
2020 posie Parker paid for a poster

2546
01:45:58,920 --> 01:46:04,080
reading ihart JK rolling to be displayed

2547
01:46:01,800 --> 01:46:06,599
at a railway station in Edinburgh and

2548
01:46:04,080 --> 01:46:09,119
Rowling has tweeted in defense of Parker

2549
01:46:06,599 --> 01:46:12,840
numerous times and has modeled her

2550
01:46:09,119 --> 01:46:15,199
t-shirts so the gender critical movement

2551
01:46:12,840 --> 01:46:18,159
started by lesbian separatists in the

2552
01:46:15,199 --> 01:46:20,840
1970s has finally passed into the hands

2553
01:46:18,159 --> 01:46:22,920
of pound shop Ava Browns as gender

2554
01:46:20,840 --> 01:46:25,280
critical lesbian Julie bindle met

2555
01:46:22,920 --> 01:46:28,119
memorably described them it's a movement

2556
01:46:25,280 --> 01:46:30,440
that has no beliefs apart from a shared

2557
01:46:28,119 --> 01:46:32,280
determination to reduce the number of

2558
01:46:30,440 --> 01:46:34,040
trans people in the numbers we're

2559
01:46:32,280 --> 01:46:37,040
currently seeing particularly of young

2560
01:46:34,040 --> 01:46:39,880
people coming forward I find cause for

2561
01:46:37,040 --> 01:46:41,080
doubt in the meantime why why we're

2562
01:46:39,880 --> 01:46:43,880
trying to get through to the decision

2563
01:46:41,080 --> 01:46:46,400
makers we have to try to limit the harm

2564
01:46:43,880 --> 01:46:48,000
and that means reducing or keeping down

2565
01:46:46,400 --> 01:46:50,760
the number of people who transition and

2566
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:52,080
that's for two reasons one of them is

2567
01:46:50,760 --> 01:46:54,159
that every one of those people is a

2568
01:46:52,080 --> 01:46:56,000
person who's been damaged

2569
01:46:54,159 --> 01:46:59,040
but the second one is every one of those

2570
01:46:56,000 --> 01:47:01,360
people is

2571
01:46:59,040 --> 01:47:03,520
basically you know a huge problem to a

2572
01:47:01,360 --> 01:47:04,719
sane world like if you've got people

2573
01:47:03,520 --> 01:47:05,880
that and whether they're transitioned

2574
01:47:04,719 --> 01:47:07,119
whether they're happily transitioned

2575
01:47:05,880 --> 01:47:08,880
whether they're unhappily transitioned

2576
01:47:07,119 --> 01:47:10,360
whether they''re detransitioned if

2577
01:47:08,880 --> 01:47:13,239
you've got people who've dissociated

2578
01:47:10,360 --> 01:47:14,400
from their sex in some way every one of

2579
01:47:13,239 --> 01:47:17,199
those people is someone who needs

2580
01:47:14,400 --> 01:47:19,520
special accommodation in a sane world

2581
01:47:17,199 --> 01:47:22,639
where we Rea knowledge the the truth of

2582
01:47:19,520 --> 01:47:25,400
sex so to wrap this up is the backlash

2583
01:47:22,639 --> 01:47:28,880
against against JK rolling a Witch

2584
01:47:25,400 --> 01:47:31,719
Hunt unequivocally no it's very

2585
01:47:28,880 --> 01:47:33,760
thoroughly deserved but I will say this

2586
01:47:31,719 --> 01:47:36,080
a movement can't get along without a

2587
01:47:33,760 --> 01:47:39,119
devil and across the whole political

2588
01:47:36,080 --> 01:47:41,639
Spectrum there's a misogynistic tendency

2589
01:47:39,119 --> 01:47:44,719
to choose a female devil whether it's

2590
01:47:41,639 --> 01:47:48,480
Anita Bryant Hillary Clinton Marie

2591
01:47:44,719 --> 01:47:50,480
Antoinette Alexandria oazo Cortez or JK

2592
01:47:48,480 --> 01:47:52,880
Rowling and there's always going to be

2593
01:47:50,480 --> 01:47:56,800
people who seize on any opportunity to

2594
01:47:52,880 --> 01:47:59,239
be misogynistic so I would advise trans

2595
01:47:56,800 --> 01:48:02,520
people and our allies to keep in mind

2596
01:47:59,239 --> 01:48:05,360
that JK Rowling is not the final boss of

2597
01:48:02,520 --> 01:48:07,719
transphobia she's not our devil the

2598
01:48:05,360 --> 01:48:10,000
devil is the Republican Party the

2599
01:48:07,719 --> 01:48:12,520
conservative party the devil is

2600
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:14,760
patriarchy it's the right-wing men who

2601
01:48:12,520 --> 01:48:18,320
will be the ones to put gender critical

2602
01:48:14,760 --> 01:48:21,400
theory into brutal practice Anita Bryant

2603
01:48:18,320 --> 01:48:23,320
posie Parker and JK Rowling are to

2604
01:48:21,400 --> 01:48:25,280
borrow a term from turf

2605
01:48:23,320 --> 01:48:27,639
handmaidens turfs are the real

2606
01:48:25,280 --> 01:48:30,119
handmaidens they're useful idiots who

2607
01:48:27,639 --> 01:48:32,080
put a concerned female face on the

2608
01:48:30,119 --> 01:48:34,320
patriarchal violence against trans

2609
01:48:32,080 --> 01:48:37,639
people that will ultimately be enacted

2610
01:48:34,320 --> 01:48:40,239
by right-wing men I call on men to

2611
01:48:37,639 --> 01:48:42,920
consider themselves decent human beings

2612
01:48:40,239 --> 01:48:45,760
to call out the Deviant among them and

2613
01:48:42,920 --> 01:48:48,520
eradicate these monsters from

2614
01:48:45,760 --> 01:48:51,560
society and Megan Phelps Roper and

2615
01:48:48,520 --> 01:48:53,560
centrists like her are wrong that civil

2616
01:48:51,560 --> 01:48:56,520
conversation can

2617
01:48:53,560 --> 01:48:59,400
this call out the among them and

2618
01:48:56,520 --> 01:49:02,199
eradicate these monsters from

2619
01:48:59,400 --> 01:49:05,599
society people like Michael nolles and

2620
01:49:02,199 --> 01:49:08,760
Ronda santis and Donald Trump cannot be

2621
01:49:05,599 --> 01:49:12,599
persuaded they have to be defeated as

2622
01:49:08,760 --> 01:49:15,040
for what to do about JK ring honestly

2623
01:49:12,599 --> 01:49:17,159
let's all just block her open up Twitter

2624
01:49:15,040 --> 01:49:19,800
right now go to her profile and just

2625
01:49:17,159 --> 01:49:22,400
block her problem solved like don't

2626
01:49:19,800 --> 01:49:24,280
harass her that doesn't help but also I

2627
01:49:22,400 --> 01:49:26,159
wouldn't wait for her to change she's

2628
01:49:24,280 --> 01:49:28,400
gone down what I call the bigotry

2629
01:49:26,159 --> 01:49:30,239
Whirlpool the deeper you go in the

2630
01:49:28,400 --> 01:49:32,239
harder it is to leave for the same

2631
01:49:30,239 --> 01:49:35,119
reasons that it's hard to quit a cult or

2632
01:49:32,239 --> 01:49:37,040
scam to quote video essayist Dan Olen

2633
01:49:35,119 --> 01:49:39,360
one of the most Insidious elements of a

2634
01:49:37,040 --> 01:49:41,719
confidence scam is that the victims who

2635
01:49:39,360 --> 01:49:44,560
invested the most are often the most

2636
01:49:41,719 --> 01:49:46,480
passionate Defenders because shame is a

2637
01:49:44,560 --> 01:49:48,400
powerful force in the human psyche and

2638
01:49:46,480 --> 01:49:50,400
they can't bear the shame of admitting

2639
01:49:48,400 --> 01:49:52,320
they were tricked reformed bigots have

2640
01:49:50,400 --> 01:49:53,199
to face not only the shame of being

2641
01:49:52,320 --> 01:49:54,960
duped

2642
01:49:53,199 --> 01:49:57,040
but also the guilt of having devoted

2643
01:49:54,960 --> 01:49:59,320
years of life to harming vulnerable

2644
01:49:57,040 --> 01:50:01,960
people this is something Megan to her

2645
01:49:59,320 --> 01:50:04,119
credit faced head on if we were wrong

2646
01:50:01,960 --> 01:50:06,840
then I had spent every day of my life

2647
01:50:04,119 --> 01:50:10,000
industriously sewing Doom Discord and

2648
01:50:06,840 --> 01:50:12,679
rage to so many not at the beest of God

2649
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:14,840
but of my grandfather I had wasted my

2650
01:50:12,679 --> 01:50:18,000
life only to fill others with pain and

2651
01:50:14,840 --> 01:50:20,440
misery most bigots cannot stand to face

2652
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:22,719
this moral sunk cost it's why an

2653
01:50:20,440 --> 01:50:24,360
obsessive bigot like Graham linahan who

2654
01:50:22,719 --> 01:50:26,480
whose allc consuming hatred of trans

2655
01:50:24,360 --> 01:50:28,840
people has ruined his life caused him

2656
01:50:26,480 --> 01:50:31,159
his marriage and left him alone to tweet

2657
01:50:28,840 --> 01:50:33,520
about destroying gender ideology minutes

2658
01:50:31,159 --> 01:50:36,000
before midnight on New Year's Eve feels

2659
01:50:33,520 --> 01:50:38,000
psychologically compelled to insist with

2660
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:40,239
ever more certainty that trans people

2661
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:43,199
are not just delusional or dangerous but

2662
01:50:40,239 --> 01:50:45,520
are all demonic perverts an enemy so

2663
01:50:43,199 --> 01:50:47,480
hyperbolically evil that they justify

2664
01:50:45,520 --> 01:50:50,920
his self- ulating

2665
01:50:47,480 --> 01:50:53,320
crued they took everything from me you

2666
01:50:50,920 --> 01:50:56,440
know they took my

2667
01:50:53,320 --> 01:50:58,400
he took my f my family you know I just

2668
01:50:56,440 --> 01:51:02,800
said no hang on a sec stop calling these

2669
01:50:58,400 --> 01:51:06,560
women turfs stop sending them abuse let

2670
01:51:02,800 --> 01:51:08,880
them speak and for that they they just

2671
01:51:06,560 --> 01:51:11,320
destroyed me do you honestly feel

2672
01:51:08,880 --> 01:51:12,960
destroyed no because because the one

2673
01:51:11,320 --> 01:51:15,040
thing about this the one thing about

2674
01:51:12,960 --> 01:51:17,920
this that keeps me going is that I know

2675
01:51:15,040 --> 01:51:19,880
I'm right you know I know I'm right as

2676
01:51:17,920 --> 01:51:22,199
long as he stays here in the bottom of

2677
01:51:19,880 --> 01:51:24,280
the whirlpool he never has to face that

2678
01:51:22,199 --> 01:51:26,360
he's ruined his relationships and Wasted

2679
01:51:24,280 --> 01:51:29,280
Years of life because he just couldn't

2680
01:51:26,360 --> 01:51:33,199
let it go and if JK rolling doesn't log

2681
01:51:29,280 --> 01:51:35,360
off soon this will likely be her fate as

2682
01:51:33,199 --> 01:51:38,719
well I guess what I'm really trying to

2683
01:51:35,360 --> 01:51:42,280
say is Harry Potter is dead to me I'm

2684
01:51:38,719 --> 01:51:42,280
switching to Twilight

2685
01:51:52,770 --> 01:55:00,120
[Music]

2686
01:55:01,920 --> 01:55:05,360
at least it's a fruit pie
