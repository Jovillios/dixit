00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,840
excuse me what about the alt left they

5
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,240
came charging at the

6
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,199
as you say the alt-right do they have

00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,320
any

semblance of guilt a local world war ii

veteran wants you to hear and see this

10
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,719
next story because he's worried

11
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,920
what he fought against so long ago is

12
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:39,680
making a comeback

13
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:45,760
here in the united states he believes

00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:48,399
what happened

15
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:50,620
hi in this video i'm going to talk about

16
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:55,600
how to recognize a fascist

17
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:57,600
[Music]

18
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,960
to begin let's take a look at what

19
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,280
fascism is

20
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,320
contemporary fascists share three core

21
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,799
beliefs

22
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,720
one people of european heritage are

23
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,560
ought to constitute a biological

24
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,960
cultural and political unity known as

25
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,640
the white race sometimes dog-whistled as

26
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,560
western culture

27
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,159
two jews are masterminding the

28
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,759
destruction of the white race through

29
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,560
multiculturalism and non-white

30
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,200
immigration

31
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,960
a plot that fascists call white genocide

32
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,880
or ethnic replacement

33
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:27,200
three the only way to save the white

34
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:29,520
race is to establish a white homeland

35
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,439
or ethno state from which non-whites and

36
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,520
degenerates must be purged

37
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:35,360
now as i've argued in past videos all

38
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:37,040
three of these beliefs are false

39
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,479
so what is it that's attracting people

40
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,479
to fascism well

41
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:41,680
let's take a look at a contemporary nazi

43
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:47,920
and see if we can figure that out

44
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,920
who are you

45
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:52,399
i'm not talking about your name or your

46
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:54,720
occupation

47
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:56,399
i'm talking about something bigger

48
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,560
something deeper

49
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:59,600
i'm talking about your connection to a

50
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,520

a history a destiny

52
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:08,319
our ancestors had a very strong sense of

53
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:11,599
their identity

54
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:15,200
they could say i'm a roman

00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:17,599

the vikings dead

00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,160

00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,879
or a briton or

71
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:51,680
german or any european nationality is

72
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:55,200
about being dedicated to a collection

73
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:59,800
of abstractions and buzzwords

74
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:03,440
democracy freedom tolerance

75
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:06,480
multiculturalism but a nation

76
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,959
based on freedom is just another place

77
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,319
to go

78
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:12,800
shopping so life

79
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:14,959
is basically sad and in capitalist

80
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,920
society that sadness is a sense of

81
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:17,760
isolation

82
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:20,480
and anxiety that there's nothing more to

83
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:22,800
life than acquiring 1990s collector's

slim jim beersteins until you die

86
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,879
fortunately thanks to fascism you don't

87
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,040
have to

88
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:32,400
fascism promises you apart in something

89
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,799
greater than yourself

90
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,720
a homeland for your people a sense of

91
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,040
belonging to a tradition that stretches

92
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,200
back

93
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:41,760
thousands of years and as far into the

94
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,680
future just be sure to be extra proud of

95
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,760
the parts of your heritage that involve

96
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,920
buying and selling other human beings as

97
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:50,080
property the most basic way to resist

98
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,040
fascism is to recognize its propaganda

99
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,959
for what it is

100
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,480
the idea that appreciating european

101
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:56,720
culture is in some way linked to

102
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,680
establishing a white ethnostate is just

103
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,840
nonsense

104
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,400
your enjoyment of beethoven or white

105
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:04,879
babies or whatever it is you get off to

106
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,640
is in no way impeded by the proximity of

107
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:07,439
people with different skin colors and

108
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,519
traditions

109
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:12,000
and it certainly does not require nation

110
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:13,360
culture and geographic ancestry to all

111
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,280
become the same thing

112
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,959
but in order to recognize fascism you

113
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,479
need to do a lot more than reject the

114
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,320
most overt propaganda

115
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:22,000
in the wake of the disastrous alt-right

116
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,400
rally in charlottesville earlier this

117
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,160
month

118
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,080
the nazis have been driven back into the

119
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,600
shadows at least two of their major

120
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,360
websites were shut down

121
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,360
confederate monuments were removed all

122
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,400
over the country and several prominent

123
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,560
fascists have begun

124
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,520
backpedaling none of this means fascists

125
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,800
will go away

126
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,880
it just means they'll have to be more

127
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,080
subtle and indirect shortly after the

128
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,080
charlottesville rally

129
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,199
a post titled fixing the alt-right

130
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,960
appeared on pole

131
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:47,040
the image board where millennial nazis

132
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:49,199
talk strategy and trade pictures of

133
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,360
japanese nymphats

134
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,479
the post outlines some basic fascist

135
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,400
strategy

136
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:56,000
don't get trapped in an echo chamber

137
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,960
where you can no longer relate to

138
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,720
normies

139
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,800
pretending that charlottesville didn't

140
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,199
massively push the average white person

141
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,000
away

142
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:05,759
is really stupid we have a chance to

143
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,840
actually make changes now that trump has

144
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:09,759
shifted the overton window to the right

145
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,080
but we need to be smart and make the

146
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,039
movement appealing to the average white

147
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,600
person

148
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:16,479
and the way to do that is disavow all

149
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,919
nazi

150
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:21,600
kkk edgelord larpers there is no way to

151
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:23,759
lose public support quicker than going

152
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,080
around making nazi salutes and holding

153
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:27,600
tiki torches while chanting jews will

154
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:30,080
not replace us

155
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,039
this instantly makes the average person

156
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,840
hate you

157
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:34,800
build a populist movement with realistic

158
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:38,160
incremental

159
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:40,000
overt goals repealing the 1965

160
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,759
immigration act and replacing it with

161
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,600
something that both limits total

162
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:46,400
immigration and prioritizes

163
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,840
white immigration is an actual tangible

164
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,400
political goal

165
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:52,880
keep the long-term goals covert and

166
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:55,759
don't ever reveal your power level

167
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:57,919
talking openly about a white ethno state

168
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:59,919
only leads to failure and the average

169
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:02,400
public turning against you

170
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:03,120
so disavow anyone who reveals his power

171
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,759
level

172
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,280
leftists will recognize dog whistles and

173
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:09,919
nowhere crypto

174
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,600
but normies won't listen to them so at

175
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:13,759
first glance this seems like a really

176
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,120
silly juvenile post that references

177
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,960
dragon ball z

178
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,479
but it actually displays a sense of

179
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,560
realistic pragmatism

180
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:22,319
and an incremental approach to long-term

181
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,960
goals that i wish were more common on

182
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,639
the left

183
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,720
but of course the strategy described

184
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,319
here isn't new older generations of

185
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,720
white supremacists have been doing this

186
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:32,160
stuff for decades when overt racism is

187
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,080
politically unacceptable

188
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,840
politicians have to use coded language

189
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,919
in order to appeal to racists

190
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,520
republican strategist lee atwater

191
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:40,880
explained the technique in an interview

192
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:44,720
in 1981.

193
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:48,000
you start out in 1954 by saying

194
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:50,880
by 1968 you can't say that hurts

195
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,919
you backfires so you say stuff like

196
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,080
force bussing

197
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:56,080
states rights and all that stuff you're

198
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:58,240
getting so abstract now that

199
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,599
you're talking about cutting taxes and

200
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,000
all these things that you're talking

201
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:03,280
about are totally economic things and a

202
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,599
byproduct of them

203
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,400
is that blacks get hurt worse than

204
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:08,160
whites

205
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,080
so if you want to recognize a fascist

206
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,599
you have to know how to read subtext and

207
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:14,319
how to hear dog whistles

208
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:16,560
because 99 times out of 100 a fascist

209
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:17,520
will disavow fascism racism and white

210
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,199
supremacy

211
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,680
at least when talking to you a

212
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:23,520
non-fascist rallies with swastikas and

213
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,759
nazi salutes are the exception

214
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,639
not the rule fascists are more likely to

215
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:28,319
gain traction

216
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:30,560
and are hence more dangerous when they

217
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,840
use subtler tactics so for the rest of

218
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,919
this video i'll be describing the

219
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,199
particular strategies that fascists use

220
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:36,720
to code their ideas

221
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:39,280
and make them more palatable to

222
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:41,919
conservatives centrists and liberals

223
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:43,360
strategy one outright denial never

224
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:45,280
reveal your power level

225
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,120
disavow anyone who reveals their power

226
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,080
level this means that if someone acts

227
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,319
like a fascist

228
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,199
has fascist beliefs repeats fascist

229
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:53,039
talking points

230
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:54,639
and hangs out with other fascists the

231
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:56,479
fact that they publicly denounce

232
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:58,479
fascism should be worth absolutely

233
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:59,840
nothing to you and shouldn't even enter

234
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:01,120
into your consideration of whether

235
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:04,160
they're a fascist

236
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:06,479
after all i'm not a fascist is exactly

237
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:10,000
what a fascist would say

238
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:10,720
strategy 2 euphemism of course i'm not a

239
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,720
fascist

240
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:15,360
i'm an alternative ethno-nationalist

241
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,960
simply trying to preserve western values

242
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,639
fascists constantly shift their

243
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,240
terminology in order to avoid the

244
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:21,599
negative connotations that develop

245
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,039
around the names of their movements

246
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:23,840
whenever people figure out what they

247
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,520
really are

248
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:28,080
so they insist they are nazis or white

249
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:30,080
supremacists just white nationalists or

250
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,599
alt-right but as people catch on to the

251
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,760
fact that white nationalists and the

252
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:35,200
alt-right are just nazis they'll shift

253
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,959
their terminology again

254
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,039
and start telling you i'm not a white

255
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:41,120
nationalist i'm an identitarian

256
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:42,800
or whatever the next thing is but it's

257
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,240
still the same bastards they're just

258
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:46,000
using a different name

259
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,440
they'll also use euphemisms for core

260
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,440
components of their beliefs

261
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,440
if talking about preserving a homeland

262
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,200
for white people sounds too fascist

263
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,360
they'll talk about preserving western

264
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,360
civilization or western culture

265
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,200
instead if the phrase white genocide

266
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,959
discredits them they'll say ethnic

267
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,480
replacement instead and if it's

268
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:03,839
considered hate speech to advocate

269
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,440
purging non-white people

270
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:07,360
they'll talk instead about purging

271
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,160
immigrants criminals rapists and

272
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,680
terrorists

273
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,680
and leave it to the audience to catch

274
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:15,279
the color coding on their own

275
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:16,160
strategy 3 pedentry it's absurd to call

276
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:18,080
me a nazi

277
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:20,800
the german national socialist party

278
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,080
hasn't existed since 1945.

279
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,560
that's right and i bet he's an

280
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,680
isolationist too not an expansionist

281
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,519
like the nazis

282
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,920
fascists use this kind of selective

283
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:31,760
pedantry to dodge derogatory labels

284
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,680
and also to bog you down in a petty

285
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,800
terminological dispute this is a good

286
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,480
way to waste your time

287
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,160
divert your attention away from whatever

288
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,640
led you to call them a nazi in the first

289
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,560
place

290
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,399
i'm not a white supremacist i don't

291
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,040
think that whites are superior to other

292
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:45,200
races

293
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,399
i simply think we deserve a homeland of

294
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,959
our own as

295
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:50,480
do all peoples there it is again and

296
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:52,640
next he's going to tell us that since

297
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,120
asians have the highest iqs he's if

298
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,279
anything

299
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,120
an asian supremacist and then you'll get

300
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:58,720
sucked into arguing about iq

301
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,160
instead of talking about the fact that

302
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,880
the main goal of the politics he

303
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,959
supports

304
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,000
is the political and social supremacy of

305
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:06,079
white people over all

306
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,320
other americans and europeans in other

307
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:11,680
words white supremacy

308
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:13,440
strategy four secret symbols nazis have

309
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,959
always taken an interest in occult

310
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,120
symbols like the black sun

311
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:19,440
on fritz's ring more like the swastika

312
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:21,519
itself but more obscure symbols can be

313
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,600
useful as a kind of secret handshake

314
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:25,519
that lets nazis recognize each other

315
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,360
without normies taking notice

316
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:28,800
the best symbols to use for this purpose

317
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,320
are ones that are not primarily

318
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,240
associated with fascism

319
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,560
or at least have some other meaning such

320
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:36,399
as the athala rune or the iron cross

321
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,920
better still are symbols that until

322
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:40,320
adoption by fascists

323
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:42,399
are completely innocuous modern fascists

324
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,480
have taken to using almost arbitrary

325
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:45,040
emoji as a way to wink and nod at each

326
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,079
other

327
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:50,240
notably the frog after pepe the milk

328
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:51,600
and the okay sign so it doesn't matter

329
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,360
what the symbols are

330
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,360
in fact it's important that the symbols

331
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,000
constantly change so that normies don't

332
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,519
catch on

333
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,120
by the time you watch this video they

334
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:59,760
probably won't even be using the frog

335
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,640
anymore

336
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:04,399
maybe it'll be this or this the only way

337
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:06,160
to find out is to watch fascists

338
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:07,600
carefully and see what symbols they use

339
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,440
to identify themselves

340
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,720
and of course another advantage of using

341
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,399
innocuous symbols

342
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,800
is that when leftists try to point those

343
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:17,519
symbols out the fascists can always say

344
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,240
these gullible sjws now think that even

345
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,560
the okay

346
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,240
sign is racist is there anything they

347
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:24,240
don't think is racist

348
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,360
and the gullible centrists will be taken

349
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,440
right in

350
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,800
the poor centrists they're so afraid

351
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,800
that antifa is going to punch them

352
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,880
because of their hair or their emoji

353
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,920
and you know some leftists are [ __ ]

354
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,760
or idiots so

355
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,959
i should say you should never assume

356
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,880
someone is a fascist

357
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:40,320
just because of their hair or because of

358
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,399
the emoji they use

359
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:44,399
these are only little pieces of a larger

360
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:45,040
puzzle but white centrists also need to

361
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,880
understand

362
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:48,640
that the way you feel about antifa

363
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,639
political rallies oh god what if they

364
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,079
profile me and attack me unfairly

365
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:53,839
that's how a lot of black people feel

366
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:55,600
about the police all the time

367
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:57,839
and the fascists whose free speech you

368
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,519
defend so often are trying to drum up

369
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:01,279
exactly the sentiments that make the

370
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:02,880
police dangerous to black people

371
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:04,880
and that make it dangerous for queer

372
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,720
people to be themselves in public

373
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:08,880
so i hope that's something you think

374
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,720
about anyway it's not that the ok

375
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:12,240
sign is inherently racist or that anyone

376
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:14,399
who uses it is racist

377
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,480
and in fact it's its very innocuousness

378
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:18,399
that makes it useful as a cryptofascist

379
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,160
wink and nudge but the misunderstanding

380
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:21,519
about calling these little things racist

381
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:24,880
sets the stage for

382
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:27,279
strategy 5 camaraderie of the accused

383
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:29,200
the left accuses everyone of racism they

384
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:31,120
think all white people are nazis

385
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,720
if it's acceptable to attack and censor

386
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:35,120
me they'll come for you

387
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:37,040
next fascists have very effectively

388
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,480
exploited the general hostility towards

389
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:41,120
social justice warriors

390
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:43,200
especially online unfortunately not all

391
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,480
leftists have my connoisseur's eye for

392
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,240
detecting fascism

393
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,519
and some of them do throw the label at

394
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,440
centrists or liberals

395
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:50,720
this doesn't cause centrists to become

396
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,720
allied with fascists

397
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,880
history shows that happens regardless

398
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,880
but it can accelerate the process

399
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:58,399
lending some plausibility to the fear

400
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,480
that moderate centrists have

401
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:02,959
that anti-fascists will come after them

402
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,800
next it's tactically smart for fascists

403
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:06,399
to make the most of this situation

404
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,399
and use it to pump up sympathy and

405
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:12,320
solidarity from centrists

406
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:14,720
strategy six irony jokes satire

407
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,760
and meetings of course i wasn't actually

408
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,399
being racist

409
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:20,800
it was just an edgy meme can't anyone

410
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:23,040
take a joke anymore or will the antifa

411
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,920
fascists violently attack you over humor

412
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,680
now too

413
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,200
here's a uniquely millennial twist on

414
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,040
the racist dog whistle

415
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,800
you shroud your sincere ideas and

416
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:32,639
cartoon characters and memes

417
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,079
and then when called out you mock your

418
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:35,839
accuser for being a clueless

419
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:37,760
normie who isn't in on the joke

420
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:39,360
sometimes irony can be a safe way to

421
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,560
explore ideas that you're not quite

422
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,880
ready to own yet

423
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,720
before i realized i was transgender i

424
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,680
used to jump at any opportunity to

425
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,160
crossdress

426
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:49,519
ironically so when you see people joking

427
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,760
about being nazis

428
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:54,000
they could just be joking or they could

429
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,639
be using irony to partially conceal the

430
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,560
truth

431
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:58,000
it's difficult to tell the difference

432
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:00,079
and that's the point

433
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,519
but kekastan is just a satire of

434
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:04,480
identity politics

435
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:06,240
well it's a hilarious satire of civil

436
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,160
rights movements that just happens to

437
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,839
use a nazi battle flag

438
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,760
and while it may have been popularized

439
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:13,760
originally by god damn centrist

440
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:15,120
youtubers who are unable or unwilling to

441
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,000
see how helpful they're being to

442
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,440
fascists

443
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,199
kekistan became the perfect

444
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:22,240
pseudo-ironic pretext for

445
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:24,240
uh identitarians including the ones who

446
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:26,480
led the rally where an edgy [ __ ] poster

447
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,120
hilariously memed his car into a crowd

448
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,600
of people

449
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,959
no wonder the splc now describes it as a

450
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:34,399
hate symbol

451
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:37,279
those normie fools it's just a joke

452
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:39,279
strategy 7 shifting blame why doesn't

453
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:40,959
the mainstream media cover violent

454
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:43,519
anti-white organizations

455
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:46,240
like black lives matter or antifa this

456
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:47,680
is essentially just a two-co-que fallacy

457
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,760
especially heinous because of the

458
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:51,360
equivocation between fascist violence

459
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:53,360
and anti-fascist violence

460
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,440
and between white nationalism and black

461
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,600
civil rights the implication is that

462
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,279
activism to reduce urban poverty or

463
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,040
violence against black people

464
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:02,880
is just the mirror image of white

465
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,320
supremacist ethnic cleansing

466
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,639
shortly after the charlottesville

467
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:09,360
incident our proto-fascist president

468
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:11,440
called out antifa in the alt-left a term

469
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,320
fascists invented to distract liberals

470
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,920
and centrists

471
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,760
and establish the assumption that there

472
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,560
must be some leftist equivalent of the

473
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,399
alt-right

474
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:20,240
because if you have a word for a thing

475
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:22,160
that thing must exist

476
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,000
both sides rhetoric is useful to

477
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,959
fascists because it diverts attention

478
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,600
away from them

479
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:28,560
vilifies anti-fascists wins sympathy

480
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,079
from centrists

481
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,399
and helps to shift the center of

482
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:35,120
acceptable discourse in their direction

483
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:36,959
strategy eight incrementalism you don't

484
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,639
have to support a white ethnic state to

485
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:39,519
want common sense policies about

486
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:41,199
immigration

487
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,800
of course i don't support violence

488
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:43,279
against the non-white people already

489
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,880
here

490
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:46,800
but we do have a right to preserve our

491
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:48,399
boundaries in our culture don't we

492
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:51,040
the common thread in all fascist

493
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:52,720
strategies is deception and manipulation

494
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:54,480
often aimed at representing what is

495
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,040
essentially an attack on non-white

496
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,199
people

497
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:59,440
as a defense of white people in white

498
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:01,040
culture the fascist's long-term goal is

499
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:03,040
a homogeneous ethnostate

500
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:05,199
which at some point will require massive

501
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:07,120
ethnic cleansing of one kind or another

502
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:08,720
but of course they won't tell you about

503
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,519
that unless they think you're also a

504
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,440
fascist

505
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:12,880
the strategic fascist knows it's better

506
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:15,360
to start with realistic

507
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:17,759
achievable goals and that means focusing

508
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:19,600
first on stopping non-white immigration

509
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:21,519
something they'll try to get you the

510
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:24,000
centrist conservative or liberal

511
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:25,199
on board with by emphasizing the danger

512
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,440
and criminality

513
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:29,279
of non-white immigrants and refugees if

514
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,240
they can whip up enough racist sentiment

515
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:32,160
with that rhetoric

516
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,839
they can later turn that energy against

517
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,639
the non-white people who are already

518
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:37,680
here

519
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:39,600
strategy 9 the free speech defense

520
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:41,360
you may not agree with what i say but i

521
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,120
have just as much a right to speak and

522
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:45,440
assemble as anyone else

523
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,440
much of anti-fascist strategy involves

524
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:49,040
limiting fascists ability to publicly

525
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,959
recruit and intimidate

526
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:53,120
often by shutting down fascist marches

527
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:53,839
and rallies or by pressuring platforms

528
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,759
not to host

529
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:57,199
fascists the best way for the fascists

530
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:58,880
to oppose that strategy

531
00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:00,959
is to appeal to the liberal value of

532
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:02,800
free speech nothing tugs on those

533
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:05,039
classical liberal heartstrings like a

534
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:06,559
tale of woe about how unfairly silenced

535
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:08,799
you are but remember

536
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:10,480
fascists do not actually value freedom

537
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:13,039
democracy or diversity

538
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,600
they only value the race the people the

539
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:15,520
nation

540
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:17,120
their long-term goal is a society where

541
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,520
there is no room for anyone who isn't

542
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,520
white

543
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:22,000
or even anyone who isn't a fascist to

544
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:24,079
exist so you can begrudgingly concede to

545
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,240
fascists their constitutional freedoms

546
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:27,760
but remember you shouldn't expect any

547
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:29,840
reciprocity from them

548
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:32,000
they do not care about diversity of

549
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,919
opinions that kind of talking point

550
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,600
is just deployed to protect fascist

551
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:47,840
recruitment and intimidation

552
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:47,840
and to garner sympathy from centrists

553
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:54,939
[Music]

554
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:03,919
oh fascist strategies work

555
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,840
because centrists are usually naive

556
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:07,520
about them they don't notice dog

557
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,559
whistles and usually give fascists the

558
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,559
benefit of the doubt

559
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:12,480
following politics with centrists can be

560
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:14,160
like watching a raunchy comedy movie

561
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,039
with children who don't get sexual

562
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,720
innuendo

563
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:18,320
there's a whole hidden layer of meaning

564
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,240
that they're not picking up this makes

565
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:22,160
liberals centrists and conservatives who

566
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:24,960
are not savvy to fascist strategy

567
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:26,799
easy to exploit time and time again such

568
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:29,039
people end up inadvertently spreading

569
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:31,360
around fascist memes and talking points

570
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:32,880
without intending to or realizing it and

571
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:35,039
then they end up bewildered when

572
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,919
leftists who recognize the dog whistles

573
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:38,160
take offense

574
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:39,760
now you might wonder well if fascists

575
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,919
disguise themselves and liberals

576
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:44,240
inadvertently duplicate fascist memes

577
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:45,840
that isn't just about everyone's suspect

578
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:48,000
aren't you in fact just a paranoid

579
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:49,840
leftist who thinks everyone is a nazi

580
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,679
well that's what they want you to think

581
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:53,520
they benefit from the confusion and the

582
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:55,200
appearance that the left is paranoid

583
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:57,200
i'll admit there are cases where i can't

584
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,960
tell if someone is genuinely alt-light

585
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,640
or if they're just an oblivious centrist

586
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,400
who picked up the talking points

587
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,840
likewise it can be impossible to tell

588
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,919
the difference between someone who is

589
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,679
alt-light but not an outright fascist

590
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:09,520
and a fascist who is concealing their

591
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:11,919
power level so in a sense

592
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:14,240
yes i am a little bit paranoid the other

593
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:16,320
day the aclu tweeted a picture of an

594
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:19,120
adorable blonde child with the caption

595
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:20,320
this is the future aclu members want and

596
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,400
for a second i was like

597
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:24,000
what the [ __ ] because it has a close

598
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,760
resemblance to a 14 words

599
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,600
meme but of course it's unintentional

600
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:30,320
it's the aclu

601
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:31,760
i wanted to make sure unlike most

602
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:34,880
politicians

603
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:36,799
that what i said was correct not make a

604
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,640
quick statement the statement i made on

605
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:40,799
saturday the first statement

606
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:42,080
was a fine statement but you don't make

607
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:44,559
statements

608
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,440
that direct unless you know the fact yes

609
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:48,080
i have become

610
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:49,840
crazy but this paranoia self-doubt and

611
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:51,840
questioning of your own perception

612
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,880
is the psychological consequence of

613
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:55,360
being constantly

614
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:57,520
gaslit by fascists pretending not to be

615
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:59,440
fascists and communicating in code

616
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:01,679
and it's the intentional consequence of

617
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:04,240
that gaslighting is just another tool in

618
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:06,240
the fascist's psychological arsenal

619
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,840
so how do we get better at resisting

620
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,200
fascist strategies

621
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:11,280
i know if you're a centrist who has

622
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,720
inadvertently repeated fascist rhetoric

623
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,400
or defended fascists

624
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:16,080
it seems like the left all thinks you're

625
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,320
a nazi and that we hate you

626
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:19,360
and i admit that i am pretty frustrated

627
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:21,919
with you right now

628
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:23,840
obviously but my forgiveness and

629
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:25,440
encouragement are wide open to anyone

630
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,320
who wants to get better at resisting

631
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,400
fascism

632
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,440
fascist strategies can be very subtle

633
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,360
and very cunning

634
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:33,600
so don't feel guilty for falling for

635
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:35,760
them just try to get better at resisting

636
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:38,159
i guess my message to liberals centrists

637
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:40,080
and non-fascist conservatives is this

638
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:41,679
if you care about even one person of

639
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:44,080
color or queer person

640
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:46,080
or immigrant stand up for that person by

641
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:48,480
opposing the alt-right and its allies

642
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:50,159
do not give them a platform do not host

643
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,799
debates with them on your youtube

644
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:52,640
channel

645
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:54,480
yes they have a constitutional right to

646
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:56,080
free speech but they do not have a right

647
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,880
to a megaphone and you should not be

648
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,400
giving them one

649
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,080
i know to a lot of you this just seems

650
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,360
like the free marketplace of ideas

651
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,159
everyone expressing their ideas

652
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,320
peacefully

653
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:06,159
but to more vulnerable people some ideas

654
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:08,240
can be existentially dangerous

655
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:09,440
because if those ideas catch on their

656
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,880
lives are at stake

657
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:12,799
now if you're just an average person

658
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,799
without a big platform then you actually

659
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:16,320
can debate and you should be debating

660
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:18,159
argue with your friends who are getting

661
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:20,080
kind of alt-righty argue with your

662
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:21,919
family argue with your co-workers

663
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:23,600
let them know that you don't agree make

664
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:24,960
them listen to a different perspective

665
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,559
and if you're someone who's gotten

666
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,880
involved with the alt-right in the last

667
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:30,159
couple years and is now disillusioned to

668
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,440
find yourself in the midst of a

669
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:33,760
dangerous hate group

670
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:35,919
you have to get out now it's not too

671
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:37,760
late society will forgive you

672
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:39,039
if you don't know how to leave look up

673
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,799
life after hate

674
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:42,640
an organization founded by a former

675
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,600
neo-nazi that helps people get out of

676
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,640
hate groups

677
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:59,240
and as for all you lefties

678
00:21:46,640 --> 00:22:05,530
keep up the good fight comrades
