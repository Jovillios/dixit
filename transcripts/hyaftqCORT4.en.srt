about the West and Western culture and

26
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:35,240
Western civilization but what are those

27
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:36,799
words even mean I guess the mature and

28
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:39,350
responsible thing to do would be a

29
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:42,319
simple educational video to edify the

30
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:45,109

I mean morning and by morning I mean

36
00:01:55,159 --> 00:02:00,679

well angry white guy YouTube is usually

39
00:02:02,929 --> 00:02:06,110
talking about Western culture and it's

40
00:02:04,969 --> 00:02:08,869
been awhile since I've done a video

41
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:10,940
response so let's see what's going on in

42
00:02:08,869 --> 00:02:13,660
that part of the internet Magog is here

43
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:13,660
baby doll

44
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:27,130
that is a mad

45
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:30,250
Wow I've never done a video response to

46
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:33,040
such a powerful wizard the second and

47
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:35,110
third clues are else's magical powers

48
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,000
and the song let it go

49
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:41,530
both of these clues have to do with

50
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:44,650
coming up a magic power is the conflict

51
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:47,050
of the plot and her letting it go

52
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:47,860
it's just her realizing her true

53
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:50,560
potential

54
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:53,230
and her ability to conquer and rule her

55
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:56,319
kingdom she will destroy her enemies and

56
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:59,110
raise their castles to the ground some

57
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:00,970
let it goes basically [ __ ] this [ __ ] I'm

58
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:04,239
conquering everyone so just to be clear

59
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:06,190
this is this is a grown man who has

60
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:09,160
dressed himself in the garb of a

61
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:11,560
sorcerer to shout about a YouTube

62
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:13,150
channel for preschoolers it almost feels

63
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:15,100
like punching down at this point at

64
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:17,860
least the golden one was mask for mask

65
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:19,750
who can I punch out that well I don't

66
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:21,010
like talking about punching it makes me

67
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:22,840
feel like one of those people who talks

68
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:23,739
about punching turfs I would never a

69
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:27,100
bunch of turf

70
00:03:23,739 --> 00:03:27,840
my hands are too feminine and my fingers

71
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:31,209
are tired

72
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:33,489
someone massage them who can I claw up

73
00:03:31,209 --> 00:03:37,030
at the fundamental assumptions of

74
00:03:33,489 --> 00:03:37,810
Western civilization are valid how about

75
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:40,840
that

76
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:42,670
dad stop get out of my life in my video

77
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:44,650
about Jordan Peterson I talked about how

78
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:47,950
he posits a struggle between the West

79
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:51,010
and postmodern neo Marxism I argued that

80
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:53,200
homo Nomo is a label that includes a

81
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:54,850
bunch of incompatible ideas none of

82
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,100
which are in any sense non-western

83
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:59,380
unless of course you equate the West

84
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:01,720
with white people and Marxism with the

85
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:05,370
Jews which surely no one involved in

86
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:07,890
this conversation is doing a right

87
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:09,540
he wasn't a fan of the backseat in this

88
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:11,790
video I want to look a little bit closer

89
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:13,640
at the whole concept of the West and the

90
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:16,919
people who claim to defend it

91
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:18,329
Wow dad a nice sword

92
00:04:16,919 --> 00:04:20,609
god damn it we're gonna need to aim even

93
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:25,380
higher ladies gentlemen and beyond I

94
00:04:20,609 --> 00:04:26,820
give you the President of the United

95
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:29,850
States of America

96
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:32,430
big dick special big boy Donald Trump

97
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:34,770
just as Poland could not be broken I

98
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:39,199
declare today for the world to hear that

99
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:43,289
the West will never ever be broken our

100
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:49,070
values will prevail our people will

101
00:04:43,289 --> 00:04:49,070
thrive and our civilization will triumph

102
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:57,290
[Applause]

103
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:59,450
[Music]

104
00:04:57,290 --> 00:05:01,070
so we've got the most powerful [ __ ] boy

105
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:02,540
on the planet prattling on about the

106
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:04,880
battle for the survival of Western

107
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:06,260
civilization so I suppose we should

108
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,750
probably figure out what that's supposed

109
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:10,880
to mean which is too bad because that's

110
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:12,590
gonna require a lot of thinking and I

111
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,700
don't feel like thinking because my

112
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:17,950
brain is tired

113
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:20,720
someone massaged it and soon

114
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:22,700
mechanically dispirited after a dreary

115
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:25,460
day with the prospect of a depressing

116
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:28,040
morrow I raised to my lips a spoonful of

117
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:30,320
the tea and which I soaked a morsel of

118
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:32,210
the corndog no sooner had the warm

119
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:34,640
liquid mixed with the dog touched my

120
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:37,370
palate and a shudder ran through me and

121
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:39,020
I stopped intent upon the extraordinary

122
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:41,510
thing that was happening to me

123
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:44,900
an exquisite pleasure had invaded my

124
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:47,870
senses something isolated detached with

125
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:49,880
no suggestion of its origin and at once

126
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:53,030
the vicissitudes of life had become

127
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:56,270
indifferent to me as disasters innocuous

128
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:58,910
its brevity illusory this new sensation

129
00:05:56,270 --> 00:06:02,180
having had on me the effect which a love

130
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:04,790
has a post pre ambulatory banter whether

131
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:07,310
you're in fatty YouTube or poem oh no mo

132
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:08,840
akadama no it's comments take for

133
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:11,060
granted that there is a historically

134
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:13,310
continuous clearly defined thing called

135
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:15,740
Western civilization that starts in

136
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:21,260
ancient Athens and flourishes in our own

137
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:23,210
era of enlightened philosopher kings but

138
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:25,490
this is really just a story constructed

139
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:27,860
retrospectively by modern people for

140
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:30,320
particular purposes it's like an orange

141
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:32,420
in meth in an article titled there is no

142
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:35,210
such thing as Western civilization the

143
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:36,620
philosopher Kwame Anthony Appiah points

144
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:39,620
out that for the ancient Greek historian

145
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:41,960
Herodotus there was no such thing as the

146
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:44,210
West the world was divided into three

147
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:46,910
continents he called Europe Asia and

148
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:49,010
Libya Herodotus had no notion that these

149
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:51,230
three continents correspond to different

150
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:52,280
types of people and he never referred to

151
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:54,440
any group of people

152
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:56,600
the Europeans in fact he was much more

153
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:58,520
familiar with Egypt in Persia in which

154
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:00,560
he traveled than with the far away and

155
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:03,020
foreign people of northern Europe so the

156
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:05,300
idea of the West has to be more recent

157
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:07,460
than that really there is no one idea of

158
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:09,680
the West which is an umbrella term that

159
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:12,380
includes a lot of discontinuous cultures

160
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:14,240
and contradictory ideas according to me

161
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:15,800
there are six different concepts often

162
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,560
invoked under the heading of the West

163
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:20,750
let's talk about them now concept one

164
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:24,530
christened demand judeo-christian values

165
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:26,840
in the year 732 a soldier named Charles

166
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:28,820
Martel led Frankish forces to victory at

167
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:30,890
the Battle of Tor against the Islamic

168
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:33,200
forces that had advanced from Spain into

169
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:35,270
what is now France effectively halting

170
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:37,490
the spread of the Umayyad Caliphate into

171
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:39,320
Western Europe according to a paya the

172
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:43,490
first recorded use of the Latin term

173
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:45,590
Europe MCs for Europeans dates from 754

174
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:47,630
and describes the victors of the Battle

175
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:49,760
of Tora distinguishing Christians from

176
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:51,650
Muslims in the late Middle Ages the

177
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:53,270
concept of chrysanthemum appeared and

178
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:55,130
was used to distinguish the Christian

179
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:57,919
world from the Islamic world and from

180
00:07:55,130 --> 00:08:00,110
paganism this idea of Christendom is

181
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:02,360
arguably the earliest precursor to the

182
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:04,669
modern concept of the West notice that

183
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:06,979
the term itself posits and us versus

184
00:08:04,669 --> 00:08:09,440
them dichotomy where Christians or the

185
00:08:06,979 --> 00:08:11,390
US and Muslims or the sound the

186
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:13,700
Christian inheritance is still invoked

187
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:15,440
today by defenders of the West like lil

188
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:18,100
Benny and professor studied the blade

189
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:21,440
often under the heading of

190
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:23,570
judeo-christian a term usually used to

191
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,430
falsely imply that contemporary moral

192
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:27,680
norms derived from such a generic

193
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:29,870
parochial and incomplete document as the

194
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,940
Ten Commandments as if every major

195
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:34,310
civilization didn't have laws against

196
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:36,409
murder as if the prohibition of graven

197
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:38,150
images has any contemporary influence

198
00:08:36,409 --> 00:08:39,830
whatsoever as if it isn't an

199
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:41,990
embarrassment that there are four laws

200
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:44,300
protecting snowflake Yahweh's easily

201
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:46,250
triggered ego and non condemning slavery

202
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:48,890
and rape and what if I like it when my

203
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:50,810
neighbor covets Maya Bible jokes the

204
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:53,630
other main use of judeo-christian values

205
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:55,880
is as a bludgeon against single parents

206
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:58,250
and the queers speaking of which what

207
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:58,660
exactly are the family values we inherit

208
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:01,089
from

209
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:01,750
and um two kids and a dog just like the

210
00:09:01,089 --> 00:09:05,199
Bible says

211
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:07,000
well no polygon II is specifically

212
00:09:05,199 --> 00:09:08,920
acknowledged in the Old Testament and

213
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,750
not forbidden in either Testament even

214
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:12,940
in the beginning Eve couldn't keep her

215
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:15,100
hands away from strange serpents and who

216
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:17,259
can blame her and Joseph was a massive

217
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:19,480
[ __ ] who raised another man's child but

218
00:09:17,259 --> 00:09:21,399
it's cool he was into that in the Middle

219
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:23,560
Ages the Catholic Church gradually

220
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:24,279
enforced the one man and one woman view

221
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:26,230
of marriage

222
00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:28,870
although informally pagan lands this

223
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:31,269
idea was slow to take hold Charles

224
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:33,370
Martel's grandson Charlemagne had 18

225
00:09:31,269 --> 00:09:35,759
kids by at least 10 wives and concubines

226
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:39,670
because he was a proud son of the North

227
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:42,790
100% natty and Alpha's [ __ ] I'm sorry I

228
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:45,550
I just can't stop the golden one his

229
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:46,990
soul and mine are intermingled probably

230
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:50,050
because we both played twelve hundred

231
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:52,300
hours of Age of Empires in 1999 and then

232
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:54,730
something went terribly wrong [ __ ]

233
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:56,709
9/11 used to be such an innocent

234
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:58,920
decision choosing to play as the Franks

235
00:09:56,709 --> 00:10:01,420
or the Saracens then it became this huge

236
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:03,459
civilizational struggle and that's why

237
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:06,459
this guy is a fascist and I grew up to

238
00:10:03,459 --> 00:10:07,870
be a woman thanks a lot Osama being

239
00:10:06,459 --> 00:10:10,089
transgender is so weird

240
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:12,040
like you have these childhood memories

241
00:10:10,089 --> 00:10:13,959
that are just totally discordant with

242
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:15,850
your adult gender identity like how do

243
00:10:13,959 --> 00:10:17,920
you even deal with that well here's how

244
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:20,500
you bond with straight guys over your

245
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:24,750
shared age of empires nostalgia and then

246
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:24,750
you [ __ ] them I'm not like

247
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:29,460
[Music]

248
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:35,570
concept to enlightenment values so in

249
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:37,580
1517 an annoying social justice warrior

250
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:39,110
named Martin Luther nails his list of

251
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:41,030
whiney complaints to the door of the

252
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:43,280
church and Vidhan burg that kicks off a

253
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:45,020
century or so of brutal violence between

254
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:46,790
Catholics and Protestants that

255
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:48,620
eventually chills out but then the 18th

256
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:49,940
century rolls around and shit's just

257
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:51,790
[ __ ] crazy

258
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:54,080
there are various fops and Gandhi's

259
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:55,910
macaronis getting wired out of their

260
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:57,440
heads at coffee houses and babbling

261
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:59,960
about enlightenment like the beatnik

262
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,940
trash they are then 300 years later a

263
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:03,680
bunch of drink sought and Fedora tippers

264
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:06,050
appointed themselves intellectual

265
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:08,030
descendants of Voltaire before sinking

266
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:09,440
into sweeping sexual harassment

267
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:11,090
allegations under the rug

268
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,980
and making fifty five consecutive

269
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:14,900
YouTube videos about how Anita

270
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:16,880
sarkeesian is destroying video games

271
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:18,950
that's not what they were discussing at

272
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:21,410
the Parisian salon this is all very

273
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:24,130
embarrassing but still some of these

274
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:26,180
enlightenment values science Liberty

275
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:28,520
skepticism about dogma

276
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:30,410
these are basically good ideas and

277
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:32,390
they're part of the amalgamation we call

278
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:33,940
the West but it's important to keep in

279
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:36,140
mind that these ideas are not

280
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:37,760
judeo-christian in fact they're

281
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:39,440
specifically opposed to that way of

282
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:41,810
thinking so the some of what we now

283
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,970
think of as the West actually contains

284
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:46,250
major contradictions because the history

285
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:48,320
of the West is a history of change and

286
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:50,150
revolution so what a new movement comes

287
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,190
a long lake for instance a bunch of

288
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:54,350
buzzkill sad sacks pointing out that

289
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:56,360
actually our society is still pretty

290
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:58,580
terrible to women people of color and

291
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:00,170
gender and sexual minorities it might

292
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:01,790
not be the smartest thing to just

293
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:04,340
dismiss it as some kind of sinister

294
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:06,680
postmodern new Marxist cockle tree it

295
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:08,150
could be the next reformation in a

296
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:10,670
history March by a series of

297
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:13,040
informations if there are any historians

298
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:15,110
watching this please call it the SJW

299
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,810
reformation think about the Protestant

300
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:18,270
Reformation

301
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:20,250
at the time that probably seemed like a

302
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:22,830
civilizational threat at the Holy Roman

303
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:25,140
Empire and they kinda was but in

304
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:27,150
retrospect we see the Reformation as

305
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:29,279
just as important a moment in Western

306
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:30,150
culture as the medieval period that

307
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:32,250
preceded it

308
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:34,770
but today's counter-reformation made up

309
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:37,560
of people like orangie smalls and dr.

310
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:39,240
clean your room insist on pretending the

311
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:41,400
current reformation is some kind of

312
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:42,690
alien threat and as for the counter

313
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:45,120
counter Reformation

314
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:48,270
well that's what you pay a trashy Tran

315
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:50,610
to do concept three Western culture the

316
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:52,350
idea of the West has its roots in the

317
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:54,060
medieval schism between the Western

318
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:56,490
Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern

319
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:59,460
Orthodox Church but in its contemporary

320
00:12:56,490 --> 00:13:01,710
sense the idea of Western culture didn't

321
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:03,360
really exist until the imperialist era

322
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:05,610
of the late 19th and early 20th

323
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:08,880
centuries when it was popularized in

324
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:10,920
part by Oswald Spengler is 1918 book the

325
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:13,560
decline of the West an important

326
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:15,000
influence on Nazi ideology as long as

327
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:17,190
people have been talking about Western

328
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,950
culture they've been worried about its

329
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:21,870
alleged decline in degeneration as I've

330
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:24,330
discussed in several earlier videos

331
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:26,160
which I encourage you not to watch but

332
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:28,230
the idea of Western culture was

333
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:30,270
influential well beyond the third right

334
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:33,060
at the height of European imperialism

335
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:35,160
the idea of a superior high culture of

336
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:37,050
the West was a convenient excuse to

337
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:39,330
plunder and exploit the mysterious

338
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:41,040
Orient and even though we've swept the

339
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:41,910
matter overtly supremacist rhetoric

340
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,130
under the rug

341
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:46,050
the idea of Western culture is still a

342
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:47,760
foundational concept in our schools and

343
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:49,230
universities where you have to take

344
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:51,930
courses like history of Western

345
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:53,280
civilization or Western literature but

346
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:55,320
you didn't actually do any of the

347
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:57,150
readings for because you're too busy

348
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:59,280
crouching in the bushes outside the

349
00:13:57,150 --> 00:14:01,200
dean's office vomiting up a couple pints

350
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:03,690
of Malibu the consequence of this

351
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:05,850
Western culture education is that we now

352
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:08,160
all have this sense that we belong to a

353
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:10,110
continuous civilization whose crowning

354
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:12,900
achievements are the ten commandments

355
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:16,260
jesus-fuckin'-christ athenian pederasts

356
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:18,959
cathedrals Mozart human rights science

357
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:21,060
and iPhones but the reality is this is

358
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:22,990
an essentialist conglomeration of a

359
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:25,120
history that's much more nonlinear

360
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:26,649
we often think we in the West claim to

361
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,990
be the inheritors of the ancient

362
00:14:26,649 --> 00:14:30,910
traditions of Aristotle and Abraham but

363
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:33,430
the Islamic world is entitled to just

364
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:35,830
the same claim st. Thomas Aquinas one of

365
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:37,630
the most powerful Catholic sorcerers is

366
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:39,910
largely responsible for introducing

367
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:41,020
Aristotle to Christian universities but

368
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:42,520
he never would have encountered

369
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:44,529
Aristotle in the first place

370
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:47,020
had not ancient Greek philosophy been

371
00:14:44,529 --> 00:14:49,450
translated and commentated by Islamic

372
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:51,399
scholars like even rushed so the origins

373
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:53,050
of Western culture aren't really unique

374
00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:54,690
to us at all and the stuff that is

375
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:57,550
unique is just a mess of contradictions

376
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:59,440
on the one hand you have judeo-christian

377
00:14:57,550 --> 00:15:01,779
values and on the other hand you have

378
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,700
degenerates like William Shakespeare who

379
00:15:01,779 --> 00:15:05,080
wrote plays for men to dress up as fairy

380
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:08,230
Queens and make out with each other

381
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:10,029
which for the record is disgusting and I

382
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:11,110
condemn it and I'll have no part in it

383
00:15:10,029 --> 00:15:13,180
cuz if you didn't know

384
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:15,730
and Shakespeare times boys and drag

385
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:17,709
played female parts I wish I had female

386
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:21,190
parts working on it

387
00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:24,130
concept for the free world from 1941 to

388
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:26,170
1945 Franklin Roosevelt's vice-president

389
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:28,240
was Henry Wallace an agricultural

390
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:30,100
scientist from Iowa whom Democratic

391
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,470
Party officials despised for being what

392
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:34,089
we'd now call a Democratic Socialist

393
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:36,670
while this later ran for president in

394
00:15:34,089 --> 00:15:38,500
1948 as a third party candidate on a

395
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:40,810
platform of universal health care

396
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:43,060
anti segregation in opposition to the

397
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:44,470
Cold War during the campaign Wallace was

398
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:46,899
widely mocked in the press for his

399
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:49,149
spiritualism his refusal to disavow the

400
00:15:46,899 --> 00:15:50,290
communist party's endorsement and what

401
00:15:49,149 --> 00:15:52,959
Time magazine called

402
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:55,750
his assault on the south that is his

403
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:57,910
quote ostentatious ride through cities

404
00:15:55,750 --> 00:16:00,100
and towns with his negro secretary

405
00:15:57,910 --> 00:16:02,980
beside him for which he was pelted with

406
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:05,110
tomatoes and eggs the poor naive Wallace

407
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:07,029
commented there is something so well

408
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:09,370
lovely about hate when you see it

409
00:16:07,029 --> 00:16:09,940
distorting the human phase well get used

410
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:12,310
to it buddy

411
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:15,220
this is America am i lecturing someone

412
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:17,770
from 1940 about how bigoted this country

413
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:20,290
is this is fine Wallace received only

414
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:22,750
2.4 percent of the popular vote in the

415
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:25,060
1948 election and he's now best

416
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:27,550
remembered for his 1942 speech titled

417
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:29,380
the century of the common man in which

418
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:30,540
he contrasts in what he called the slave

419
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:33,210
world of fashion

420
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:35,460
with the free world what he described as

421
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:38,910
an incomplete and ongoing international

422
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:41,130
People's Revolution no Nazi comfort

423
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:43,530
revolution will stop

424
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:45,780
the common man will swap the Hitler

425
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:50,130
Stooges out into the open in the United

426
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:53,040
States in Latin America and in India he

427
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:56,730
will destroy their influence no levels

428
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:59,160
no Mussolini's will be tolerated in a

429
00:16:56,730 --> 00:17:01,140
free world Wallace had an especially

430
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:03,570
left-wing take on it but it was common

431
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:05,580
during World War two when the phrase the

432
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:08,190
free world first entered common parlance

433
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:10,860
to include all the countries opposing

434
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:13,650
the Axis powers including the dirty Reds

435
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:16,470
after the war the phrase the free world

436
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:18,630
remained common in American politics but

437
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:20,400
the meaning shifted instead of referring

438
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:23,010
to the international alliance against

439
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:25,650
fascism they referred to the capitalist

440
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:28,800
West as opposed to the communist East

441
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:30,690
the idea of the free capitalist West is

442
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:32,670
still an important ingredient in this

443
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:33,690
jumbled concept we call Western

444
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:35,730
civilization

445
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:38,370
so when lobster dad says is a struggle

446
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:40,890
between Marxism and the West it seems at

447
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:41,610
first like he's just stuck in the 1980s

448
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:43,410
or something

449
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:45,930
doesn't he know there's no more Eastern

450
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:47,880
Bloc dad what year do you think it is

451
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:50,400
are you at war in your head with the

452
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:52,800
goddamn brewskies they're on your side

453
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:55,200
now remember the truth is he's just

454
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:57,930
using the term neo Marxism to invoke Red

455
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:59,880
Scare sentiment in opposition to the SJW

456
00:17:57,930 --> 00:18:02,070
Reformation but the point I'm trying to

457
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:04,140
make is that the West is a concept or

458
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:06,420
rather several contradictory concepts

459
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:09,090
that are always posited in particular

460
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:11,250
political circumstances as one side of

461
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:12,810
an us-versus-them opposition whether

462
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:15,120
it's the Christian West versus the

463
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:17,610
infidels the Enlightenment West versus

464
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:20,310
Islam the cultured West versus the

465
00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:22,590
colonized savages the capitalist West

466
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:24,810
versus the communist East where the

467
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:27,180
white European West versus the Jewish

468
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:29,160
cultural Marxist plot to [ __ ] the sons

469
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:30,570
of the north by besmirching the purity

470
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:32,220
of their fair maidens in

471
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:34,470
in their countries with a barbarous

472
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:37,289
Board of third-world migrants I guess I

473
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:40,350
have to say something about that concept

474
00:18:37,289 --> 00:18:42,659
five blood and soil if you ask leading

475
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:45,120
Nazi social-media influencer Richard

476
00:18:42,659 --> 00:18:47,340
Spencer what he thinks the West is he'll

477
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:49,830
tell you that it's a cultural Geographic

478
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:51,690
and genetic inheritance bequeathed to

479
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:54,570
European people by their fair-skinned

480
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:56,940
ancestors to Spencer the idea that a

481
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:58,649
person of Asian or African descent could

482
00:18:56,940 --> 00:19:01,740
be part of the West is ridiculous

483
00:18:58,649 --> 00:19:04,230
because for Spencer to be Western is to

484
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:06,269
be white now the thing about that is as

485
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:08,570
an analysis of the common usage of the

486
00:19:06,269 --> 00:19:11,009
term the West it's not even wrong

487
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:12,960
consider Latin America where the main

488
00:19:11,009 --> 00:19:14,850
languages spoken are Spanish Portuguese

489
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,950
and French where the majority of

490
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:19,080
religion is room and Catholicism why is

491
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:21,059
this region generally not regarded as

492
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:23,399
part of the west by our immigrants from

493
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:25,559
this region demonized as alien intruders

494
00:19:23,399 --> 00:19:27,929
well because it's people have too much

495
00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:30,090
melanin to join the club or to be more

496
00:19:27,929 --> 00:19:32,220
accurate the flexible and historically

497
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:34,830
variant concepts of whiteness and the

498
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:36,809
West have been constructed so as to

499
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:38,789
exclude them and I've already spent half

500
00:19:36,809 --> 00:19:40,860
my youtube career on delirious gay

501
00:19:38,789 --> 00:19:42,480
screeching about Nazis so I don't want

502
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:44,700
to do more of that now but suffice to

503
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,710
say the association between whiteness

504
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:49,200
and the West is always lurking beneath

505
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:51,360
the surface and when whiteness rears its

506
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:54,059
head proudly the result is the ugliest

507
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:56,250
crimes our civilization is capable of as

508
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:58,320
I'm making this video the machinery of

509
00:19:56,250 --> 00:20:00,240
the middle stages of those crimes is up

510
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:02,639
and running yet again thanks to a

511
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:04,950
refugee crisis in Europe and a racist

512
00:20:02,639 --> 00:20:06,899
demagogue in the United States and once

513
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:09,750
more both continents are dotted with

514
00:20:06,899 --> 00:20:13,519
barbed wire refugee cádiz and internment

515
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:17,850
camps full of children torn from parents

516
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:20,460
concept six the evil West the West in

517
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:22,169
many ways is an inherently supremacist

518
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:24,960
concept it's thought to be more

519
00:20:22,169 --> 00:20:26,850
civilized more holy and more cultured

520
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:29,009
than the non West but there are some

521
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:31,200
ridiculous college professors who adopt

522
00:20:29,009 --> 00:20:33,330
this story wholesale but flip it on its

523
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,610
head according to them the West is not

524
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:39,360
uniquely civilized but uniquely

525
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:41,850
uncivilized cruel imperialistic racist

526
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:44,220
and genocidal but this just perpetuates

527
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:46,440
the same essentializing error Europe

528
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:48,090
aren't inherently more evil anymore than

529
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:50,340
they're inherently more civilized

530
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:53,039
if capitalist imperialism had burst out

531
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:54,960
of Africa 400 years ago the result would

532
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:57,210
have been just as brutal so instead of

533
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:59,580
vilifying the West I think we should get

534
00:20:57,210 --> 00:21:01,470
rid of the concept altogether adopt a

535
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:03,510
more cosmopolitan understanding of

536
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:05,880
ourselves and acknowledge that the world

537
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:08,250
is too complicated to reduce to simple

538
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:10,230
us and them binaries which is not to say

539
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:12,000
that we have to get rid of Aristotle in

540
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:14,250
classical music and the Cheesecake

541
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,320
Factory we can still keep all that [ __ ]

542
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:22,740
while eliminating the propaganda and

543
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:25,289
injustice that surrounds it coda my mind

544
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:28,409
is a predator that preys upon itself

545
00:21:25,289 --> 00:21:29,340
what if traps are gay what if no one can

546
00:21:28,409 --> 00:21:31,710
ever love you

547
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:33,390
what if happiness is impossible what if

548
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:35,370
everyone who complements me is lying

549
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:37,230
they can laugh at me leader when I

550
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:39,000
delusionally feel good if whatever if

551
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:41,039
when you die you stay conscious and then

552
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,510
you just saw what if I'm standing in an

553
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:45,030
awkward way and it looks weird

554
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:46,980
what if Blanche shard is right what are

555
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:48,600
these horrible goddamn noises coming out

556
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:50,820
of my mouth sometimes you just need a

557
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:52,380
break from your own brain and music is

558
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:54,780
really great for that I've always liked

559
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:57,270
classical music when I listen to Mozart

560
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:59,490
or Mendelssohn or even an amateur like

561
00:21:57,270 --> 00:22:01,530
sati my mind has lifted to a higher

562
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:02,990
plateau and I don't care what

563
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:05,059
civilization

564
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:07,340
came from or whether he was a bigot or a

565
00:22:05,059 --> 00:22:10,460
sexist and I don't want to know because

566
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:14,659
I need this I need this feeling that

567
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:17,110
makes me just want to take a big inside

568
00:22:14,659 --> 00:22:17,110
of my balls

569
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:23,840
are not gonna fit to it once

570
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:34,050
so okay fine he is the head of an ass

571
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:37,160
but there's certain advantages to that

572
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:37,160
that's all I'm saying

573
00:22:39,230 --> 00:23:26,280
[Music]

574
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:32,420
whoa
