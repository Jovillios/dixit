downfall. So, I'm somewhat interested in

16
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:58,640
conspiracy theories. I don't believe in

17
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:01,760
them, but it's one of those things, you

18
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,600
know, like cults or serial killers. I

19
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:07,200
don't want to join a cult. I don't want

20
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:10,200
to kill anybody, but when it happens, I

21
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,400
take an interest. Ooh, what's going on

22
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,720
here? It's good to start a video by

23
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,960
saying something nice. So, let's all go

24
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:19,520
around and say our favorite thing about

25
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:21,119
conspiracy theorists. I'll go first. My

26
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:24,960
favorite thing about conspiracy

27
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:27,040
theorists is their passion for diagrams.

28
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:31,160
As long as the internet has existed,

29
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:35,240
researchers have posted conspiracy

30
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:38,640
[Music]

31
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:41,439
diagrams. This is one from 1999 with

32
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,759
Lucifer at the top. Before the internet,

33
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:45,720
people had to draw these things by hand.

34
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:47,840
The pyramid shape is considered

35
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:50,640
traditional. I remember seeing this one

36
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:54,720
around 2010. At the bottom are the debt

37
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:57,600
slaves, the sheeple. You are here above

38
00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:00,479
us. World population control, religion,

39
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:03,840
government, education, media, and then

40
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:06,640
like corporations, man. Then the banks,

41
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,959
the think tanks, the elite families, the

42
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:11,480
crown, and at the very top, the

43
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:14,560
allseeing eye. Maybe it's the

44
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:16,959
Illuminati. Maybe it's the reptiles.

45
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,720
Maybe it's daddy when he's arrived and

46
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:20,319
he's taking his belt off. You know, it's

47
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,720
like daddy arrived and he's taking his

48
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:24,959
belt off. Let's face it, most conspiracy

49
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:28,000
diagrams look like the untethered

50
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:29,840
scribblings of incurable screw balls.

51
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,400
And maybe they are, but I think they're

52
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:35,519
also a sincere attempt to understand the

53
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:38,319
shape of power. Not a good attempt, but

54
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:40,879
that's okay. I no longer expect good

55
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:43,280
things. Every conspiracy diagram is an

56
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:45,120
answer to the question, who really

57
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,040
controls the world? The pyramid

58
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,959
represents hierarchy. It's like those

59
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,760
medieval drawings of the great chain of

60
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:54,400
being. Medieval Europeans saw reality

61
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:57,200
itself as a kind of pyramid with God at

62
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,560
the top, the supreme being. Each tier

63
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,360
beneath him represents a lower

64
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,920
emanation. The orders of angels, humans,

65
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:06,159
animals, plants, and minerals. Medieval

66
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:09,840
cosmology was a mirror of medieval

67
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:12,080
politics. As below, so above. The feudal

68
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:15,200
system was a pyramid with the monarch at

69
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:19,120
the top, then nobles, knights, vassels,

70
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:21,519
merchants, peasants, and surfs. In 2023,

71
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,840
passionate graphic designer Dylan Lewis

72
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:26,560
Monroe created a conspiracy diagram

73
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,159
called the world hierarchy pyramid. It

74
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:31,040
combines the medieval great chain of

75
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:33,120
being with every conspiracy theory. At

76
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:35,519
the top is the tetrogrammaton. That's

77
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:38,400
the Hebrew name of God. Then the angels,

78
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:41,159
the extraterrestrials, dark AI,

79
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:44,680
transdimensional ETS, the Borg,

80
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:47,760

85
00:03:53,200 --> 00:04:01,920
bottom, the matrix. 9 to5 dead slaves,

86
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:04,080
peasants, sheep, cattle, NPCs, maskers,

87
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:06,439
monster energy drinks. Oh, they think

88
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:09,920
it's satanic. So, you go into

90
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:16,239
six. You could have here in Hebrew 666

91
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,160
on the can. Now, do you know what a mil

92
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:20,359
is?

goyam? Okay, it is way too early in the

101
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:43,520

102
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:46,479
not dealing with Goyam for at least an

103
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:48,320
hour. So, put a pin in it. And for now,

104
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:49,919
I'll pretend I didn't see that. The

105
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,280
world hierarchy pyramid looks like

106
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:54,919
something you'd find in the basement of

00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,919

how can someone be this wrong about

every aspect of reality? Is anything

112
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:10,960
about this right? Well, isn't it true

113
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:14,160
that power is a pyramid? You could make

114
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:16,080
a less crazy pyramid diagram. a 1911

115
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,320
illustration called the pyramid of the

116
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,479
capitalist system. Oh god, we're already

117
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:22,639
talking about capitalism never beating

118
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:24,560
the bread tube allegations. The pyramid

119
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:26,800
of the capitalist system has the workers

120
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:29,440
at the bottom, then the bourgeoisi, the

121
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,840
army, clergy, politicians, and at the

122
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:35,280
very top in place of the king in place

123
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:36,400
of God is money itself. A conspiracy

124
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,560
theorist would look at this and say,

125
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:41,199
"Well, that can't be right. Money can't

126
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:44,160
be at the top because money does not

127
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:46,639
conspire. Money has no plans, no

128
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:52,039
intentions of its own. It isn't good or

00:05:55,960 --> 00:06:01,320
world? What's up, you guys? Just checked

132
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:04,600
into the Watergate

133
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:06,680

134
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:10,240
cute. Nice

136
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,039

137
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:19,880

[Music]

139
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:25,720
questions. So, I spent the last year of

140
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:29,520
my life researching conspiracy theories

141
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:31,840
online and I'm not doing well. Every

142
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,360
time you saw Taylor Swift on your TV at

143
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,600
the Super Bowl, you were flashed with

144
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:38,160
demonic hand gestures and an inverted

145
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,600
cross. Did he just say Taylor swifed? I

146
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,759
can't even tell reality from parody

147
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:44,560
anymore. It's like that essay, A modest

148
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:46,639
proposal by Jonathan Swift. I feel like

149
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,800
I'm losing my mind. So, to ground

150
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:51,280
myself, I tried asking some normal,

151
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:53,280
non-terminally online people what they

152
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,440
think about conspiracy theories. And

153
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:57,280
what I found is that for most people,

154
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:00,240
conspiracy theories are a mainly

155
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:03,120
harmless game they play. The game of

156
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:06,080
what if. You know, what if Tupac and

157
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:08,960
Elvis are still alive? And what if they

158
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:12,280
hang out in the UFO at Area 51 with

159
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:15,280
Sasquatch and Taylor Swift's gay whiff?

160
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:18,080
Sure, why not? Speculating about who

161
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:20,240
really killed JFK is basically America's

162
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:22,960
pastime? Because it's more exciting than

163
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:25,680
baseball and it's like a murder mystery.

164
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:29,639
We all get to play detective. Was it the

165
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:32,720
Russians, the CIA, pro-Castro Cubans,

166
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:34,960
anti-Castro Cubans, Colonel Mustard on

167
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:37,280
the grassy null with the magic bullet?

168
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:39,199
America has a weird obsession with JFK.

169
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:42,960
I feel like it's because of two things.

170
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:45,360
One, he's hot. Two, he's dead. And it's

171
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:47,759
that combination of hot and dead that

172
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:50,160
really gets our juices flowing. Whenever

173
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:52,960
I imagine JFK, I see him silhouetted

174
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:56,080
against soft white light, and he smiles

175
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:59,680
at me lovingly in slow motion. JFK is

176
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,680
America's beautiful dead wife in a

177
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:07,039
flashback. He's our dead anime mom.

178
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:09,440
Okasan, I can't believe we fumbled her.

179
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:11,599
So, look, I hate to be a buzzkill. I

180
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:13,520
know it's fun to speculate wildly about

181
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:16,240
the secret conspiracies behind world

182
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:18,879
events, but for me, it stopped being fun

183
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:21,680
a long time ago. I can't pinpoint when

184
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:24,639
exactly, but there's a couple moments

185
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:27,919
that stand out. Exhibit A is Edgar

186
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:29,919
Madison Welch, who on December 4, 2016

187
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:32,479
drove from North Carolina to Washington

188
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:35,200
DC and entered neighborhood pizzeria

189
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:37,120
comet pingpong with an AR-15 rifle,

190
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,599
which he fired through a closet door,

191
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,880
terrifying customers and staff. He later

192
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:43,839
told police he was quote

193
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:46,320
self-investigating. He was doing his own

194
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:48,480
research. He was self-investigating the

195
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,959
Pizzagate conspiracy theory, which

196
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:53,920
falsely claimed that leaked emails from

197
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:56,080
my close personal friend Hillary Clinton

198
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:58,320
contained cryptic references to an elite

199
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:00,720
underground satanic ritual murder and

200
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:03,600
child sex trafficking operation. It's a

201
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:05,600
shame because baseless speculation about

202
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:08,160
the lurid sexual depravity of the rich

203
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:11,200
and famous can be a lot of fun, but when

204
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:13,360
someone picks up a gun, the truth is not

205
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,440
a game. The shooter would later tell the

206
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,080
New York Times, quote, "The intel on

207
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:20,880
this wasn't

208
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:22,640
100%." Yeah. Exhibit B is America's

209
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:25,440
foremost conspiracy theorist for the

210
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:27,760
last quarter century, Alex Jones, live

211
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:30,000
on Infowars, mogging the father of a

212
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:32,080
child who was killed at Sandy Hook. And

213
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,200
I know Alex Jones has paid a heavy price

214
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:37,680
for this, but it is pretty heinous. I I

215
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,839
mean, it's like, yeah. Oh, read this

216
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:42,320
card.

217
00:09:38,839 --> 00:09:45,200
Okay. I mean, it's like, whoa.

218
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:47,519
Wa. I don't know. Is this what

219
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:49,600
questioning authority looks like? It's

220
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:53,279
not just asking questions if the way

221
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:54,560
you're going about it is uh fish. Of

222
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:56,240
course, when you point out the harm done

223
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,600
by conspiracy theorists, they say,

224
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:00,320
"Well, that's just controlled

225
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:03,360
opposition. It's a scop designed to make

226
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:06,480
us look bad." And okay, I guess it's

227
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:08,399
possible that it's a scop. But isn't it

228
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,480
also possible that you've simply

229
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,320
surrounded yourself with [ __ ]

230
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,480
Conspiracy theorists tend not to take

231
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,720
criticism well. They feel like you're

232
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,720
manipulating them, like you're shaming

233
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:21,279
and vilifying people just for

234
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:23,839
questioning official narratives. And

235
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:26,240
isn't that exactly what they'd expect a

236
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:28,640
shill for the deep state to do? Isn't

237
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,640
conspiracy theorists just a slur for

238
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:33,120
anyone who dares to snap out of their

239
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:36,160
programming? A convenient way to silence

240
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:38,079
anyone who questions the establishment?

241
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:40,640
Well, it's good to be skeptical and it's

242
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:42,079
good to ask questions, but there's a

243
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:45,040
difference between intelligent

244
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:47,600
skepticism and, for example, denying

245
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:50,079
well-documented events on the basis of

246
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:52,560
wild conjecture posted online by some

247
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:54,079
maniac moments before harpooning his own

248
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,519
parents. Just because you're asking

249
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:57,399
questions doesn't mean the questions

250
00:10:55,519 --> 00:11:00,920
you're asking are

251
00:10:57,399 --> 00:11:04,000
good. Who really controls the

252
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:05,760
moon? No one controls the moon, Vanessa.

253
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,760
That's not a good question. Go back to

254
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,839
your desk. Conspiracy theorists think of

255
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:12,880
themselves as speaking truth to power

256
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:15,120
and challenging the establishment. But

257
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:17,519
is that even what they're doing? See, I

258
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:20,000
can also ask questions. My first

259
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:22,000
question is, which establishment are you

260
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,640
questioning? Does this establishment

261
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,399
include Donald Trump and Elon Musk? I

262
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,320
noticed Alex Jones and many other

263
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:30,320
conspiracy theorists have taken to

264
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,880
shilling for both of them now that they

265
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:35,120
are collaborating so closely,

266
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:37,040
conspiring, if you will. One thing we've

267
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:39,600
seen in the United States over the last

268
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:42,160
decade is that when an entire political

269
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,519
party embraces conspiracy theories, you

270
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:46,240
can't really say that conspiracy

271
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:48,880
theorists are questioning propaganda

272
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:51,839
because the conspiracy theories are the

273
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:53,600
propaganda. On December 2nd, 2015,

274
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:55,600
presidential contender Donald Trump

275
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:58,320
appeared as a guest on Infowars with

276
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:01,360
Alex Jones. Let's look at the comments.

277
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:04,279
This video is shadowbanned. The elite

278
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:07,839
don't want the people to see this.

279
00:12:04,279 --> 00:12:10,240
1984 is here. Okay. But the interview is

280
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:13,360
on YouTube and it was the first result

281
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:15,680
when I Googled it and Donald Trump is

282
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:19,440
the president of the most powerful

283
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:22,160
country in the world. So, who exactly

284
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:24,720
are the elite? Isn't what people call

285
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:27,279
the elite or the establishment really

286
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:29,279
just a bunch of waring factions? And

287
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:31,680
isn't one of those factions the United

288
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:34,240
States Republican Party, now essentially

289
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:36,000
a right-wing conspiracist party, their

290
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,240
three-time presidential nominee and

291
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,360
two-term president, two-term president

292
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:43,839
so far, entered politics in 2011 as a

293
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:48,120
birther conspiracy theorist. But he was

294
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:48,120
just asking questions, right?

295
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:52,470
[Applause]

296
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:57,279
step

297
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:59,839
back. MPD, stand back up to the deck. On

298
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:02,320
January 6th, 2021, the capital was

299
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:04,639
stormed by 10,000 self-described

300
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,880
patriots, aiming to violently overturn

301
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:09,040
the results of the 2020 election because

302
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:10,959
of conspiracy theories spread by Trump

303
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:14,160
and that scummy lawyer he used to hang

304
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:16,000
out with. Let's have trial by combat. We

305
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:20,639
will never give up. We will never

306
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:22,720
concede. We will stop the steel.

307
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:25,200
A month earlier, Trump's former national

308
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:27,680
security adviser, Michael Flynn, invoked

309
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,519
the stop the steel conspiracy theory in

310
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:32,000
a call for Trump to suspend the

311
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:34,000
Constitution and declare martial law.

312
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,320
Exactly the things conspiracy theorists

313
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,839
have been worried about for decades. But

314
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:40,079
when it actually happened in front of

315
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:42,320
their eyes, they didn't notice because

316
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:44,560
the conspiracy theory was the

317
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:47,600
propaganda. And in the background of all

318
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:49,440
this, of course, was KQAnon. I assume

319
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:52,000
you all know what KQanon is, but

320
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:54,320
sometimes it's good to verbalize it just

321
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:57,040
to remind yourself how much the vibes

322
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:59,839
have deteriorated. Q Anon was an online

323
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:02,079
messianic conspiracy cult whose core

324
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:05,120
belief was that the world is ruled by a

325
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:08,000
global elite of satanic sex trafficking

326
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:10,800
cannibals from whom the children would

327
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,040
be saved by reality TV star turned

328
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:15,839
President Donald Trump whose sacred

329
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:18,320
mission was to declare martial law, end

330
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:21,199
the adrenochrome harvest, and purge the

331
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:24,000
deep state ped cabal in a wave of mass

332
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:25,440
executions called the storm. This he

333
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,760
would accomplish with the help of

334
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:30,399
military intelligence insiders known as

335
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:33,120
Q, who only communicated with the public

336
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:35,839
via cryptic messages on a CD racist

337
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,519
image board called Aidcoon, operated by

338
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:41,680
a father-son team of American

339
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:41,680
pornographers out of a hog farm in the

340
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:48,480
Philippines. The online conspiracy world

341
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:50,079
has since moved on from QAnon. In fact,

342
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,839
they'll tell you that it was actually

343
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:55,279
controlled opposition and a

344
00:14:52,839 --> 00:14:57,120
distraction. Denial is always the last

345
00:14:55,279 --> 00:15:00,320
stage of these things. The so-called

346
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:02,959
QAnon shaman, Jacob Chanley, now claims

347
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:05,440
he was unfairly associated with QAnon by

348
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:08,000
the media in quote, an attempt to

349
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:10,320
control the narrative and destroy my

350
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,639
public image. It's not what he said four

351
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,240
years ago. Q most certainly did send me,

352
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:16,160
ladies and gentlemen. Q is the highest

353
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,920
levels of the military and the

354
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:20,079
intelligence community in the United

355
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:22,560
States and they are disseminating above

356
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:24,959
top secret information to patriots in

357
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:26,639
our republic. That means people like you

358
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:29,040
so that we can take back our country

359
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:31,519
from the communists and the globalists.

360
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:34,480
He now blames the whole thing on Antifa,

361
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:36,560
Black Lives Matter, and the deep state.

362
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:38,880
And I think it's more like uh the deep

363
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:41,120
state setup riots than Trump riots. I

364
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:42,639
don't think Trump had people do that. I

365
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,880
think it was more likely that the feds

366
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:46,560
and the crowd and anti and BLM were

367
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:48,720
largely responsible. It's like the

368
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:50,800
narcissist's prayer. You know, that

369
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:53,279
didn't happen. And if it did, it wasn't

370
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:56,000
that bad. And if it was, it was Nancy

371
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:58,320
Pelosy's fault. And if it wasn't, the

372
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,880
deep state made me do it. It was

373
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:03,839
controlled opposition that I was a part

374
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:05,759
of somehow. So, no, I'm not just going

375
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:07,759
to pretend QAnon didn't happen because

376
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:09,519
it would be convenient for you. If you

377
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:11,680
just memoryhole these things, then you

378
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:13,839
never learn anything and we just do it

379
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:17,959
all again. American politics is post

380
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:19,759
QAnon in the sense of like post 911 or

381
00:16:17,959 --> 00:16:21,680
postapocalypse. It's not like things are

382
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:23,839
going back to the way they were and more

383
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:26,160
like this is just the way things are

384
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:28,720
now. QAnon's core idea was that the

385
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:31,279
world is ruled by a satanic pedophile

386
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:34,000
elite who must be purged by a right-wing

387
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:36,079
authoritarian takeover. And this idea is

388
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,240
as popular as ever. Here's right-wing

389
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:39,920
misogyny influencer and alleged sex

390
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,759
trafficker Andrew Tate, I don't even

391
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:44,800
want to be alive anymore, getting

392
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:47,120
131,000 likes on Elon's X.com for

393
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:49,360
announcing that drag queens at the 2024

394
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:52,880
Paris Olympic opening ceremony proved

395
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:56,079
that a satanic cabal controls the West.

396
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:57,839
Here's ambient enthusiast Roseanne Bar

397
00:16:56,079 --> 00:17:00,720
on stage with Tucker Carlson in

398
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:02,720
September 2024, shrieking about cannibal

399
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:05,520
vampires and riing up the crowd for

400
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:09,439
another insurrection. You know, they eat

401
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:11,280
babies. That is not [ __ ] It's true.

402
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:14,000
So, it's not just the dogs and the cats,

403
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:17,439
not just the pets. They're full on

404
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:20,559
vampires. They love the taste of human

405
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:23,120
flesh and they drink human blood. Fouchi

406
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:27,280
gave everybody AIDS, too. Did you know

407
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:29,760
that? He did. Google it. These are not

408
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:31,440
fringe ideas anymore. Alex Jones has

409
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:33,760
faded from relevance, less because of

410
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:36,160
his deplatforming and more because of

411
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:38,160
the mainstreaming of his own ideas. He

412
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:40,400
used to be king of the fringe, but now

413
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:43,360
he's not so far from the center. A

414
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:45,120
little fish in a big conspiracist pond.

415
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:46,640
It would be an exaggeration to say that

416
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,960
conspiracy theories have become the

417
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:51,039
dominant form of political discourse,

418
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:53,600
but not that much of an exaggeration.

419
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:56,160
During the 2024 election season, four of

420
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:58,320
the top six podcasters on Spotify were

421
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:00,640
conspiracy theorists. President Trump's

422
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:02,559
campaign was backed by Elon Musk, who

423
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:04,400
tweeted about Pizzagate on the eve of

424
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:07,440
the election, the result of which

425
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:08,880
increased his net worth by $200 billion.

426
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,720
And Musk, of course, has now been

427
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:13,640
appointed to the newly created

428
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:18,480
Department of Government Efficiency or

429
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:22,160
Doge. Wealth, my lord, you win. T

430
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:26,160
interwebs today, good sir. Wait a

431
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:29,919
liberals epic style. Shadlay my brothers

432
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:32,320
top cat legalize comedy. I'm this close

433
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:33,919
to losing it. Don't [ __ ] with me fellas.

434
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:36,240
Another conspiracist Trump appointment

435
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:39,120
is RFK Jr. Did you just nominate the

436
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:41,760
time cube guy? Why not? It rotates in

437
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:44,160
four different directions simultaneously

438
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:46,320
toward midday, midnight, sun, sunown. It

439
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:48,880
rotates those directions simultaneously.

440
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:51,360
RFK Jr. who believes in chemtrails but

441
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:53,520
not vaccines, who claims CO 19 was

442
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:55,760
ethnically targeted to spare Jews and

443
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:58,080
the Chinese, who denies that AIDS is

444
00:18:55,760 --> 00:19:02,960
caused by HIV, who's promised that he

445
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:03,720
quote won't take sides on 9/11.

446
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,240
He

447
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:08,240
forgot. So, conspiracy theories are no

448
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:10,400
longer for freaks and tinfoil hats

449
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:12,880
making public access TV shows about

450
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,960
Sasquatch. If that's all it was, I

451
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,480
wouldn't care. It's not my business what

452
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,720
you people do with Sasquatch in the

453
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,320
privacy of your own bedroom. But now

454
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,919
conspiracy theories are for the freaks

455
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:24,160
who run the country. And when it comes

456
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:26,559
to deciding, you know, which elections

457
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:29,360
are rigged or which mass tragedies are

458
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:31,679
hoaxes or which reptilians control the

459
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:33,280
central banks, it kind of becomes

460
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:35,520
everyone's business. Because for

461
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,880
democracy to work, you know, if that's

462
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:39,120
still a thing by the time this video

463
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,640
comes out, we the people need to have

464
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,480
reasonable conversations with each

465
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:44,640
other. And it's very hard to have

466
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,480
reasonable conversations with people who

467
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:49,200
think the World Health Organization is

468
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:52,400
controlled by highlevel luciferian

469
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:54,720
druids. So in this video, I just want to

470
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:57,320
ask some questions not about any

471
00:19:54,720 --> 00:20:00,080
particular conspiracy theory, but about

472
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:01,760
conspiracism as a way of thinking. Why

473
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:04,080
do so many people believe in conspiracy

474
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:06,400
theories? Why are they so obsessed with

475
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:09,280
symbols and rituals? Why are they taking

476
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:11,919
over politics? Has this happened before?

477
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:13,919
When did this start? Is the internet to

478
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:16,240
blame? A funny thing about conspiracy

479
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:18,720
theories is no matter how wrong they

480
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:21,280
are, engaging with them forces you to

481
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:23,840
ask deep questions. Because there really

482
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:26,320
is something mysterious about truth and

483
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:28,880
power. How do we know what's true? What

484
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:31,120
authorities can we trust? Why do bad

485
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:34,159
things happen? Why are there wars? Why

486
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:36,799
is there poverty? Who really controls

487
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:40,320
the world? In this video, I will answer

488
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:43,120
all of these questions and more. So,

489
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:45,679
buckle your seat belt, Kansas. We're

490
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:51,799
going to take the rabbit pill and find

491
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:51,799
out just how deep Dorothy's hole goes.

492
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:57,469
[Music]

493
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:30,960
Part two, the rabbit

494
00:21:28,039 --> 00:21:32,880
pill. Hello, Earthlings. Hope you're

495
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:34,720
having a good trip. Let's start by

496
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,799
looking at how conspiracy theorists

497
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:38,480
argue. I need to teach you to counter

498
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:40,960
those arguments so you can properly

499
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:42,880
shill for the Galactic Empire. A common

500
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:45,520
argument goes like this. Aren't there

501
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:47,039
endless examples of real conspiracies?

502
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:49,760
Everyone always thinks conspiracy

503
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:53,200
theories are crazy until those theories

504
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:54,960
are proven to be conspiracy fact. As a

505
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,480
Trump supporter on Truth Social put it,

506
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,880
"Not trusting the government doesn't

507
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:01,280
make you a conspiracy theorist. It makes

508
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:04,159
you a history buff." So, on the one

509
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:06,320
hand, yes, the government has done

510
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:09,120
things that are bad. They've even

511
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:10,640
deliberately done bad things in secret,

512
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,480
which might be the definition of a

513
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,080
conspiracy. And that's true of whatever

514
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,559
country you live in, but I'm going to

515
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:18,480
focus on the US because the Saturnian

516
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:20,640
order has commanded me to make America

517
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:23,039
look bad. Easiest job they've ever given

518
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:26,159
me. To choose a popular example, Project

519
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:28,559
MK Ultra was a wildly unethical CIA mind

520
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:32,080
control experiment carried out in secret

521
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:34,320
between 1953 and 1973. One of its goals

522
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:37,039
was to develop a truth serum using

523
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:38,960
substances like LSD and morphine. Now,

524
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:41,440
obviously, this did not work because

525
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:44,480
morphine and LSD are terrible truth

526
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:46,159
serums. Trust me, I've tried. We know

527
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,480
about MK Ultra because after the

528
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:50,880
Watergate scandal, Congress investigated

529
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:52,960
intelligence agency abuses and uncovered

530
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:55,360
CIA documents that were supposed to have

531
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:57,520
been destroyed. The details are very

532
00:22:55,360 --> 00:23:00,400
scandalous. In an operation known as

533
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:03,200
Midnight Climax, the CIA lured men into

534
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:05,520
San Francisco, dosed them unknowingly

535
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:07,520
with LSD, and observed their behavior

536
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:09,760
through a one-way mirror. In another

537
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:11,760
experiment, US Army biologist Frank

538
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:14,000
Olsen was given LSD without his

539
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,600
knowledge or consent, and he died one

540
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,520
week later after falling from a

541
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:20,799
13thstory hotel window under suspicious

542
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:23,039
circumstances. It's true that there's no

543
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:24,880
shortage of real conspiracies. I'll put

544
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:26,960
some on the screen right now and you can

545
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,880
do your own research. So, you can't

546
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:31,039
really blame people for wondering if

547
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:32,799
this is the stuff that's declassified,

548
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:34,960
what else are they doing that we don't

549
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:36,640
know about? Probably a bunch of messed

550
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:39,200
up stuff. I'm not going to disagree with

551
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:41,360
you there. And many conspiracy theories

552
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,919
do have some kind of resemblance to

553
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:45,120
things that actually happened.

554
00:23:42,919 --> 00:23:48,480
Antivaccination conspiracy theories are

555
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:50,960
almost entirely baseless. But in 2011,

556
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:53,200
the CIA located Osama bin Laden in

557
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:55,440
Pakistan by secretly collecting blood

558
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:58,000
samples under the pretext of a fake

559
00:23:55,440 --> 00:24:00,480
vaccination program. QAnon is total

560
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,799
madness. But when high-profile men like

561
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:05,120
Epstein or Diddy are outed as prolific

562
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:07,120
sex criminals, it's not unreasonable to

563
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:09,520
wonder how many other rich and famous

564
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:11,159
people are complicit in those crimes.

565
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:13,200
So, with so much evidence of real

566
00:24:11,159 --> 00:24:15,679
conspiracies, why shouldn't we take the

567
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:17,600
rabbit pill and go down Dorothy's hole?

568
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:20,080
Well, in short, because conspiracy

569
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:22,240
theories have less in common with real

570
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:24,559
conspiracies than might initially seem

571
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:26,640
to be the case. Conspiracists will tell

572
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:29,440
you that the term conspiracy theory was

573
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:32,000
invented by the CIA to discredit anyone

574
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:34,400
who questions official narratives. Uh,

575
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,320
this is not true. Quote, recorded use of

576
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:39,039
the phrase conspiracy theory dates back

577
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:41,279
to at least 1863, more than 60 years

578
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:43,600
before the CIA was established. That's

579
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:45,600
according to the Associated Press, but I

580
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:47,600
guess that's the mainstream media and we

581
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:49,600
can't trust them. I only trust truth

582
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,799
seekers posting about medbeds from a

583
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,480
garage and telling me to buy

584
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:54,159
cryptocurrency. When the quantum

585
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:56,720
financial system hits and I finally get

586
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:58,799
my Nasara Gasara deposit, you'll see.

587
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:00,799
You'll all see the difference between

588
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:03,200
actual conspiracies and conspiracy

589
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:05,279
theories has to do with evidence. When

590
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:07,360
we talk about conspiracy theories, we're

591
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:09,240
not talking about scientific theories

592
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:11,600
like the theory of gravity, which is a

593
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:13,600
wellsubstantiated hypothesis. At least

594
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:15,440
for you people, it's actually completely

595
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:17,360
false. But they won't let me talk about

596
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:19,919
that. We're using the word theory in the

597
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:22,320
non-scientific sense of unsubstantiated

598
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:24,799
conjecture and speculation. Just a

599
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:26,799
theory, as in the theory that Katy Perry

600
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:29,360
is John Bené Ramsay or that Jeffrey

601
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:31,520
Epstein is a 300-year-old vampire who

602
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:33,320
used to be Andrew Jackson. Conspiracy

603
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:35,919
theories are by definition

604
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:38,400
unsubstantiated in the way that UFOs are

605
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:40,400
by definition unidentified. If you know

606
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,880
what the object is, then it's not an

607
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:45,440
unidentified flying object. If credible

608
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:47,440
sources confirm a conspiracy occurred,

609
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:49,760
then it's not a conspiracy theory. And

610
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:52,159
to conspiracy theorists, a confirmed

611
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:54,640
conspiracy becomes part of the official

612
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:56,880
narrative, part of the puppet show, and

613
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:58,559
is therefore itself something to be

614
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,559
questioned. You see this all the time

615
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:02,400
with MK Ultra, where the actual

616
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:04,880
documented events only interest

617
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:07,679
conspiracy theorists in so far as they

618
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:09,760
inspire unsubstantiated speculation that

619
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:12,240
what we know is just the tip of the

620
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:14,279
iceberg. So conspiracy theories are to

621
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:17,600
investigative journalism as

622
00:26:14,279 --> 00:26:19,760
cryptozoolology is to zoology. Zoology,

623
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:22,360
the study of animals, is a scientific

624
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:24,000
endeavor based on standards of evidence.

625
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:26,799
Cryptozoolology, the search for

626
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:29,039
Bigfoots, yetis, various mothmen, is a

627
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:31,279
crock-pot monster hunting activity based

628
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:33,279
on a parascientific pursuit of mystery

629
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:35,360
for the sake of mystery. Not to be too

630
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:37,600
harsh on cryptozoolology. I'd rather

631
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:39,360
people hunt Mothmen than do KQAnon. If

632
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:41,360
you're torn between the two, I want you

633
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:43,679
to promise me that you will not rest

634
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:45,679
until you have that moth man's head.

635
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:47,039
Cryptozoolology is not a science.

636
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:49,200
Because when a new species is

637
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:51,520
scientifically acknowledged, it's no

638
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,080
longer crypto, no longer secret, and is

639
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,960
therefore outside the domain of

640
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:57,840
cryptozoolology. When the unknown

641
00:26:54,960 --> 00:27:00,559
becomes the known, its mystique is gone.

642
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:02,240
And the mystique is the entire point.

643
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:03,840
This is why conspiracy theorists have

644
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:06,000
always been obsessed with secret

645
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:08,480
societies like the Freemasons or the

646
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,799
Illuminati. What interests them is

647
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:13,360
secrecy itself. YouTube is full of

648
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:16,159
videos like hidden camera exposes

649
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:18,559
Freemason rituals or like forbidden

650
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:20,240
videos inside the Mormon temple.

651
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:22,480
Incredibly boring things become

652
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:24,320
obsessively fascinating if you simply

653
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:25,919
tell people that it's secret and they're

654
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:28,080
not allowed to know about it. The

655
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:30,240
conspiracist classic None Dare Call It

656
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:32,320
Conspiracy by Gary Allen, a major

657
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:35,039
influence on Alex Jones, describes

658
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:37,200
conspiracy research as quote history's

659
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:39,520
greatest who done it. a mystery

660
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:41,360
thriller. I think this reveals a lot

661
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:44,240
about the conspiracist mindset.

662
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:46,159
Conspiracy research is a thrillseeking

663
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:48,000
activity. People don't become conspiracy

664
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:49,440
theorists because they followed rational

665
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,960
arguments to an evidence-based

666
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:52,799
conclusion. Which is not to say that

667
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:54,799
conspiracy theorists aren't interested

668
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:57,120
in evidence. They're very interested in

669
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:59,080
evidence. They accumulate vast webs of

670
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:01,360
evidence. They're passionate about

671
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:03,919
investigation, about doing their own

672
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:06,159
research. 9/11 truthers will often give

673
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:07,840
at least a superficial impression of

674
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:10,000
being well-versed in structural

675
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:12,240
engineering. They present facts about

676
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,720
the temperature at which jet fuel burns.

677
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:15,679
They start using words like

678
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:17,520
nanoothermite. They have confident

679
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:19,120
opinions about whether building 7 could

680
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,799
have collapsed from fire. But I think

681
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:22,480
it's a mistake to see conspiracy

682
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:24,640
discourse as some kind of botched

683
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:27,200
attempt at rational inquiry. I don't

684
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:28,720
think it is, but why not? There's a

685
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:31,200
particular type of evidence that

686
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:34,559
conspiracy theorists usually rely on.

687
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:36,840
what they call anomalies. An anomaly is

688
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:40,080
anything that seems subjectively

689
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:42,799
suspicious, improbable, or inexplicable,

690
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:45,520
a glitch in the matrix. For example, the

691
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:47,919
Apollo 11 press conference is constantly

692
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:50,559
cited by moonlanding hoaxers because the

693
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:53,039
astronauts appear at times dejected and

694
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:55,279
morose. Conspiracy theorists interpret

695
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:57,039
this anomaly as proof that the

696
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:58,960
astronauts are being forced to

697
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:01,600
perpetrate a scam on the American

698
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:03,919
people. Poor men. clearly under threat

699
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:06,080
of death if they reveal the truth that

700
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:07,760
they went nowhere near the moon. I'm

701
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:09,840
trying to be open-minded here, but their

702
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:11,760
body language says they never went

703
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:14,000
anywhere. I've seen people more hyped

704
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:16,679
about a visit to the mall. Isn't it also

705
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:20,080
possible that they were, I don't know,

706
00:29:16,679 --> 00:29:21,840
tired after flying to the moon? Because

707
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:24,320
everyone on the internet is an expert

708
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:26,480
body language analyst. So, what do I

709
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:28,880
know? In the summer of 2020, a

710
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:30,640
conspiracy theory spread on social media

711
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:32,960
claiming that missing children were

712
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:35,679
being trafficked by online furniture

713
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:38,880
retailer Wayfair. The evidence for this

714
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:40,799
conspiracy was an anomaly on Wayfair's

715
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:43,679
website, where certain pillows and

716
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:45,919
cabinets were listed for $10,000, an

717
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:48,240
outrageously inflated price. Some of

718
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:50,480
these items had names that just so

719
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:52,320
happened to correspond to names of

720
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:54,399
children who'd been reported missing.

721
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:56,720
People on Twitter started wondering,

722
00:29:54,399 --> 00:30:00,720
"Wasn't it possible these children were

723
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:03,279
being sold into depraved sexual slavery

724
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:05,200
and trafficked inside of pillows and

725
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:06,880
cabinets?" A lot of people jumped to

726
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:09,520
that conclusion without stopping to

727
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:11,840
consider alternative explanations. Like,

728
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:14,080
for example, maybe there was an error on

729
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:16,720
the website. Maybe the products were

730
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:18,880
named by SEO optimization algorithms

731
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:21,520
looking for frequently searched names.

732
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:23,919
Or maybe giving human names to products

733
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:26,080
is just a fairly common marketing

734
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:29,039
practice. The Stephanie upholstered

735
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:31,360
armchair. The Vanna tufted sofa. This

736
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:34,080
one's not even on Wayfair. Adilia is at

737
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:36,240
Home Depot. My god, this goes all the

738
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:37,679
way to the top. Don't worry, Adilia.

739
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:39,520
We'll break you out of your velvet

740
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:41,279
prison. The Wayfair missing children did

741
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:43,200
later turn up, by the way. One

742
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:45,440
18-year-old girl went live on Facebook

743
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:48,000
to reassure the public that she was fine

744
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:49,840
and not in fact being sex trafficked

745
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,320
inside of a cabinet, but conspiracy

746
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:54,159
theorists in the chat were not relieved.

747
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:56,320
In fact, they were annoyed that their

748
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:58,640
investigation was being debunked. One

749
00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:00,480
woman commented, "Put our ass back in

750
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:02,559
the cabinet." For a more convincing

751
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:05,200
example of the argument from Anomalies,

752
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:07,200
let's look at Loose Change, the 2005

753
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:09,360
documentary that defined the 9/11

754
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:11,880
truther movement. Loose change is

755
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:14,240
essentially just a big list of 9/11

756
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:18,000
anomalies, including some that actually

757
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:20,159
are pretty, well, anomalous, like the

758
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,640
discovery of a hijacker's passport at

759
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:24,159
ground zero. Seven different black boxes

760
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:25,760
made from the most resilient materials

761
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:29,360
known to man were all completely

762
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:31,200
destroyed beyond repair. Yet, a passport

763
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:33,840
made from a fragile material known as

764
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:35,679
paper managed to fly through a 2,000°

765
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:37,679
explosion and land undamaged blocks

766
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:39,679
away, where the FBI conveniently found

767
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:42,559
it, thereby incriminating Satam Al-

768
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:45,279
Sakami and al-Qaeda for the attacks. Who

769
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:47,919
writes this stuff? Isn't it weird that a

770
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:51,039
passport would survive a 2,000 degree

771
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:54,159
explosion? Like, yeah, it is extremely

772
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:57,039
weird. How do we explain that? Well, my

773
00:31:54,159 --> 00:32:00,080
explanation is that sometimes weird

774
00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:02,799
things happen. In 1987, Northwest

775
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:06,080
Airlines Flight 255 crashed shortly

776
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:08,080
after takeoff in Detroit, killing 156

777
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:11,120
people. Everyone on the plane died

778
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:13,279
except for one 4-year-old girl. How

779
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:15,919
could a 4-year-old survive a plane crash

780
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:18,399
that killed more than 100 adults? Isn't

781
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:20,880
that anomalous? It's super [ __ ]

782
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:23,039
anomalous. But you know what? Sometimes

783
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:24,880
anomalous things happen. How did the

784
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:27,279
hijacker's passport end up at ground

785
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:29,600
zero? Well, I really don't know. Maybe

786
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:31,519
God guided the passport to safety. Maybe

787
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:33,600
an al-Qaeda operative handed it to

788
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:35,440
police because they wanted to get

789
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:38,240
caught. Maybe it was planted by a

790
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:39,679
reptilian. It was me. I did it. Me and

791
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:42,000
my close personal friend Hillary

792
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:43,840
Clinton. None of this is plausible. But

793
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,840
is it more plausible that the Bush

794
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:48,159
administration planted such a weird

795
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:49,760
piece of ultimately superfluous evidence

796
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:51,840
in the course of orchestrating the

797
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:54,559
secret controlled demolition of the

798
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:56,640
tallest buildings in New York City and

799
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:58,720
that no one involved in any stage of

800
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:00,960
that process has leaked anything about

801
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:03,120
it for over two decades? God, am I

802
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:05,200
really debating 911 truthers online?

803
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:07,279
Have I really learned nothing in 23

804
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:09,200
years? The thing about anomalies is that

805
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:11,200
they never really amount to any kind of

806
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:13,279
substantive evidence that a conspiracy

807
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,960
occurred. The argument from anomalies is

808
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:17,600
often just a series of statements

809
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:19,600
beginning, "Isn't it weird? Isn't it

810
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:20,919
weird that cabinets on Wayfair are

811
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,880
listed for

812
00:33:20,919 --> 00:33:25,519
$10,000? Oh my god, that's really

813
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:27,760
anomalous. Isn't it weird that Sirius,

814
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:30,399
the hero dog of 9/11, was photographed

815
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:33,840
with Bill Clinton exactly one year

816
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:36,720
before the attack?" Yes, it's weird. You

817
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:38,720
have proven that a weird thing happened,

818
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:40,519
but that's all you've proven. It's a

819
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:43,519
style of argument based entirely on

820
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:45,760
innuendo, conjecture, and asking leading

821
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:47,919
questions designed to push the audience

822
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:49,440
to a speculative conclusion. It's like

823
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:51,519
that History Channel show Ancient

824
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:53,440
Aliens, where the phrase, "Is it

825
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:56,080
possible?" occurs with comical

826
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:58,720
frequency. Is it possible that Bigfoot

827
00:33:56,080 --> 00:34:01,519
is actually an extraterrestrial? Is it

828
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:04,080
possible the moon is not only hollow but

829
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:06,799
an artificial structure? Is it possible

830
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:09,280
that the story of the Minotaur is based

831
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:12,079
on actual events? Is it possible that

832
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:14,480
the octopus didn't originate on Earth?

833
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:15,320
Is it possible that what we have here

834
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:17,599
are

835
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:20,000
extraterrestrials wearing some type of

836
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:22,639
protective suits? Is it even possible

837
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,639
that Nessie is an alien entity that is

838
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:27,520
able to pass through a wormhole that

839
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:30,480
exists at Loch Ness? Like yes, lots of

840
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:32,159
things are possible because possibility

841
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:34,720
requires a very low threshold of

842
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:37,359
evidence. It's possible the moon is

843
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:39,839
controlled by reptiles. It's possible

844
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:42,000
that life is but a dream. This rhetoric

845
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:44,320
of asking leading questions functions in

846
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,240
part as disavowel because technically

847
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:48,560
you're not making any claims. You're

848
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:51,119
just asking questions. But it also

849
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:52,720
provokes the imagination of the audience

850
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:55,200
and makes you feel like you're

851
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:57,520
connecting the dots on your own. And

852
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:59,520
that's exciting. It's engaging. It makes

853
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:01,760
you feel smart, like you're an

854
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:03,920
independent investigator, a free

855
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:06,320
thinker. You're not a sheep who believes

856
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:10,440
whatever the mockingb birdstream media

857
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:13,599
forces down your throat. You do your own

858
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:15,359
research. But do you? No, Patrick.

859
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:17,520
Scrolling Telegram channels about how

860
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:19,440
the Knights Templar are using 5G

861
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:21,920
networks to make you eat bugs is not

862
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:24,160
research. No one likes to feel like a

863
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:26,800
passive receiver of information. Okay.

864
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:28,400
Well, some people do. Flea Bag, maybe. I

865
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:30,800
want someone to tell me what to eat,

866
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:32,880
what to like, what to hate, what to rage

867
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:35,359
about. But conspiracy theories appeal to

868
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:37,119
people who want to feel in control of

869
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:38,560
their beliefs. And I do kind of

870
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:40,720
sympathize with that. I don't want to

871
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:42,160
get knowledge cucked by some high priest

872
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:43,599
telling me what to believe. This

873
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:46,000
attitude is not at all unique to

874
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:48,560
conspiracy theorists. Individualist

875
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,640
skepticism is sort of the foundation of

876
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:52,480
Western philosophy. The modern era in

877
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:54,640
philosophy starts with Decart who wanted

878
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:56,560
to question everything. In the Middle

879
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:58,640
Ages, you had to accept the doctrines of

880
00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:01,440
the church or they'd call you a heretic

881
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:02,960
and they'd burn you. But Deart thought

882
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:05,440
that knowledge shouldn't be based on

883
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:07,280
dogma. It should be based on reason. And

884
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:09,640
that does sound good, doesn't it? The

885
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:12,000
problem though is that if you question

886
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:14,320
everything, then how do you know that

887
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,160
anything is true? Decar argued you can't

888
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:17,760
even trust your own senses because you

889
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:20,320
could be dreaming right now. You could

890
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:22,160
be deceived by an evil demon. So Deart

891
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:24,079
wanted to discover an idea that could

892
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:27,280
not be doubted. And he came up with this

893
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:31,440
Latin slogan kitosum. I think therefore

894
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:33,599
I am which has to be true because it's

895
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:35,280
on t-shirts and coffee mugs. Popular

896
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:38,160
everywhere among people who want you to

897
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:40,400
know they went to college. From the kito

898
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:42,320
Decart tried to deduce that God exists

899
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,839
and that God wouldn't allow a demon to

900
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:45,760
deceive you. It's not a very good

901
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:48,560
argument. Decart is not a good

902
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:48,560
philosopher.

903
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:54,079
The problem is that knowledge is

904
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:55,599
inherently a collective endeavor. And

905
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:57,440
that's even more true now than it was in

906
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:59,359
Daycart's time. You can't really do

907
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:01,119
science by yourself anymore. To some

908
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:03,040
extent, you have to trust the work of

909
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:05,040
other people. Conspiracy theorists don't

910
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:06,720
trust science because science is an

911
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:08,560
institution and they don't trust

912
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:10,480
institutions. A lot of conspiracy

913
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:12,880
theorists go even further than that and

914
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:15,040
they adopt this oppositional attitude to

915
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:17,520
knowledge. In other words, whatever they

916
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:19,520
want you to believe, the opposite is

917
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:21,359
probably true. On a YouTube clip of

918
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:23,520
Richard Nixon telling Billy Graham that

919
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:26,720
there will be a poker in America if the

920
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:29,119
Jews quote don't start behaving, the top

921
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:31,680
comment reads, "I always wondered why I

922
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:33,760
was conditioned to dislike Nixon by the

923
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:36,240
media. Things are starting to make

924
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:38,560
sense." This idea that every mainstream

925
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:42,560
source of information is conditioning

926
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:45,359
from the JudeoBevik banking cabal leads

927
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:47,599
to a kind of fetish for stigmatized and

928
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:50,240
secret knowledge. Conspiracy theorists

929
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:52,400
play up how persecuted and silenced they

930
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:54,560
are because they see institutional

931
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:57,119
opposition as proof of their

932
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:59,200
correctness. An Austrian painter and

933
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:03,040
conspiracy theorist once said in his

934
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:04,880
book, "My struggle." Oh, poor baby. My

935
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:07,520
struggle. He should have just called it

936
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:09,359
my journey, my whole entire journey. He

937
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:11,520
wrote that the media's insistence on the

938
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:13,839
protocols of the elders of Zion being an

939
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:15,920
anti-semitic hoax is quote the best

940
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:17,680
proof that they are authentic. This is

941
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:19,920
one reason why conspiracy theories are

942
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:22,640
impossible to debunk. The attempt to

943
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:25,200
debunk them is seen as shilling and

944
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:28,160
therefore as proof of the conspiracy. If

945
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:30,560
it isn't true, why are you so eager to

946
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:32,920
disprove it? Conspiracists see the

947
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:35,359
media, the academy, the medical

948
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:38,320
establishment, every reputable source of

949
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:40,640
information as a kind of cartasian demon

950
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:43,200
lulling us all into a dream world from

951
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:45,359
which their goal is to awake. And it's

952
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:46,960
this experience of awakening that

953
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:49,119
conspiracy theorists are trying to

954
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:52,079
trigger with an overwhelming gish gallop

955
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:54,560
of anomalies that eventually climaxes in

956
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:57,040
a wild leap in logic. The most egregious

957
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:59,520
example of this possibly ever is the

958
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:02,320
Dutch conspiracy theorist Janet Oabard's

959
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:04,240
10-part video essay Fall of the Cabal,

960
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:07,280
which recruited millions of people into

961
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:09,520
QAnon in 2019 and 2020. Fall of the

962
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:12,240
Cabal begins with a section called

963
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:14,800
Things That Made Me Go H. What I'm going

964
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:17,920
to do is first of all give you a short

965
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:20,560
overview of things that made me go hm.

966
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:23,839
things that made me go, "hm" is just a

967
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:26,880
random list of anomalies, not arguments,

968
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:29,599
just questions. Isn't it weird? Isn't it

969
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:32,560
weird that the Vatican's audience hall

970
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:34,480
is full of references to reptilians? Did

971
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:36,880
you know the Vatican's telescope is

972
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:39,260
called Lucifer? And since when does the

973
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:42,479
Pope make the sign of the devil?

974
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:42,479
[Music]

975
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:47,200
911. Wow, that's really anomalous. Are

976
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:50,079
you aware of the fact that children

977
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:51,560
cartoons contain subliminal messages of

978
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:54,240
sex and

979
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:56,640
violence? Why? That's super [ __ ]

980
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:58,400
anomalous. Fall of the Cabal does allude

981
00:39:56,640 --> 00:40:00,960
to a few things that are real. Like,

982
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:03,200
yes, Monsanto and Buyer are companies

983
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:05,040
that make carcinogenic herbicides.

984
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:07,520
That's true. But then that's just

985
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:09,680
casually mixed in with, you know, blood

986
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:12,480
liel. Do you realize that these four

987
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:17,599
skins are actually sold? That it's a

988
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:19,280
trade? What's next? Drinking baby blood?

989
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:21,200
Look, what is the point of this? There's

990
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:22,880
no logical connection between any of

991
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:24,800
these points. It's just a bunch of

992
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:27,119
ominous innuendo leading the viewer to

993
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:30,079
the vague conclusion that something

994
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:32,640
isn't adding up. We've been lied to. And

995
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:35,040
that is always the preface. We've been

996
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:37,280
lied to. What is the purpose of opening

997
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:39,280
with that? Well, if you can make your

998
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:42,079
audience feel like everything they've

999
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:44,960
ever been told is a lie, like science is

1000
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:47,760
fake, like school is indoctrination, the

1001
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:50,160
news is propaganda, the so-called fact

1002
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:52,640
checkers are dangerous. The so-called

1003
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:54,320
fact checkers are dangerous. It leaves

1004
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:56,480
the audience in a very vulnerable

1005
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:58,800
position because now they have nowhere

1006
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:00,319
to turn for reliable information because

1007
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:02,880
you've convinced them not to trust

1008
00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:05,599
anyone and now they don't know what to

1009
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:07,359
believe. And if you're a propagandist,

1010
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:09,040
that's exactly where you want them.

1011
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:11,119
Because most people are uncomfortable

1012
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:13,599
with doubt and uncertainty. It leaves

1013
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:16,640
you open to alternative explanations,

1014
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:19,280
even bad ones, because any explanation

1015
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:20,800
feels better than none. So this is the

1016
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:23,280
critical moment when you make the

1017
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:26,000
logical leap into hyperspace. You've

1018
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:28,240
broken the audience down, and now you

1019
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:30,480
get to build them back up. You get to be

1020
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:32,640
the Morpheus telling them how deep the

1021
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:34,640
rabbit hole goes. And you may as well go

1022
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:36,800
ham because at this point they'll just

1023
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:39,200
believe anything you say. Get ready for

1024
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:42,319
some conspiracy facts. The North

1025
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:44,800
American Man Boy Love Association. This

1026
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:47,240
is the mascot. Why are children exposed

1027
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:49,520
to Illuminati symbols? Chemtrails.

1028
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:51,920
Cannibalism. George Soros. The

1029
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:55,200
Rothschild family. Follow the money.

1030
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:58,160
Adrenochrome is real. It is the ultimate

1031
00:41:55,200 --> 00:42:00,640
drug. The same church of Satan Chelsea

1032
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:03,119
Clinton is so fond of. If you can really

1033
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:05,599
jump from one timeline to another

1034
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:08,400
parallel one, you can time travel. I

1035
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:12,160
have grown to fully trust Dawn, master

1036
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:16,240
of all masters. He is a genius, a 5D

1037
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:20,280
chess player, a man with a huge heart.

1038
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:20,280
Hugh is not a cult.

1039
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:25,520
The most insidious thing about this form

1040
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:28,079
of indoctrination is that to the people

1041
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:30,079
susceptible to it, it feels like

1042
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:32,400
critical thinking. They think they're

1043
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:34,880
connecting the dots, asking questions

1044
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:37,680
the sheeple can't handle. They noticed

1045
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:40,319
the anomalies. They followed the money.

1046
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:42,319
No one told them what to think. Except

1047
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:44,319
you kind of did tell them what to think.

1048
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:46,319
You just did it in a way that made them

1049
00:42:44,319 --> 00:42:47,839
feel like it was their idea. And when

1050
00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:50,160
people feel like something is their

1051
00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:53,119
idea, they internalize it as part of

1052
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:54,960
their identity. They become possessive

1053
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:57,280
of it. Where they once may have been

1054
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:59,440
open to skepticism, they'll now be on

1055
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:02,160
guard against it, ready to dismiss it

1056
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:04,480
reflexively as shilling. So, the point

1057
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:06,800
of the argument from Anomalies is not to

1058
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:09,359
support a conclusion with evidence. The

1059
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:11,440
point is to trigger a crisis of belief

1060
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:14,160
that primes the audience for a kind of

1061
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:16,560
conversion experience, an initiation

1062
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:18,400
into the cult of mystery, of secret

1063
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:20,319
alternative knowledge. And that

1064
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:23,119
conversion experience is called the

1065
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:25,040
awakening. Going down the rabbit hole,

1066
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:27,440
taking the red pill. It's hard to

1067
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:29,599
overstate the influence of 1999

1068
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:32,240
cyberpunk science fiction film The

1069
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:34,560
Matrix. A great movie whose legacy is

1070
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:36,880
unfortunately tainted by association

1071
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:39,119
with every manner of Looney Tunes

1072
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:41,119
buffoonery. The Matrix became the

1073
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:44,000
centerpiece of 21st century mythology

1074
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:46,400
that it is because its allegory of

1075
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,480
awakening from a dream is a universal

1076
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:51,040
archetype. In western philosophy,

1077
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:52,880
there's Plato's cave, Decart's demon.

1078
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:55,040
Lenin says the revolution will arrive

1079
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:56,880
with the worker's awakening of class

1080
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:59,200
consciousness. In Hindu and Buddhist

1081
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:01,520
thought, the illusion is called Maya, a

1082
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:03,920
deceit that conceals the true nature of

1083
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:06,240
things. What's called enlightenment by

1084
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:08,560
Western Buddhists is a 19th century

1085
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:10,880
translation of the poly term bodhi,

1086
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:13,440
which is more literally translated as

1087
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:14,960
awakening. So, The Matrix can mean

1088
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:16,720
whatever you want it to mean. The

1089
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:18,560
directors of the movie now claim that

1090
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:20,079
it's an allegory for transgender

1091
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:22,400
awakening. But whatever your

1092
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:24,880
interpretation, taking the red pill is

1093
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:26,800
to awake from a dream world. It's a

1094
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:28,720
revelation that explains the feeling

1095
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:31,440
you've had all your life that something

1096
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:34,480
is vaguely wrong. You don't know what it

1097
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:37,359
is, but it's there like a splinter in

1098
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:39,920
your mind. By taking the red pill, Neo

1099
00:44:37,359 --> 00:44:42,240
underos a right of passage, symbolically

1100
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:44,400
dying in the dream world to be reborn in

1101
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:46,640
the desert of the real. For Neo, this

1102
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:49,359
also entails the realization that he is

1103
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:51,359
in fact the main character of reality,

1104
00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:53,359
which also probably speaks to something

1105
00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:55,440
in the conspiracist mindset. When

1106
00:44:53,359 --> 00:44:57,440
conspiracy theorists tell you to wake

1107
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:59,040
up, they're not trying to persuade you

1108
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:01,280
about the causes of a particular

1109
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:02,800
historical event. They're urging you to

1110
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:05,760
transform the way you think about the

1111
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:08,079
world in general. Dylan Lewis Monroe's Q

1112
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:10,400
web diagram connects the dots from

1113
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:13,079
Atlantis to the Rothschilds to the

1114
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:15,800
Vatican to 9/11 to reptilian

1115
00:45:13,079 --> 00:45:19,040
extraterrestrials to Obama's fake birth

1116
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:21,280
certificate. It's all connected in the Q

1117
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:23,680
web. The Western pyramidal hierarchy has

1118
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:25,800
been replaced with a mesmerizing eastern

1119
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:28,000
tangle which the authors of

1120
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:30,119
conspirituality compare to a Buddhist

1121
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:33,359
mandelola meant to guide the viewer to

1122
00:45:30,119 --> 00:45:35,090
awakening. So, what is it the conspiracy

1123
00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:40,050
theorists are awakening

1124
00:45:35,090 --> 00:45:40,050
[Music]

1125
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:48,680
to? Wake

1126
00:45:44,599 --> 00:45:51,760
up. Part three,

1127
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:54,000
conspiracism. So, wake up to what? Well,

1128
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:56,480
like every convert, conspiracists are

1129
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:58,800
awakening to a new worldview, which I'm

1130
00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:01,040
calling conspiracism. And yes, it

1131
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:03,760
deserves to be an ism because it's not a

1132
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:05,760
theory. It's a way of thinking. The

1133
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:08,400
details constantly change, but the

1134
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:11,280
fundamental mindset remains the same. In

1135
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:13,280
his 1964 essay, the paranoid style in

1136
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:15,119
American politics, historian Richard

1137
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:17,440
Hoffadder said that conspiracist

1138
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:19,760
thinking was not unique to his own era

1139
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:21,760
of hysteria about looming one world

1140
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:23,200
communist government. He tracked its

1141
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:25,119
roots all the way back to the founding

1142
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:27,440
of the United States when there was a

1143
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:29,760
panic about the Bavarian Illuminati

1144
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:31,520
infiltrating the Freemasons and plotting

1145
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:35,040
to replace Christianity with

1146
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:36,960
jackabinical atheism. In 1798, Timothy

1147
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:39,119
Dwight, president of Yale University,

1148
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:41,680
said, quote, "Shall our sons become the

1149
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:44,400
disciples of Voltaare and the dragoons

1150
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:46,560
of Mara, or our daughters the concubines

1151
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:48,880
of the Illuminati?" The concubines of

1152
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:51,040
the Illuminati. I for one welcome my new

1153
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:52,960
sex lord Adam vice helped. When I heard

1154
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:54,880
he was professor of canon law at English

1155
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:56,960
dot I was like oh my god that's so

1156
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:58,480
[ __ ] hot. That same year George

1157
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:00,800
Washington received a letter from a

1158
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:03,119
German reverend warning him of a quote

1159
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:05,760
society of freemasons that distinguishes

1160
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:07,920
itself by the name of Illuminati whose

1161
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:10,319
plan is to overturn all government and

1162
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:13,119
all religion. This conspiracy theory was

1163
00:47:10,319 --> 00:47:15,920
popularized by John Robersonson's 1797

1164
00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:17,440
book proofs of a conspiracy against all

1165
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:18,800
the religions and governments of Europe

1166
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:20,480
carried on in the secret meetings of

1167
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:22,280
Freemasons, Illuminati and reading

1168
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:24,160
societies collected from good

1169
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:25,920
authorities. Well, if it's from good

1170
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:27,520
authorities. Washington wrote back,

1171
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:30,000
quote, I have heard much of the

1172
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:31,920
nefarious and dangerous plan and

1173
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,599
doctrines of the Illuminati, but he

1174
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:36,000
assured the minister that the Freemasons

1175
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:37,839
in America were not involved. So,

1176
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:40,319
conspiracism has existed for a long

1177
00:47:37,839 --> 00:47:42,720
time. Illuminati conspiracy nonsense

1178
00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:44,800
crossed George Washington's desk. But we

1179
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:46,880
could go back even further than that. In

1180
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:49,040
the year 64, there were conspiracy

1181
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:51,839
theories that the great fire of Rome was

1182
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:54,319
an inside job ordered by Emperor Nero.

1183
00:47:51,839 --> 00:47:56,880
Olive oil can't melt marble columns.

1184
00:47:54,319 --> 00:47:59,040
Nero, of course, blamed the Christians.

1185
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:01,520
Christians were in many ways the Jews of

1186
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:03,839
ancient Rome. Well, the Jews were also

1187
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:06,000
the Jews. They often are. So, this is

1188
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:07,760
not a new way of thinking. The internet

1189
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:10,079
did not start this. It's actually kind

1190
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:12,319
of amazing how consistent conspiracist

1191
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:14,000
rhetoric is across centuries. Another

1192
00:48:12,319 --> 00:48:16,640
passage from that letter to Washington

1193
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:18,800
reads, "Our present time, pregnant with

1194
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:20,560
the most shocking evils and calamities,

1195
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:22,880
threatens ruin to our liberty and

1196
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:24,960
government. Secret, the most secret

1197
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:26,960
plans are agitation." Like, it sounds

1198
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:28,800
like someone translated Alex Jones into

1199
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:30,559
18th century English. According to

1200
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:32,160
Hofstatter, the paranoid style is

1201
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:34,079
characterized by quote heated

1202
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:36,319
exaggeration, suspiciousness, and

1203
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:38,079
conspiratorial fantasy, as well as

1204
00:48:36,319 --> 00:48:40,200
feelings of persecution. It's

1205
00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:42,160
overheated, over suspicious,

1206
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:44,319
overaggressive, grandiose, and

1207
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:46,000
apocalyptic in expression. Sound like

1208
00:48:44,319 --> 00:48:47,680
anyone you know? But I think

1209
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:50,240
conspiracism is more than just a

1210
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:52,240
rhetorical style. It also has certain

1211
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:54,319
core beliefs. Political scientist

1212
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:56,720
Michael Barkon says the three principles

1213
00:48:54,319 --> 00:48:59,599
of conspiracism are nothing happens by

1214
00:48:56,720 --> 00:49:02,800
accident, nothing is as it seems, and

1215
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:03,920
everything is connected. I agree, but I

1216
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:06,880
want to use a slightly different

1217
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:08,520
definition because I do my own research.

1218
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:12,000
I'll call the three principles of

1219
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:14,400
conspiracism intentionalism, dualism,

1220
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:16,319
and symbolism. Now, pay attention

1221
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:18,160
because this will be on the test.

1222
00:49:16,319 --> 00:49:20,000
Intentionalism is the idea that

1223
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:21,760
everything that happens is the result of

1224
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:24,079
a deliberate plan. That there are

1225
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:26,400
shadowy agents of evil scheming behind

1226
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:28,319
every misfortune. There are no accidents

1227
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:30,720
and no significant event is the result

1228
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:32,800
of mere human ignorance or incompetence

1229
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:35,520
or of systemic forces beyond human

1230
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:37,680
intention. Dualism is the idea that all

1231
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:39,599
of human history and politics are best

1232
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:42,000
understood as an epic battle between

1233
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:44,400
good and evil. The forces of light

1234
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:46,079
against the forces of darkness. When bad

1235
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:48,319
things happen, when there are wars,

1236
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:50,880
disasters, poverty, these are simply the

1237
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:53,440
result of evil people doing evil things

1238
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:55,359
because they're evil. And finally,

1239
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:57,520
symbolism is the idea that everything

1240
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:59,440
has meaning and everything is connected.

1241
00:49:57,520 --> 00:50:01,960
So, politics and history are sort of

1242
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:03,839
astrological in nature. There are no

1243
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:05,520
coincidences. Everything is teameming

1244
00:50:03,839 --> 00:50:08,079
with signs and symbols that we can

1245
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:10,240
decode to discover the truth and define

1246
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:12,160
the future. Now, these are all pretty

1247
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:14,480
common patterns of thinking that most of

1248
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:16,480
us slip into sometimes. And not everyone

1249
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:18,800
who flirts with conspiracy theories is a

1250
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:20,640
full-blown conspiracist, but people who

1251
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:22,960
believe an all-encompassing super

1252
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:24,800
conspiracies like QAnon, the kind of

1253
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:26,480
people who think the deep state mapping

1254
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:28,839
project is an accurate depiction of

1255
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:30,800
reality, those people are full-blown

1256
00:50:28,839 --> 00:50:32,240
conspiracists. Now, let's explore the

1257
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:34,480
labyrinth of their madness in

1258
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:36,240
excruciating detail. It's okay. I've had

1259
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:38,640
a spiritual awakening. I've learned to

1260
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:41,720
enjoy losing subscribers. Conspiracist

1261
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:44,079
principle one,

1262
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:47,440
intentionalism. Hello, my pretties. In

1263
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:49,280
October 2024, conspiracist Congresswoman

1264
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:50,400
Marjgerie Taylor Green. Marjorie, if

1265
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:52,400
you're watching this, I've already put a

1266
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:54,160
hex on you. It's too late. In October,

1267
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:55,920
Marjorie posted a series of tweets

1268
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:57,680
arguing that severe hurricanes in the

1269
00:50:55,920 --> 00:51:00,079
southern United States were deliberately

1270
00:50:57,680 --> 00:51:02,800
geoengineered by government agencies to

1271
00:51:00,079 --> 00:51:05,040
suppress Republican voters. Damn, I wish

1272
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:06,960
it worked. A year earlier, Marjorie,

1273
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:08,960
[ __ ] Marjorie, tweeted that climate

1274
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:11,040
change is a scam perpetrated by quote,

1275
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:13,119
"very powerful people that are getting

1276
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:15,200
rich beyond their wildest dreams,

1277
00:51:13,119 --> 00:51:17,920
convincing many that carbon is the

1278
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:20,079
enemy." How can this woman believe that

1279
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:22,319
anthropogenic climate change is a hoax,

1280
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:24,720
but the National Oceanic and Atmospheric

1281
00:51:22,319 --> 00:51:27,119
Administration is planning each specific

1282
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:29,200
hurricane? Well, because she's an idiot,

1283
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:31,280
but also because she's a conspiracist.

1284
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:33,520
And conspiracists believe that nothing

1285
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:35,599
happens by accident. So they cannot

1286
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:37,440
grasp the concept that carbon emissions

1287
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:39,160
might cause climate problems as an

1288
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:40,720
unintended byproduct of

1289
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:42,640
industrialization. But they have no

1290
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:44,720
problem whatsoever believing that big

1291
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:46,720
government Satanists are using harp to

1292
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:48,480
create hurricanes. And the Rothschilds

1293
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:51,240
are starting forest fires in California

1294
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:53,280
with Jewish moon lasers. This is

1295
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:55,680
intentionalism. The idea that everything

1296
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:57,359
that happens is the result of someone's

1297
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:59,920
plan. And if it's not immediately

1298
00:51:57,359 --> 00:52:01,760
obvious whose plan it is, that must be

1299
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:04,000
because the plan is secret.

1300
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:06,079
Conspiracists see world events as a big

1301
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:08,319
puppet show. For every war, every

1302
00:52:06,079 --> 00:52:11,040
terrorist attack, every recession, every

1303
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:13,680
pandemic, every election, revolution, or

1304
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:16,000
so-called natural disaster, there must

1305
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:18,319
be a man behind the curtain pulling all

1306
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:20,480
the strings. In the most general sense,

1307
00:52:18,319 --> 00:52:23,200
intentionalism is a way of explaining

1308
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:26,240
why things happen. Why does a volcano

1309
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:28,640
erupt? Well, a scientist who cares about

1310
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:30,880
facts and data like a cuckled might say

1311
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:32,640
that the collision of tectonic plates

1312
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:35,040
forces magma through cracks in the

1313
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:37,280
Earth's crust, leading to an eruption.

1314
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:39,280
What a coincidence, but move along

1315
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:41,359
Sheeple. Nothing to see here. An

1316
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:44,000
intentionalist explanation would be that

1317
00:52:41,359 --> 00:52:46,559
volcanoes erupt because someone makes

1318
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:48,000
them erupt. And who that someone is

1319
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:50,480
depends on the specifics of your

1320
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:52,480
worldview. An animist or polytheist

1321
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:54,800
might say that a volcano erupts because

1322
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:56,880
the mountain is angry or the god of the

1323
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:59,440
mountain is angry. A monotheist might

1324
00:52:56,880 --> 00:53:02,319
just say because God is angry. Not all

1325
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:03,760
monotheists, but you know the type. Go

1326
00:53:02,319 --> 00:53:05,839
spawn. You just keep pushing on to the

1327
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:08,079
hell where you will forever burn. And a

1328
00:53:05,839 --> 00:53:10,640
conspiracist might say that volcanoes

1329
00:53:08,079 --> 00:53:12,240
erupt because the globalists are using

1330
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:14,400
volcanic smoke signals to

1331
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:16,480
numerologically communicate the dates of

1332
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:19,599
upcoming wars, recessions, and terrorist

1333
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:21,359
attacks. I predicted in 2022 globalists

1334
00:53:19,599 --> 00:53:23,760
would use Mount Edna smoke rings to

1335
00:53:21,359 --> 00:53:26,559
signal war. They have done it before. 8

1336
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:28,720
June 2000 equals 1 years 3 months 3 days

1337
00:53:26,559 --> 00:53:31,920
before the 9/11 attacks where buildings

1338
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:33,839
collapsed. Collapse equals 133. 8 June

1339
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:36,000
2000. Mount Etna smoke ring stunt

1340
00:53:33,839 --> 00:53:39,280
occurred on Kanye West's birthday. What

1341
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:42,280
a coincidence. Kanye West and Mount Etna

1342
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:45,280
have the exact same numerology.

1343
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:46,720
Checkmate geologists. I at this point I

1344
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:49,359
don't even know who we're checkmating.

1345
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:51,839
Conspiracism is preodern thought applied

1346
00:53:49,359 --> 00:53:54,000
to post-modern politics. Carl Pauper

1347
00:53:51,839 --> 00:53:55,839
said the conspiracy theory of society

1348
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:58,319
comes from abandoning God and then

1349
00:53:55,839 --> 00:54:00,400
asking who is in his place. Well,

1350
00:53:58,319 --> 00:54:03,040
apparently the globalists or the deep

1351
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:05,599
state or the Illuminati, the Freemasons,

1352
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:07,920
the Vatican, the World Economic Forum,

1353
00:54:05,599 --> 00:54:11,359
the Bilderberg Group, the Satanic Cabal,

1354
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:13,119
the you know, the New York, Hollywood,

1355
00:54:11,359 --> 00:54:15,599
International Banking, Rothschild,

1356
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:17,599
Soros, Communist, Zionists, you know the

1357
00:54:15,599 --> 00:54:20,400
ones. So, there is disagreement among

1358
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:22,319
conspiracists about who they are, about

1359
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:24,800
who controls the world, who is the

1360
00:54:22,319 --> 00:54:27,359
puppet master, but they all agree that

1361
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:29,280
someone is. It's a kind of intelligent

1362
00:54:27,359 --> 00:54:31,599
design theory of world events.

1363
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:33,839
Conspiracism is to politics, economics,

1364
00:54:31,599 --> 00:54:36,079
and apparently meteorology what

1365
00:54:33,839 --> 00:54:38,000
creationism is to biology. And it's

1366
00:54:36,079 --> 00:54:40,160
motivated by a lot of the same anxieties

1367
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:41,920
and misunderstandings. Like creationists

1368
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:44,079
will say, "Well, if God didn't create

1369
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:46,559
mankind in his own image, then I suppose

1370
00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:48,960
it's just a random accident that one day

1371
00:54:46,559 --> 00:54:50,400
monkeys gave birth to mima." Okay, but

1372
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:52,880
that's not what the theory of evolution

1373
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:55,040
says. Science [ __ ] Chuck's book is not

1374
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:57,760
titled On the Origin of Species by

1375
00:54:55,040 --> 00:55:00,000
Random Accident. Oopsy dupsy. New

1376
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:02,480
species originated. No, it's on the

1377
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:04,319
origin of species by natural selection.

1378
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:06,880
Natural selection is not random

1379
00:55:04,319 --> 00:55:08,559
accident. It's a long-term process where

1380
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:10,400
heritable characteristics better suited

1381
00:55:08,559 --> 00:55:12,400
to a part. Why am I bothering to explain

1382
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:14,559
this? Why am I even making this video?

1383
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:16,400
Why do anything at all? I guess for the

1384
00:55:14,559 --> 00:55:18,720
pleasure of rolling the boulder up the

1385
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:21,839
mountain once again, one must imagine

1386
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:23,760
Sisph is happy. Okay. Well, don't tell

1387
00:55:21,839 --> 00:55:25,760
me what to imagine. The point is

1388
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:27,760
evolution doesn't need a plan. I mean,

1389
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:31,839
you could argue that evolution is God's

1390
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:33,599
plan. And okay, seems like a weird plan,

1391
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:35,440
but it's not weirder than ordering

1392
00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:37,200
Abraham to sacrifice his kid and saying,

1393
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:39,359
"Just kidding." At the last moment, it

1394
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:42,319
was just a prank, bro. Father almost

1395
00:55:39,359 --> 00:55:45,200
sacrifices son. Prank gone wrong.

1396
00:55:42,319 --> 00:55:46,559
Hilarious. Liked and subscribed. Now,

1397
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:48,480
things get a little more complicated

1398
00:55:46,559 --> 00:55:50,480
with history and politics because

1399
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:52,880
obviously a lot of things that happen in

1400
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:54,720
politics are the result of someone's

1401
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:56,960
deliberate plan. Whether or not you

1402
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:58,960
believe in 9/11 conspiracy theories, I

1403
00:55:56,960 --> 00:56:01,680
think we all agree that someone decided

1404
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:03,599
to fly planes into those buildings or

1405
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:05,760
holograms or whatever it is you people

1406
00:56:03,599 --> 00:56:08,119
think happened. Russia invaded Ukraine

1407
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:11,200
presumably because Vlad Putin made a

1408
00:56:08,119 --> 00:56:13,520
plan. Not a good plan clearly, but

1409
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:15,280
technically some kind of plan. And the

1410
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:18,079
invasion of Ukraine is typical of the

1411
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:20,400
way actual plans tend to play out. One,

1412
00:56:18,079 --> 00:56:23,280
it's a plan of a single faction, not of

1413
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:25,599
some unitary global elite. And two, the

1414
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:27,920
plan is marked by human frailty. It's

1415
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:29,599
half-hazard. It's improvisational. It

1416
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:31,319
unfolds in ways the planners didn't

1417
00:56:29,599 --> 00:56:34,240
anticipate. This is not how

1418
00:56:31,319 --> 00:56:36,799
conspiracists understand plans. In his

1419
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:39,119
best-selling crackpot ravings, Behold a

1420
00:56:36,799 --> 00:56:40,960
Pale Horse, conspiracist William Cooper

1421
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:43,359
describes his intentionalist view of

1422
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:45,680
history. quote, "A grand game of chess

1423
00:56:43,359 --> 00:56:48,880
is being played on a level that we can

1424
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:50,880
barely imagine, and we are the pawns."

1425
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:52,799
He then absurdly suggests that before

1426
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:55,200
continuing the book, the reader should

1427
00:56:52,799 --> 00:56:58,000
play quote at least two complete games

1428
00:56:55,200 --> 00:57:00,880
of chess, you must learn the rules they

1429
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:03,040
play by. And yes, they is in all caps.

1430
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:05,599
Conspiracists are incapable of any other

1431
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:08,000
typographical style. Conspiracists think

1432
00:57:05,599 --> 00:57:10,319
that if political power seems divided

1433
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:12,160
and incompetent, that's just because we

1434
00:57:10,319 --> 00:57:14,400
are stuck in the dream world at the

1435
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:16,640
bottom of the pyramid, unaware of the

1436
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:18,799
evil chess demons secretly controlling

1437
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:21,520
everything. Listen to how 18th century

1438
00:57:18,799 --> 00:57:23,599
conspiracist Ogustan Barwell described

1439
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:25,599
the secret causes of the revolution.

1440
00:57:23,599 --> 00:57:26,880
Quote, "Even the most horrid deeds

1441
00:57:25,599 --> 00:57:29,280
perpetrated during the French

1442
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:31,040
Revolution, everything was foreseen and

1443
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:33,200
resolved on, was combined and

1444
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:35,119
premeditated. They were the offspring of

1445
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:37,280
deep thought villain since they had been

1446
00:57:35,119 --> 00:57:39,440
prepared and were produced by men who

1447
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:41,440
alone held the clue of those plots and

1448
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:43,359
conspiracies lurking in the secret

1449
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:45,200
meetings where they had been conceived.

1450
00:57:43,359 --> 00:57:46,960
This is not how things actually happened

1451
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:48,960
though, Augustan. An event like the

1452
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:50,880
French Revolution is too complicated to

1453
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:53,280
be the result of a perfectly executed

1454
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:55,359
master plan. But just like creationists,

1455
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:57,040
conspiracists often fail to even

1456
00:57:55,359 --> 00:57:59,200
understand the alternative to

1457
00:57:57,040 --> 00:58:01,440
intelligent design. Conspiracist Gary

1458
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:03,200
Allen writes, "There are really only two

1459
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:05,440
theories of history. Either things

1460
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:08,000
happen by accident and neither planned

1461
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:10,400
nor caused by anybody, or they happen

1462
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:12,799
because they are planned and somebody

1463
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:14,640
causes them to happen." This is a false

1464
00:58:12,799 --> 00:58:16,559
dichotomy. We don't have to choose

1465
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:18,960
between the conspiracist view of history

1466
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:21,119
as a masterful game of chess and the

1467
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:23,760
straw man alternative that everything

1468
00:58:21,119 --> 00:58:25,280
happens by accident for no reason.

1469
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:26,960
That's not what mainstream historians

1470
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:29,520
are saying. They don't think the French

1471
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:31,599
Revolution was an accident. They just

1472
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:33,440
think the causes are complex. From the

1473
00:58:31,599 --> 00:58:35,760
Enlightenment to inherent tensions of

1474
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:38,559
the estate system to harvest failures in

1475
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:40,640
the 1780s. And yes, obviously various

1476
00:58:38,559 --> 00:58:42,880
people involved in the revolution made

1477
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:45,040
plans, but none of those people were

1478
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:47,520
masterminds secretly controlling every

1479
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:49,839
twist and turn, which if you put on your

1480
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:51,760
Sherlock Holmes hat, you should probably

1481
00:58:49,839 --> 00:58:54,160
be able to deduce from the fact that

1482
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:56,960
most of them were guillotined. Masterful

1483
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:58,799
gambit citizen. Intentionalism

1484
00:58:56,960 --> 00:59:00,960
especially runs rampant in the way

1485
00:58:58,799 --> 00:59:02,680
people talk about the economy. A topic

1486
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:04,559
where most people are a little

1487
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:06,880
conspiracist. You know why did the price

1488
00:59:04,559 --> 00:59:08,400
of eggs go up? It must be because the

1489
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:10,799
president turned up the big red

1490
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:12,480
inflation dial on his desk. Not that the

1491
00:59:10,799 --> 00:59:14,079
president has no control over the

1492
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:16,079
economy. You know, he can appoint the

1493
00:59:14,079 --> 00:59:19,040
Federal Reserve chair. He can propose

1494
00:59:16,079 --> 00:59:20,559
taxes, tariffs, wars, that sort of

1495
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:22,640
thing. But a lot of times blaming the

1496
00:59:20,559 --> 00:59:24,640
president for the price of gas and eggs

1497
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:26,799
makes about as much sense as sacrificing

1498
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:28,799
the king because the river flooded. It

1499
00:59:26,799 --> 00:59:30,720
feels good to blame someone, but in

1500
00:59:28,799 --> 00:59:32,480
reality there's not a single person on

1501
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:34,400
this earth who can precisely predict,

1502
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:37,040
much less control the economy. And

1503
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:38,960
that's sort of creepy, right? Like the

1504
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:41,359
whole world revolves around money, but

1505
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:43,920
money is this weird abstraction you have

1506
00:59:41,359 --> 00:59:46,000
to do math to understand. Most people

1507
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:48,400
aren't up for that. So we talk about the

1508
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:51,040
economy like it's an angry volcano god.

1509
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:53,200
Conspiracists really love to literalize

1510
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:55,119
the invisible hand. William Cooper

1511
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:57,200
claims that for the secret elites, it is

1512
00:59:55,119 --> 00:59:59,440
as easy to predict and control the trend

1513
00:59:57,200 --> 01:00:01,680
of an economy as to predict and control

1514
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:03,920
the trajectory of a projectile. The

1515
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:06,799
economy has been transformed into a

1516
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:09,040
guided missile on target. So, who is

1517
01:00:06,799 --> 01:00:11,440
launching this missile? Whose hand is

1518
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:12,960
the invisible hand? Well, conspiracists

1519
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:15,040
usually say that it's the international

1520
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:17,280
banking cabal or the Rothschild

1521
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:19,280
controlled central banks or a bunch of

1522
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:21,520
other words that basically mean Jews.

1523
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:23,040
Again, more on that later. To actually

1524
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:25,839
understand the economy, you would have

1525
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:28,480
to use scientific systematic thinking,

1526
01:00:25,839 --> 01:00:30,720
not animistic, intentionalist conspiracy

1527
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:32,880
thinking. In a way, every systematic

1528
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:35,599
theorist from Milton Freriedman to Karl

1529
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:38,000
Marx is closer to being correct than

1530
01:00:35,599 --> 01:00:41,040
literally every conspiracy theorist. And

1531
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:43,520
yet, even the most systematic thinkers

1532
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:45,760
still rely on intentionalist metaphors

1533
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:47,440
to communicate their ideas. When Adam

1534
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:49,280
Smith wanted to describe how the

1535
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:50,880
preference for doing business at home

1536
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:53,280
leads merchants pursuing their

1537
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:55,040
self-interest to also unintentionally

1538
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:57,839
promote the good of their country, he

1539
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:59,839
said they're led by an invisible hand.

1540
01:00:57,839 --> 01:01:01,920
When Karl Marx wanted to describe the

1541
01:00:59,839 --> 01:01:04,960
extraction of surplus value from the

1542
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:07,440
working class, he said capital is dead

1543
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:09,680
labor that acts like a vampire. It comes

1544
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:11,760
to life when it drinks living labor. And

1545
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:14,400
the more living labor it drinks, the

1546
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:17,599
more it comes to life. An invisible hand

1547
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:19,839
that guides us. Vampires drinking blood.

1548
01:01:17,599 --> 01:01:22,720
These are anthropomorphic metaphors that

1549
01:01:19,839 --> 01:01:24,799
describe an unintentional pattern as if

1550
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:27,119
it were an intentional action. So why

1551
01:01:24,799 --> 01:01:29,440
use these metaphors? Well, because this

1552
01:01:27,119 --> 01:01:31,119
is how humans think. We make sense of

1553
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:33,200
the world by imagining it as a

1554
01:01:31,119 --> 01:01:34,880
reflection of ourselves. We see the

1555
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:36,880
earth as a mother and the sun as a

1556
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:39,920
father. We imagine an economy with

1557
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:42,240
hands, capital with fangs, and the

1558
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:45,200
universe itself with a mind like our own

1559
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:47,119
but greater, which we call God. I don't

1560
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:49,640
think it's stupid to think this way. I

1561
01:01:47,119 --> 01:01:51,520
just think it's human. Humans think

1562
01:01:49,640 --> 01:01:53,680
humanishly. So, some level of

1563
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:55,680
intentionalism is probably inevitable.

1564
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:57,520
We sort of can't help it. It's one

1565
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:59,520
reason why conspiracy explanations of

1566
01:01:57,520 --> 01:02:01,680
events are so appealing, and it's

1567
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:04,079
compounded by a few other motives.

1568
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:05,200
Motive one is the denial of chaos. I'm

1569
01:02:04,079 --> 01:02:07,040
sorry. I know we're like three

1570
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:08,880
subsections deep. Unlike better

1571
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:10,799
YouTubers, I have not succeeded at

1572
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:12,960
organizing this video into an internet

1573
01:02:10,799 --> 01:02:15,520
friendly numbered list. It's scary to

1574
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:17,200
become an adult and to realize that in

1575
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:18,880
fact, your parents don't know what

1576
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:20,640
they're doing and no one knows what

1577
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:22,319
they're doing. There really are no

1578
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:24,720
grown-ups. Not in the way you thought

1579
01:02:22,319 --> 01:02:26,640
when you were a kid. It's unnerving to

1580
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:28,799
think that no one is steering the ship.

1581
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:31,280
So even if the deep state puppeteers are

1582
01:02:28,799 --> 01:02:33,680
evil, it's maybe reassuring to think

1583
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:36,079
that at least someone somewhere is in

1584
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:37,760
control. Someone is daddy. You know,

1585
01:02:36,079 --> 01:02:40,000
it's like daddy arrived and he's taking

1586
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:42,240
his belt off. Motive two is the denial

1587
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:44,079
of collective action. Why would August

1588
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:46,079
Barwell want to think that the French

1589
01:02:44,079 --> 01:02:48,240
Revolution was an Illuminati master

1590
01:02:46,079 --> 01:02:50,799
plan? Well, because he was a Catholic

1591
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:52,640
monarchist. So it was ideologically more

1592
01:02:50,799 --> 01:02:55,119
convenient for him to think secret

1593
01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:57,440
societies planned the revolution than to

1594
01:02:55,119 --> 01:02:58,880
accept that it wasn't any sense of the

1595
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:01,760
people. It's like the American

1596
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:03,760
conservatives in the 1950s who could not

1597
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:05,839
imagine why anyone would choose to be a

1598
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:08,000
communist. So they assumed it must be

1599
01:03:05,839 --> 01:03:10,079
water fidation and manurion

1600
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:12,319
brainwashing. or like the conservatives

1601
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:15,440
today who see every progressive social

1602
01:03:12,319 --> 01:03:18,799
movement from LGBT rights to Antifa to

1603
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:21,039
Black Lives Matter as top-down plots

1604
01:03:18,799 --> 01:03:23,520
perpetrated by Soros funded crisis

1605
01:03:21,039 --> 01:03:26,319
actors on behalf of the global homo woke

1606
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:28,960
agenda. Motive three is proportionality

1607
01:03:26,319 --> 01:03:31,760
bias. The tendency to assume that major

1608
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:33,839
events must have major causes. The idea

1609
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:36,480
that a world historic disaster like the

1610
01:03:33,839 --> 01:03:39,200
CO 19 pandemic could be caused by

1611
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:41,440
something so trivial and accidental as a

1612
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:44,480
bat virus being transmitted to humans

1613
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:46,880
via pengalins or whatever. It feels

1614
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:48,720
narratively imbalanced. It's more

1615
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:51,520
satisfying to imagine that it all

1616
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:54,000
unfolded according to a master plan of a

1617
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:57,280
secret global conspiracy to control the

1618
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:59,119
human race with face masks and arrows on

1619
01:03:57,280 --> 01:04:01,760
the floor of the grocery store. Wake up,

1620
01:03:59,119 --> 01:04:04,319
sheeple. Motive four is the need for

1621
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:07,039
someone to blame. This, I think, is the

1622
01:04:04,319 --> 01:04:09,440
big one. Whose fault is it is a very

1623
01:04:07,039 --> 01:04:11,599
important human question. The elites are

1624
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:14,160
the reason I get no women. I know this

1625
01:04:11,599 --> 01:04:16,799
may sound crazy, but retaliation is an

1626
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:18,559
instinctive reaction to injury. When

1627
01:04:16,799 --> 01:04:20,559
something goes wrong, we look for

1628
01:04:18,559 --> 01:04:23,200
someone to punish, even if it's not

1629
01:04:20,559 --> 01:04:25,359
really anyone's fault. When a storm

1630
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:28,000
destroyed his bridge, the Persian king

1631
01:04:25,359 --> 01:04:30,880
Xerxes supposedly ordered his men to

1632
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:33,200
whip the sea as punishment according to

1633
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:35,200
Herodotus. So probably that didn't

1634
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:36,799
happen. You can't trust what a Greek

1635
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:38,880
says about Persians. I'm always saying

1636
01:04:36,799 --> 01:04:40,559
that. But there's also real examples.

1637
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:42,559
During the Black Death, Jews were

1638
01:04:40,559 --> 01:04:44,799
falsely blamed for poisoning wells and

1639
01:04:42,559 --> 01:04:47,599
were massacred in pograms across Europe.

1640
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:50,079
In 2020, Trump called COVID the China

1641
01:04:47,599 --> 01:04:52,079
virus, using a similar kind of scapegoat

1642
01:04:50,079 --> 01:04:54,000
logic to direct populist rage at

1643
01:04:52,079 --> 01:04:56,640
foreigners, which is the entire thing he

1644
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:58,880
does. It's all he does. At the height of

1645
01:04:56,640 --> 01:05:01,280
the pandemic, millions of people viewed

1646
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:03,200
the Plemic trilogy of conspiracy

1647
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:05,200
documentaries, which falsely claimed the

1648
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:07,200
virus was deliberately engineered as

1649
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:09,839
part of a global conspiracy to take our

1650
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:11,839
freedoms. Pandemic provided scapegoats

1651
01:05:09,839 --> 01:05:13,839
by making cartoonish villains out of

1652
01:05:11,839 --> 01:05:18,559
everyone from Anthony Fouchy to Bill

1653
01:05:13,839 --> 01:05:20,240
Gates to the WH, WF, CDC, CCP, John D.

1654
01:05:18,559 --> 01:05:22,480
Rockefeller, big pharma, global

1655
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:24,480
communist agenda. And it's not that no

1656
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:26,480
one deserves any blame for the way the

1657
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:28,480
pandemic was handled. The 10 richest men

1658
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:30,240
in the world doubled their wealth in the

1659
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:32,319
same two years that millions of people

1660
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:34,559
slid into poverty. I think that's worth

1661
01:05:32,319 --> 01:05:37,359
being angry about. that the conspiracist

1662
01:05:34,559 --> 01:05:39,520
tendency is not to blame opportunists

1663
01:05:37,359 --> 01:05:41,520
taking advantage of unjust systems and

1664
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:43,359
perverse incentives. And it's certainly

1665
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:46,160
not to blame the systems and incentives

1666
01:05:43,359 --> 01:05:48,880
themselves. No, conspiracists demand

1667
01:05:46,160 --> 01:05:51,440
blood. So they seek out secret covens of

1668
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:53,440
witches and reptiles and Satanists whom

1669
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:57,039
they imagine are motivated by pure

1670
01:05:53,440 --> 01:06:02,000
ontological evil. Speaking of which,

1671
01:05:57,039 --> 01:06:05,039
conspiracist principle two, dualism.

1672
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:07,760
Dualism is the idea that society and

1673
01:06:05,039 --> 01:06:10,240
maybe even reality itself is a struggle

1674
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:12,799
of good against evil, light against

1675
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:14,680
dark. There's a battle being fought over

1676
01:06:12,799 --> 01:06:17,520
our heads for world

1677
01:06:14,680 --> 01:06:21,280
dominance. A battle between good and

1678
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:23,230
evil. Either you are with us or you are

1679
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:23,860
with the terrorists.

1680
01:06:23,230 --> 01:06:25,920
[Applause]

1681
01:06:23,860 --> 01:06:27,920
[Music]

1682
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:29,599
I'll quote another Marjory tweet cuz she

1683
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:31,680
thinks with the same subtlety that she

1684
01:06:29,599 --> 01:06:34,240
does pull-ups. quote, "We are in a

1685
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:36,480
battle between good and evil. The

1686
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:38,880
Democrats are the party of pedophiles,

1687
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:41,760
murdering the innocent unborn, etc.,

1688
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:43,680
etc. The Democrat party is flatout evil,

1689
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:45,760
and yesterday they tried to murder

1690
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:47,559
President Trump." Imagine the Democrats

1691
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:49,760
attempting something as proactive as an

1692
01:06:47,559 --> 01:06:52,000
assassination. Not really their MMO, is

1693
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:54,319
it? Dualism is a view of human behavior

1694
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:56,640
devoid of moral ambiguity where people

1695
01:06:54,319 --> 01:06:59,039
do bad things not because of ignorance

1696
01:06:56,640 --> 01:07:01,119
or a misbegotten sense of righteousness,

1697
01:06:59,039 --> 01:07:03,599
but because they have consciously sworn

1698
01:07:01,119 --> 01:07:05,359
allegiance to the forces of evil. And it

1699
01:07:03,599 --> 01:07:07,520
must be a great confidence boost to

1700
01:07:05,359 --> 01:07:09,359
people who think this way to know that

1701
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:11,200
because they haven't sworn allegiance to

1702
01:07:09,359 --> 01:07:13,200
evil, they must be on the side of

1703
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:16,079
righteousness in everything they do.

1704
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:17,920
Sometimes people call this man thinking

1705
01:07:16,079 --> 01:07:20,160
in reference to the religion founded by

1706
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:22,480
the ancient prophet Mani who taught that

1707
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:24,640
there is not one god but two opposing

1708
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:26,640
powers. The father of greatness versus

1709
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:29,520
the prince of darkness. But I feel like

1710
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:32,720
calling it manon evades the fact that

1711
01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:35,039
most people who think this way are well

1712
01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:36,960
followers of more popular religions. So

1713
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:40,079
I'm calling it dualism. Now I'll just

1714
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:42,240
say it. Dualism is wrong. The world is

1715
01:07:40,079 --> 01:07:44,200
not a battle between light and dark.

1716
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:46,319
Light and dark are complimentary and

1717
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:48,000
codependent. And I know that's true

1718
01:07:46,319 --> 01:07:50,319
because it was revealed to me by the

1719
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:52,799
Archangel Medatron in a mystical vision

1720
01:07:50,319 --> 01:07:54,559
I had after consuming some sacred plant

1721
01:07:52,799 --> 01:07:57,200
medicine from the mother earth.

1722
01:07:54,559 --> 01:07:59,440
Checkmate, Manakans. Sometimes the best

1723
01:07:57,200 --> 01:08:01,680
way to test an idea is to look at the

1724
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:03,680
other things it leads people to believe.

1725
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:06,640
So let's look at some dualist thinking

1726
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:08,799
in action. In May 2024, Buckingham

1727
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:10,880
Palace unveiled Jonathan Yo's portrait

1728
01:08:08,799 --> 01:08:13,359
of King Charles III, which depicts the

1729
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:16,640
monarch against a red background evoking

1730
01:08:13,359 --> 01:08:19,520
like a sea of blood and fire. Normal

1731
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:21,920
people agreed that this was funny, but

1732
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:24,000
conspiracists flushed to social media to

1733
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:26,000
speculate that Kate Middleton was dead

1734
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:28,080
and the portrait was painted with her

1735
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:30,239
blood and that vertically mirroring the

1736
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:33,440
painting along its right edge reveals

1737
01:08:30,239 --> 01:08:36,080
the face of Satan, prince of darkness.

1738
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:39,600
Conspiracist Naomi Wolf quote, "These

1739
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:40,880
Satanists just don't sleep. My god, it

1740
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:42,640
was really bad for your skin to not

1741
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:44,640
sleep. That's probably why they need the

1742
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:46,960
adrenochrome." So, look, I agree that

1743
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:49,040
the king is bad. We're on the same page

1744
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:50,960
there. But he's not bad because he's a

1745
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:53,440
secret Satan worshipper who hides

1746
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:55,600
demonic images and oil paintings. No,

1747
01:08:53,440 --> 01:08:58,560
the king is bad because, prepare

1748
01:08:55,600 --> 01:09:00,960
yourself, Brits, yank take incoming.

1749
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:03,040
Because monarchy is bad. But

1750
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:05,359
conspiracists do not understand that

1751
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:07,440
problems can arise from a form of

1752
01:09:05,359 --> 01:09:09,279
government itself. For conspiracists,

1753
01:09:07,440 --> 01:09:11,040
the problem is never the structure of

1754
01:09:09,279 --> 01:09:14,000
power, but rather that the people

1755
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:16,719
currently in power just so happen to be

1756
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:19,679
evil Satanists. Listen to how QAnon

1757
01:09:16,719 --> 01:09:22,640
propaganda film Q the plan to save the

1758
01:09:19,679 --> 01:09:25,440
world directed by Joe M describes the

1759
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:27,199
root of all societal problems. We were

1760
01:09:25,440 --> 01:09:28,960
taught that capitalism was the cause of

1761
01:09:27,199 --> 01:09:30,960
a massive rich poor divide and the

1762
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:33,359
reason for poverty. Others were taught

1763
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:35,679
that communism, the system of equal

1764
01:09:33,359 --> 01:09:37,920
wealth across all people, was really to

1765
01:09:35,679 --> 01:09:40,239
blame for the mess. But you see, folks,

1766
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:42,159
it is none of these things. What you

1767
01:09:40,239 --> 01:09:44,159
must learn is that it was the criminals

1768
01:09:42,159 --> 01:09:46,799
all along. What you must learn is that

1769
01:09:44,159 --> 01:09:49,359
it has always been them, a colossal

1770
01:09:46,799 --> 01:09:51,920
global criminal class. Joe M argues that

1771
01:09:49,359 --> 01:09:53,679
inequality, crime, and war are not the

1772
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:56,320
result of any particular political

1773
01:09:53,679 --> 01:09:58,400
order, but are the result of satanic

1774
01:09:56,320 --> 01:10:00,640
criminals taking over government,

1775
01:09:58,400 --> 01:10:03,199
industry, media, and banking, and

1776
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:05,280
deliberately oppressing us, the good

1777
01:10:03,199 --> 01:10:07,440
people, by attacking the family,

1778
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:10,239
poisoning our food, and murdering our

1779
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:12,800
beautiful dead wife, JFK. Rest in peace,

1780
01:10:10,239 --> 01:10:14,960
sweet angel. The world is currently

1781
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:17,440
experiencing a dramatic covert war of

1782
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:19,840
biblical proportions. Literally the

1783
01:10:17,440 --> 01:10:22,560
fight for Earth between the forces of

1784
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:25,040
good and evil. The apocalyptic tone

1785
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:27,360
conceals a kind of optimism. If we could

1786
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:29,440
just purge the deep state, then all the

1787
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:31,600
world's problems would be solved. No

1788
01:10:29,440 --> 01:10:33,679
more war, no more poverty, no more

1789
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:36,159
crime, because all of that is the

1790
01:10:33,679 --> 01:10:38,880
deliberate plan of the ontologically

1791
01:10:36,159 --> 01:10:41,360
evil cabal and their mainstream media

1792
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:43,840
shills. We realized that the problem was

1793
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:46,800
never capitalism or socialism, Democrat

1794
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:48,880
or Republican, black or white, Muslim or

1795
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:50,719
Christian. We know it was just very

1796
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:52,400
powerful criminals who had too much

1797
01:10:50,719 --> 01:10:55,120
power. It can be tempting to think that

1798
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:57,199
conspiracists are confused socialists

1799
01:10:55,120 --> 01:10:59,679
since they're seemingly so bothered by

1800
01:10:57,199 --> 01:11:01,440
rich elites. But they're not socialists.

1801
01:10:59,679 --> 01:11:03,440
They think both capitalists and

1802
01:11:01,440 --> 01:11:06,080
socialists are bad because they're all

1803
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:08,400
puppets of the real satanic power behind

1804
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:11,360
the throne. Some conspiracy theories

1805
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:13,679
like QAnon are very explicit that the

1806
01:11:11,360 --> 01:11:16,159
enemy is literally Satan. But

1807
01:11:13,679 --> 01:11:18,640
conspiracist dualism can also be a

1808
01:11:16,159 --> 01:11:21,280
little more subtle than the least subtle

1809
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:23,360
it is possible to be. John Burcher style

1810
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:25,600
anti-communist conspiracy theories of

1811
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:27,600
the last century usually didn't mention

1812
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:30,239
Satan specifically, but the way they

1813
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:32,560
told it, communism may as well have been

1814
01:11:30,239 --> 01:11:35,040
the devil. When conspiracists like Alex

1815
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:37,120
Jones or his major influence Gary Allen

1816
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:39,520
rant about communism, they're not

1817
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:41,600
talking about actual communist theory or

1818
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:43,760
practice. Like, here's how Gary Allen

1819
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:46,320
defines communism. And yes, the

1820
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:48,400
definition is in all caps. Quote, "An

1821
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:50,080
international conspiratorial drive for

1822
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:51,760
power on the part of men in high places

1823
01:11:50,080 --> 01:11:54,719
willing to use any means to bring about

1824
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:56,480
their desired aim, global conquest." He

1825
01:11:54,719 --> 01:11:59,600
argues that Karl Marx was merely a

1826
01:11:56,480 --> 01:12:02,080
pathy, a pamphlete and hired goon of the

1827
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:04,239
Illuminati communist bankers. That no

1828
01:12:02,080 --> 01:12:06,480
one in power ever sincerely believed

1829
01:12:04,239 --> 01:12:09,040
that communism is good because he

1830
01:12:06,480 --> 01:12:12,000
defines communism as a plan to

1831
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:14,480
consciously do evil. Quote, "The issue

1832
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:17,040
very simply is the enslavement of you

1833
01:12:14,480 --> 01:12:19,840
and your children." The idea of satanic

1834
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:22,239
elites was taken to its extreme by new

1835
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:24,640
age conspiracist David Ike, who

1836
01:12:22,239 --> 01:12:26,480
popularized the theory that the secret

1837
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:29,080
rulers of the world are literally

1838
01:12:26,480 --> 01:12:31,840
inhuman. That they're shape-shifting,

1839
01:12:29,080 --> 01:12:33,920
bloodrinking extraterrestrial reptiles

1840
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:36,000
who are using a metaphysical construct

1841
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:38,159
called the Saturn Moon Matrix to

1842
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:39,320
imprison humanity in a simulation with

1843
01:12:38,159 --> 01:12:42,239
bad

1844
01:12:39,320 --> 01:12:44,400
vibes. Maybe ease up on the red pills

1845
01:12:42,239 --> 01:12:47,040
there, buddy. I think you've had enough.

1846
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:49,440
We need red pill narcans. We're losing

1847
01:12:47,040 --> 01:12:52,080
him. To illustrate why dualism is wrong,

1848
01:12:49,440 --> 01:12:54,960
let's use MK Ultra as an example. Why

1849
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:57,120
did MK Ultra happen? Did the CIA

1850
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:59,480
experiment with mind control because

1851
01:12:57,120 --> 01:13:02,880
they were Satanists who delight in doing

1852
01:12:59,480 --> 01:13:05,120
evil? No, that's not how things happen.

1853
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:07,840
In all of human history, almost nothing

1854
01:13:05,120 --> 01:13:09,920
has happened because of Satanists. The

1855
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:12,560
CIA wanted to develop mind control

1856
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:15,199
because they were good American patriots

1857
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:17,600
with a paranoid conspiratorial streak of

1858
01:13:15,199 --> 01:13:20,000
their own. They saw videos of American

1859
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:22,320
prisoners of war in Korea declaring

1860
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:23,840
allegiance to communism. And instead of

1861
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:26,239
concluding that this was the result of

1862
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:28,800
torture or genuine disillusionment with

1863
01:13:26,239 --> 01:13:31,199
what America was doing in Korea, the CIA

1864
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:34,000
feared that the communists had developed

1865
01:13:31,199 --> 01:13:36,400
mind control and they would not allow a

1866
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:38,320
mind control gap. So they didn't think

1867
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:41,280
they were doing evil. They thought of

1868
01:13:38,320 --> 01:13:43,679
themselves as protecting the free world

1869
01:13:41,280 --> 01:13:45,920
against an existential threat. And when

1870
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:48,239
those are the stakes, the ends justify

1871
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:50,159
the means. And that is how you end up

1872
01:13:48,239 --> 01:13:52,199
seated in front of a one-way mirror

1873
01:13:50,159 --> 01:13:55,040
watching prostitutes poison people with

1874
01:13:52,199 --> 01:13:57,280
LSD. If you're a fed, I just do it for

1875
01:13:55,040 --> 01:13:59,920
fun. This is not to deny there was an

1876
01:13:57,280 --> 01:14:01,760
element of sadism involved in MK Ultra.

1877
01:13:59,920 --> 01:14:04,000
In fact, I'm sure there was. This man

1878
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:06,159
worked on some of these programs. He

1879
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:09,280
would write of his work, "It was fun,

1880
01:14:06,159 --> 01:14:11,280
fun, fun." From brothel, an agent says,

1881
01:14:09,280 --> 01:14:14,159
"We learned a lot about human nature in

1882
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:16,880
the bedroom." But sadism usually finds a

1883
01:14:14,159 --> 01:14:18,320
justification for itself. Conspiracists

1884
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:20,080
have never heard the saying that the

1885
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:22,080
road to hell is paved with good

1886
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:24,520
intentions. The final element of

1887
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:26,800
conspiracist dualism is what's called

1888
01:14:24,520 --> 01:14:28,560
millinarianism. The idea that the battle

1889
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:31,280
between good and evil is reaching an

1890
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:34,080
imminent climax resulting in a messianic

1891
01:14:31,280 --> 01:14:37,040
age. Raging around us is the final phase

1892
01:14:34,080 --> 01:14:39,280
of a vast global shadow war. Not between

1893
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:41,760
nations, but between the forces of good

1894
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:44,159
and the most unimaginable of evils. For

1895
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:46,320
KQanon, the day of judgment was the

1896
01:14:44,159 --> 01:14:48,719
storm. And it's not an exaggeration to

1897
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:51,840
say that many viewed and at time of

1898
01:14:48,719 --> 01:14:54,880
filming still view Trump as the messiah.

1899
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:57,199
I have grown to fully trust Dawn, master

1900
01:14:54,880 --> 01:15:00,080
of all masters. Conspiracists of every

1901
01:14:57,199 --> 01:15:02,560
era usually believe that total ruin or

1902
01:15:00,080 --> 01:15:04,480
total transformation is at hand. The

1903
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:06,800
survival of the free world depends on

1904
01:15:04,480 --> 01:15:09,199
the sheeple waking up. The truth will

1905
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:12,000
shake the earth to its foundations. Alex

1906
01:15:09,199 --> 01:15:14,400
Jones has been saying for 25 years that

1907
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:17,040
tyranny is imminent. One world

1908
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:20,640
government, nuclear apocalypse, World

1909
01:15:17,040 --> 01:15:23,520
War II, civil war alert. The globalists

1910
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:26,400
are always just about to make that final

1911
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:29,199
move. any day now. It's why you need to

1912
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:31,360
stay tuned in to Infowars for tomorrow's

1913
01:15:29,199 --> 01:15:34,239
news today. And while you're here,

1914

please buy our super male vitality serum

and help us pay our defamation damages.

1917
01:15:40,080 --> 01:15:44,960
But researchers say some of Jones's

1918
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:48,180
supplements could be sperm killing.

1919
01:15:44,960 --> 01:15:49,840
Conspiracist principle three, symbolism.

1920
01:15:48,180 --> 01:15:51,760
[Music]

1921
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:53,679
So to show you what I mean by symbolism,

1922
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:56,480
I'm just going to list some things I

1923
01:15:53,679 --> 01:15:59,440
have seen cited as evidence of a global

1924
01:15:56,480 --> 01:16:01,600
satanic conspiracy. Corporate logos that

1925
01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:04,000
look like the planet Saturn, the monster

1926
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:06,560
energy drink symbol, the statue of Shiva

1927
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:09,520
at CERN, subliminal sexual imagery in

1928
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:12,000
Disney movies, red shoes, celebrities

1929
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:15,360
holding pizza boxes, celebrities making

1930
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:18,080
hand signs, hidden in plain sight, Tom

1931
01:16:15,360 --> 01:16:20,159
Hanks saluting the Baffomet and Forest

1932
01:16:18,080 --> 01:16:22,320
Gump. Sir, I would like to introduce you

1933
01:16:20,159 --> 01:16:24,719
to the Congressional Medal of Honor. US

1934
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:28,480
Congressional Medal of Honor, killing

1935
01:16:24,719 --> 01:16:32,159
for Lucifer. Tom Ax is another Satanist

1936
01:16:28,480 --> 01:16:34,560
and Pedo and of course the godamn

1937
01:16:32,159 --> 01:16:37,120
reptiles. Isn't it weird that the

1938
01:16:34,560 --> 01:16:39,760
Vatican's audience hall is full of

1939
01:16:37,120 --> 01:16:42,480
references to reptilians? If Satanists

1940
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:44,440
took over the Vatican, would you notice?

1941
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:47,199
Therefore, they openly showcase their

1942
01:16:44,440 --> 01:16:48,719
symbolism. Therefore, they were sloppy.

1943
01:16:47,199 --> 01:16:50,880
If you fold a dollar bill the right way

1944
01:16:48,719 --> 01:16:53,199
and place it side by side, it reveals a

1945
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:56,000
reptilian face with sharp teeth. And

1946
01:16:53,199 --> 01:16:57,679
beneath those teeth, Satan. There's a

1947
01:16:56,000 --> 01:17:00,400
whole genre of conspiracy theories based

1948
01:16:57,679 --> 01:17:01,840
on symbolism in US currency. The Eye of

1949
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:04,159
Providence, and the dollar bill is the

1950
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:06,480
most famous, but the Kansas hole goes

1951
01:17:04,159 --> 01:17:08,800
deeper than that. $5 bill shows the Twin

1952
01:17:06,480 --> 01:17:11,120
Towers. $10 bill shows after the planes

1953
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:13,280
collided. $20 bill shows the buildings

1954
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:15,760
collapsing. $50 bill shows the dust and

1955
01:17:13,280 --> 01:17:18,239
the smoke. $100 bill shows a new

1956
01:17:15,760 --> 01:17:20,400
beginning. The money is all shaped like

1957
01:17:18,239 --> 01:17:22,480
an airplane. Yes. All money is shaped

1958
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:24,360
like an airplane if you fold it in the

1959
01:17:22,480 --> 01:17:27,280
shape of an airplane. What a

1960
01:17:24,360 --> 01:17:30,280
coincidence. Move along. Nothing to see

1961
01:17:27,280 --> 01:17:30,280
here.

1962
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:36,400
You don't want my dollar back. Is this

1963
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:39,040
what they mean by follow the money?

1964
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:41,280
Okay. So, corporate logos, hand signs in

1965
01:17:39,040 --> 01:17:44,560
music videos, images in Hollywood

1966
01:17:41,280 --> 01:17:46,880
movies, occult symbols on currency. What

1967
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:49,600
kind of evidence is this? is a style of

1968
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:52,159
conspiracism made explicit by one of Q's

1969
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:54,320
recurring slogans. Symbolism will be

1970
01:17:52,159 --> 01:17:56,480
their downfall. The idea is you can

1971
01:17:54,320 --> 01:17:58,560
define the existence and nature of a

1972
01:17:56,480 --> 01:18:01,199
conspiracy by learning to read the

1973
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:03,440
symbolic language of the elite. QAnon

1974
01:18:01,199 --> 01:18:06,480
formalized this decoding activity

1975
01:18:03,440 --> 01:18:09,120
through Q drops or breadcrumbs, cryptic

1976
01:18:06,480 --> 01:18:12,640
messages that followers had to bake or

1977
01:18:09,120 --> 01:18:15,280
decipher. Like an army of digital ais,

1978
01:18:12,640 --> 01:18:17,360
we connect the dots. It's a gamification

1979
01:18:15,280 --> 01:18:19,840
of political speculation that's been

1980
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:22,719
compared to an ARG. It's exciting to

1981
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:25,199
discover secrets, uncover plots, solve

1982
01:18:22,719 --> 01:18:27,760
puzzles, decrypt codes, connect the

1983
01:18:25,199 --> 01:18:29,000
dots, divine the future. It's a

1984
01:18:27,760 --> 01:18:30,960
discourse that's not even

1985
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:32,960
pseudointellectual because it's not even

1986
01:18:30,960 --> 01:18:35,199
trying to appear rational. It's most

1987
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:37,679
closely related to occult divinatory

1988
01:18:35,199 --> 01:18:40,640
practices like astrology or tarot

1989
01:18:37,679 --> 01:18:42,640
reading. I call it mediammancy. If

1990
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:45,520
cardamomcy is divination by reading

1991
01:18:42,640 --> 01:18:47,199
cards and necromancy is divination by

1992
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:49,520
talking to dead people, then

1993
01:18:47,199 --> 01:18:52,000
mediiammancy is divination by

1994
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:54,159
interpreting satanic Illuminati symbols

1995
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:56,480
and Taylor Swift music videos.

1996
01:18:54,159 --> 01:18:58,480
Conspiracist symbolism views the media,

1997
01:18:56,480 --> 01:19:00,560
the iconography of government, industry,

1998
01:18:58,480 --> 01:19:03,040
and religion. Even the events of history

1999
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:04,719
itself, as so many tea leaves in which

2000
01:19:03,040 --> 01:19:07,040
you can divine the true nature of

2001
01:19:04,719 --> 01:19:09,199
reality and predict the wicked schemes

2002
01:19:07,040 --> 01:19:11,199
of the elite. Oh my god, the Statue of

2003
01:19:09,199 --> 01:19:12,920
Liberty is actually Lucifer. Oh my god,

2004
01:19:11,199 --> 01:19:14,440
the One World Trade Center looks like a

2005
01:19:12,920 --> 01:19:16,800
syringe.

2006
01:19:14,440 --> 01:19:18,800
Vaxed. Conspiracists usually believe

2007
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:20,480
that the news is fake, that every

2008
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:23,440
official source of information is

2009
01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:25,920
propaganda for the cabal, and yet it's

2010
01:19:23,440 --> 01:19:27,840
also full of cryptic hints and symbols

2011
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:30,560
which we can decode and piece together

2012
01:19:27,840 --> 01:19:32,719
to reveal the hidden truth. Now, a

2013
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:34,960
rational person might ask, what do the

2014
01:19:32,719 --> 01:19:36,800
elites gain by this? Why would they

2015
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:40,159
place these symbols everywhere for us to

2016
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:42,960
find? Well, to mock us. They're doing it

2017
01:19:40,159 --> 01:19:45,199
out in the open. Normalizing Satanism is

2018
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:47,040
a stage, a milestone on the road to the

2019
01:19:45,199 --> 01:19:49,520
new world order. It is a method of

2020
01:19:47,040 --> 01:19:52,080
satanic inversion, of turning white into

2021
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:53,760
black and good into evil. A casual

2022
01:19:52,080 --> 01:19:55,840
reminder that Taylor Swift is literally

2023
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:58,480
normalizing Satanism. So, the idea is

2024
01:19:55,840 --> 01:20:00,880
that the elites are evil occultists, so

2025
01:19:58,480 --> 01:20:03,440
they put evil occult symbols everywhere

2026
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:04,719
because that's what evil occultists do.

2027
01:20:03,440 --> 01:20:06,640
I don't think treating this like a

2028
01:20:04,719 --> 01:20:09,040
rational argument will get us anywhere.

2029
01:20:06,640 --> 01:20:11,840
So, let's instead try to make sense of

2030
01:20:09,040 --> 01:20:13,600
it by comparison with astrology. Now, I

2031
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:16,239
need to clarify my view of astrology

2032
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:18,159
because by comparing it to conspiracism,

2033
01:20:16,239 --> 01:20:19,920
it might sound like I have a negative

2034
01:20:18,159 --> 01:20:21,840
opinion of astrology. So, I need to

2035
01:20:19,920 --> 01:20:25,120
tread carefully here or I'll be forever

2036
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:27,920
exiled from the LGBT community. More so,

2037
01:20:25,120 --> 01:20:30,640
I think astrology has its place so long

2038
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:32,719
as astrology knows its place. And the

2039
01:20:30,640 --> 01:20:35,120
essential guide to practical astrology,

2040
01:20:32,719 --> 01:20:37,360
April Elliot Kent writes, "Astrology is

2041
01:20:35,120 --> 01:20:40,120
a language. It's the sky's way of

2042
01:20:37,360 --> 01:20:42,400
speaking to us. Taken literally, this is

2043
01:20:40,120 --> 01:20:44,480
intentionalism. The sky does not speak

2044
01:20:42,400 --> 01:20:46,400
any more than volcanoes get angry. But

2045
01:20:44,480 --> 01:20:48,640
taken metaphorically, it could be true

2046
01:20:46,400 --> 01:20:50,640
that contemplating planetary cycles

2047
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:53,760
causes me to realize something about my

2048
01:20:50,640 --> 01:20:56,080
own emotions. Like for example, that I

2049
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:58,960
have bipolar disorder. If that wasn't

2050
01:20:56,080 --> 01:21:00,560
obvious from, you know, look around us.

2051
01:20:58,960 --> 01:21:02,560
In my opinion, when astrologers are

2052
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:04,560
asked to explain themselves, they should

2053
01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:06,400
say something like this. Astrology is a

2054
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:08,560
centuries old tradition of storytelling

2055
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:10,640
that uses a symbolic language based

2056
01:21:08,560 --> 01:21:12,800
around the movement of the planets to

2057
01:21:10,640 --> 01:21:15,440
provide meaning and guidance to people's

2058
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:17,600
lives. All human thinking is to some

2059
01:21:15,440 --> 01:21:19,920
extent projection. Like what is a

2060
01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:21,920
constellation? It's connecting the dots

2061
01:21:19,920 --> 01:21:24,080
in the most literal sense. The

2062
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:26,480
constellation Aries is a ram. But is the

2063
01:21:24,080 --> 01:21:28,400
ram in the sky or is the ram in our

2064
01:21:26,480 --> 01:21:30,800
minds? It doesn't even really look like

2065
01:21:28,400 --> 01:21:32,719
a ram to me. But it wasn't named by me.

2066
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:35,120
was named by ancient people who spent a

2067
01:21:32,719 --> 01:21:37,080
lot more time around sheep. Human brains

2068
01:21:35,120 --> 01:21:39,360
search for patterns. It's called

2069
01:21:37,080 --> 01:21:41,360
apeenia, the tendency to perceive

2070
01:21:39,360 --> 01:21:43,360
meaningful connections between unrelated

2071
01:21:41,360 --> 01:21:45,120
things. It's why we look at clouds and

2072
01:21:43,360 --> 01:21:47,280
see animals. It's why we look at

2073
01:21:45,120 --> 01:21:49,960
Disney's The Little Mermaid and see the

2074
01:21:47,280 --> 01:21:53,920
fallace of the father. I set certain

2075
01:21:49,960 --> 01:21:55,840
rules and I expect those rules to be

2076
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:57,920
obeyed. And when dad gets home, you know

2077
01:21:55,840 --> 01:22:00,320
what he says?

2078
01:21:57,920 --> 01:22:01,920
You've been a bad girl.

2079
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:04,239
You've been a bad little girl and you're

2080
01:22:01,920 --> 01:22:06,000
getting a vigorous spanking right now.

2081
01:22:04,239 --> 01:22:08,400
It's daddy, you [ __ ] Where's my

2082
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:10,159
bourbon? Our brains default to apophenia

2083
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:12,239
whenever we have no better methods of

2084
01:22:10,159 --> 01:22:14,320
analysis. You see this a lot on low

2085
01:22:12,239 --> 01:22:16,960
information investing forums like Wall

2086
01:22:14,320 --> 01:22:19,760
Street Bets. Low information investing.

2087
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:22,080
So gambling on gambling forums, gaps in

2088
01:22:19,760 --> 01:22:24,639
financial literacy are spontaneously

2089
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:27,040
filled by stone age superstition. The

2090
01:22:24,639 --> 01:22:29,280
Nvidia line made a shape and then go up.

2091
01:22:27,040 --> 01:22:31,760
The Tesla line made a similar shape.

2092
01:22:29,280 --> 01:22:34,000
Maybe it'd go up. Guys, at this point,

2093
01:22:31,760 --> 01:22:36,960
just consult the entrails of beasts like

2094
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:40,000
honest barbarians. Stockobsessed Gen Z

2095
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:43,120
are using astrology and tarot to invest.

2096
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:45,520
My god, the S&P 500 is in retrograde.

2097
01:22:43,120 --> 01:22:46,880
Well, by the retrograde, not only do we

2098
01:22:45,520 --> 01:22:49,760
recognize patterns where there aren't

2099
01:22:46,880 --> 01:22:51,679
any, but also our preconceived biases

2100
01:22:49,760 --> 01:22:53,440
influence the type of patterns that we

2101
01:22:51,679 --> 01:22:55,520
recognize. It's like people who go

2102
01:22:53,440 --> 01:22:57,440
looking for God tend to find the God

2103
01:22:55,520 --> 01:22:58,880
they're looking for. The Virgin Mary

2104
01:22:57,440 --> 01:23:00,800
tends to appear on grilled cheese

2105
01:22:58,880 --> 01:23:03,040
sandwiches in Miami, while the name of

2106
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:05,440
Allah tends to appear on melons in

2107
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:07,760
Indonesia. And conspiracists who think

2108
01:23:05,440 --> 01:23:10,080
the world is ruled by a satanic cabal

2109
01:23:07,760 --> 01:23:12,080
tend to find demonic symbols basically

2110
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:13,360
everywhere. Sam Smith and the weekend

2111
01:23:12,080 --> 01:23:15,600
with some of the most satanic

2112
01:23:13,360 --> 01:23:17,199
performances ever. With a literal six on

2113
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:18,960
her head, Daic and all these other

2114
01:23:17,199 --> 01:23:21,040
artists. Do you guys get it yet? An

2115
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:23,760
especially powerful type of epiphania is

2116
01:23:21,040 --> 01:23:26,400
called face paridolia. the tendency to

2117
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:28,639
see faces in inanimate objects. Almost

2118
01:23:26,400 --> 01:23:31,520
any symmetrical object with two dots

2119
01:23:28,639 --> 01:23:33,760
over a line we perceive as a face. It's

2120
01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:35,679
why emojis and emoticons can convert

2121
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:37,440
facial expressions with such little

2122
01:23:35,679 --> 01:23:39,520
information. And a guaranteed way to

2123
01:23:37,440 --> 01:23:41,520
create a symmetrical image is to mirror

2124
01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:44,000
literally any picture along a vertical

2125
01:23:41,520 --> 01:23:47,280
line. To choose a random example, if we

2126
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:47,280
were to take the portrait of King

2127
01:23:48,040 --> 01:23:53,120
Charles, conspiracism is to history and

2128
01:23:50,719 --> 01:23:56,000
media analysis as astrology is to

2129
01:23:53,120 --> 01:23:58,000
astronomy, preodern thinking, postmodern

2130
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:59,920
politics. And this is a little awkward

2131
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:01,600
for Christian conspiracy theorists

2132
01:23:59,920 --> 01:24:03,679
because they're basically practicing a

2133
01:24:01,600 --> 01:24:05,920
form of occult divination. But that

2134
01:24:03,679 --> 01:24:07,920
cognitive dissonance is easily managed

2135
01:24:05,920 --> 01:24:10,639
by projecting their obsession with the

2136
01:24:07,920 --> 01:24:12,960
occult onto the elite. It's because the

2137
01:24:10,639 --> 01:24:16,239
elites are obsessed with the occult that

2138
01:24:12,960 --> 01:24:18,920
everywhere I look, I see occult symbols.

2139
01:24:16,239 --> 01:24:22,159
The elite, again, the so-called

2140
01:24:18,920 --> 01:24:24,800
establishment kings are obsessed with

2141
01:24:22,159 --> 01:24:27,199
the occult. Conspiracists hate the

2142
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:29,280
occult. The way a man posts rants about

2143
01:24:27,199 --> 01:24:31,280
the evils of pornography 20 seconds

2144
01:24:29,280 --> 01:24:34,159
after zipping up his pants. The way the

2145
01:24:31,280 --> 01:24:36,159
Ku Klux Clan hated Catholicism while

2146
01:24:34,159 --> 01:24:39,040
parading around in Spanish Catholic

2147
01:24:36,159 --> 01:24:42,080
capiote hoods. Sometimes haters are fans

2148
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:44,520
in denial. So why does a cult symbolism

2149
01:24:42,080 --> 01:24:46,880
have so many fans? Well, like

2150
01:24:44,520 --> 01:24:48,960
intentionalism, I think a rational

2151
01:24:46,880 --> 01:24:51,440
symbolic thinking is inherently human

2152
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:53,440
and will never go away. Academic history

2153
01:24:51,440 --> 01:24:55,440
and political science will never fully

2154
01:24:53,440 --> 01:24:57,199
replace conspiracism for the same

2155
01:24:55,440 --> 01:24:59,199
reasons that astronomy will never

2156
01:24:57,199 --> 01:25:01,600
completely replace astrology. Because

2157
01:24:59,199 --> 01:25:04,239
the scientific worldview cannot meet all

2158
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:06,239
human needs. Science tells us how things

2159
01:25:04,239 --> 01:25:08,800
happen, but it doesn't tell us why

2160
01:25:06,239 --> 01:25:11,360
things happen. In a certain humanistic

2161
01:25:08,800 --> 01:25:13,679
sense, we rely on symbolism, on

2162
01:25:11,360 --> 01:25:16,080
mythology to inscribe the world with

2163
01:25:13,679 --> 01:25:18,120
meaning. And science destroys that

2164
01:25:16,080 --> 01:25:20,800
mythology. Conspiracism is like

2165
01:25:18,120 --> 01:25:22,199
spirituality and that it re-enchants the

2166
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:24,719
world. It

2167
01:25:22,199 --> 01:25:27,120
remthizes. It denies the meaninglessness

2168
01:25:24,719 --> 01:25:29,360
of random chaos on one hand and the

2169
01:25:27,120 --> 01:25:31,920
determinism of scientific laws on the

2170
01:25:29,360 --> 01:25:33,920
other. Divination survives and thrives

2171
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:35,840
in the age of science because there's

2172
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:38,159
important questions that scientific

2173
01:25:35,840 --> 01:25:41,040
rationality cannot answer. Questions

2174
01:25:38,159 --> 01:25:42,719
like, "How do I make sense of grief or

2175
01:25:41,040 --> 01:25:44,960
trauma?" Science doesn't answer

2176
01:25:42,719 --> 01:25:47,120
questions like that. So, we all practice

2177
01:25:44,960 --> 01:25:49,760
some form of witchcraft, whether it's

2178
01:25:47,120 --> 01:25:52,080
prayer, astrology. I mean, I believe in

2179
01:25:49,760 --> 01:25:55,199
psychoanalysis. There has to be a point

2180
01:25:52,080 --> 01:25:56,880
at which dad comes home. It's like daddy

2181
01:25:55,199 --> 01:25:58,320
arrived and he's taking his belt off.

2182
01:25:56,880 --> 01:26:01,199
You know, when something horrible like

2183
01:25:58,320 --> 01:26:03,520
9/11 happens, we want to know why. Not

2184
01:26:01,199 --> 01:26:05,840
just in a structural engineering sense.

2185
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:08,239
We want it to mean something. It's not

2186
01:26:05,840 --> 01:26:10,719
why in the sense of physical causation.

2187
01:26:08,239 --> 01:26:12,560
It's why in the sense of my god, why

2188
01:26:10,719 --> 01:26:15,120
have you forsaken me? What is the

2189
01:26:12,560 --> 01:26:17,199
meaning of this? 15 years ago, I came

2190
01:26:15,120 --> 01:26:20,320
across this conspiracist breakdown of

2191
01:26:17,199 --> 01:26:22,800
the occult numerology of 9/11. It uses

2192
01:26:20,320 --> 01:26:26,000
numerology, tarot, and kabala to

2193
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:28,639
discover the esoteric meaning of 9/11.

2194
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:30,960
quote, "A mass sacrifice ritual invoking

2195
01:26:28,639 --> 01:26:33,040
destruction of the divine union to

2196
01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:34,880
provoke a response of blind violence

2197
01:26:33,040 --> 01:26:37,040
based in fear." There's a kind of

2198
01:26:34,880 --> 01:26:39,199
proportionality bias here, too.

2199
01:26:37,040 --> 01:26:42,000
Meaningful events should have meaningful

2200
01:26:39,199 --> 01:26:43,600
causes. Maybe this 9/11 ritual meme

2201
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:45,440
brought some kind of comfort to the

2202
01:26:43,600 --> 01:26:47,920
person who made it. And is that so

2203
01:26:45,440 --> 01:26:50,239
wrong? If it's okay to use astrology to

2204
01:26:47,920 --> 01:26:52,560
make sense of personal trauma, then is

2205
01:26:50,239 --> 01:26:54,719
it really so bad to use conspiracist

2206
01:26:52,560 --> 01:26:59,679
media mansy to make sense of political

2207
01:26:54,719 --> 01:27:01,840
trauma? Well, yes. Yes, it is. Why?

2208
01:26:59,679 --> 01:27:03,920
Divination has its place as long as

2209
01:27:01,840 --> 01:27:06,800
divination knows its place. And

2210
01:27:03,920 --> 01:27:09,199
conspiracist divination never knows its

2211
01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:11,120
place. It's virtually always in conflict

2212
01:27:09,199 --> 01:27:13,440
with more rational ways of understanding

2213
01:27:11,120 --> 01:27:15,600
politics. And for that reason, it's a

2214
01:27:13,440 --> 01:27:17,600
menace to democracy. A voter who's

2215
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:19,440
engaging with politics by searching for

2216
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:22,080
reptilian symbols and public

2217
01:27:19,440 --> 01:27:24,400
architecture is not fact-checking claims

2218
01:27:22,080 --> 01:27:26,080
about immigrants eating pets, much less

2219
01:27:24,400 --> 01:27:28,719
developing informed opinions about

2220
01:27:26,080 --> 01:27:31,400
tariffs. And worse, the confirmation

2221
01:27:28,719 --> 01:27:33,280
bias and unfalsifiability of symbolic

2222
01:27:31,400 --> 01:27:35,920
interpretation means that every

2223
01:27:33,280 --> 01:27:38,239
prejudice is amplified to extremes and

2224
01:27:35,920 --> 01:27:40,320
immunized against debunking. If

2225
01:27:38,239 --> 01:27:42,480
conspiracists are homophobic, they'll

2226
01:27:40,320 --> 01:27:44,560
divine symbolic evidence of a gay

2227
01:27:42,480 --> 01:27:46,239
conspiracy. If they're anti-Semitic,

2228
01:27:44,560 --> 01:27:48,960
they'll divine symbolic evidence of a

2229
01:27:46,239 --> 01:27:51,520
Jewish conspiracy. And if they're 46% of

2230
01:27:48,960 --> 01:27:53,440
Trump voters in 2016, they'll conclude

2231
01:27:51,520 --> 01:27:55,600
on the basis of symbolism and artwork

2232
01:27:53,440 --> 01:27:57,679
owned by Tony Podesta and references to

2233
01:27:55,600 --> 01:27:59,920
hot dogs and Hillary Clinton's emails

2234
01:27:57,679 --> 01:28:02,080
that Democratic politicians are enacting

2235
01:27:59,920 --> 01:28:05,120
satanic pedo rituals in the basement of

2236
01:28:02,080 --> 01:28:07,120
a pizza parlor. What is it about rituals

2237
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:09,679
in particular that is so endlessly

2238
01:28:07,120 --> 01:28:12,320
fascinating to conspiracists? 9/11 is a

2239
01:28:09,679 --> 01:28:14,400
ritual. Celebrities in drag is a ritual.

2240
01:28:12,320 --> 01:28:16,159
celebrities out of drag is a ritual. The

2241
01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:18,480
conspiracy theory is never just that the

2242
01:28:16,159 --> 01:28:21,600
elites are abusing children. It's always

2243
01:28:18,480 --> 01:28:23,679
specifically ritual abuse or ritual

2244
01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:25,840
murder. So, what is so important about

2245
01:28:23,679 --> 01:28:27,360
rituals? I want to go down that rabbit

2246
01:28:25,840 --> 01:28:29,760
hole, but it's definitely going to get

2247
01:28:27,360 --> 01:28:31,600
me demonetized. So, I'd like to take a

2248
01:28:29,760 --> 01:28:33,840
moment to thank this video's sponsors.

2249
01:28:31,600 --> 01:28:36,239
The Clinton Foundation, the Bilderberg

2250
01:28:33,840 --> 01:28:38,400
Group, Bohemian Club, the Scottish Rate

2251
01:28:36,239 --> 01:28:41,040
of Freemasonry, the Council on Foreign

2252
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:42,960
Relations, World Bank, the Trilateral

2253
01:28:41,040 --> 01:28:45,280
Commission, the Jesuit Order, the

2254
01:28:42,960 --> 01:28:48,159
Chinese Communist Party, the Temple of

2255
01:28:45,280 --> 01:28:51,920
Satan, the Rothschild Estate, Galactic

2256
01:28:48,159 --> 01:28:53,840
Emperor Zenu, and Curiosity Stream. Just

2257
01:28:51,920 --> 01:28:55,920
kidding. I'll be lying in the cold dead

2258
01:28:53,840 --> 01:28:58,239
ground before I take a goddamn scent

2259
01:28:55,920 --> 01:29:01,600
from Curiosity Stream. I have a little

2260
01:28:58,239 --> 01:29:01,600
thing called

2261
01:29:02,770 --> 01:29:09,600
[Music]

2262
01:29:04,920 --> 01:29:09,600
integrity. Part four, the

2263
01:29:10,470 --> 01:29:17,960
[Music]

2264
01:29:15,880 --> 01:29:20,199
ritual. Dark

2265
01:29:17,960 --> 01:29:22,830
mother, cold

2266
01:29:20,199 --> 01:29:25,639
mother, cruel mother.

2267
01:29:22,830 --> 01:29:29,560
[Music]

2268
01:29:25,639 --> 01:29:31,080
What is the

2269
01:29:29,560 --> 01:29:34,159
password?

2270
01:29:31,080 --> 01:29:36,400
No, I mean the Wi-Fi password. I can't

2271
01:29:34,159 --> 01:29:38,320
get any signal out here, which is why I

2272
01:29:36,400 --> 01:29:39,920
wish we'd do this in the city so I don't

2273
01:29:38,320 --> 01:29:41,840
have to drive out to New Jersey in the

2274
01:29:39,920 --> 01:29:45,520
middle of the night every time we have a

2275
01:29:41,840 --> 01:29:47,760
goddamn orgy. So, there's this fixation

2276
01:29:45,520 --> 01:29:50,320
among conspiracists on the real and

2277
01:29:47,760 --> 01:29:52,800
imagined rituals of the elite. For

2278
01:29:50,320 --> 01:29:54,719
example, the transvestigation conspiracy

2279
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:57,360
theory alleges that virtually every

2280
01:29:54,719 --> 01:29:59,679
celebrity is secretly transgender due to

2281
01:29:57,360 --> 01:30:02,880
some kind of elite luciferian initiation

2282
01:29:59,679 --> 01:30:05,120
ritual as evidenced by, for example,

2283
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:07,760
this diagram of World War II General

2284
01:30:05,120 --> 01:30:09,520
Douglas MacArthur's voluuptuous female

2285
01:30:07,760 --> 01:30:10,960
breasts. We're through the looking glass

2286
01:30:09,520 --> 01:30:12,960
here, people. To understand this

2287
01:30:10,960 --> 01:30:16,000
obsession, we need to ask, what is the

2288
01:30:12,960 --> 01:30:18,000
purpose of ritual? Well, ritual binds

2289
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:20,639
communities together. And like

2290
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:23,639
symbolism, ritual creates meaning and

2291
01:30:20,639 --> 01:30:25,760
clarifies social status. Coronations,

2292
01:30:23,639 --> 01:30:27,760
inaugurations, weddings, the reading of

2293
01:30:25,760 --> 01:30:29,920
a judicial verdict, all of these are

2294
01:30:27,760 --> 01:30:32,239
rituals that authorize certain

2295
01:30:29,920 --> 01:30:34,400
relationships of power. So it makes

2296
01:30:32,239 --> 01:30:36,960
sense that if there were secret powers

2297
01:30:34,400 --> 01:30:38,800
behind the throne, then those powers

2298
01:30:36,960 --> 01:30:40,719
would have secret rituals. And

2299
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:43,120
conspiracists often tried to demonstrate

2300
01:30:40,719 --> 01:30:45,840
the existence of the secret powers by

2301
01:30:43,120 --> 01:30:48,400
exposing the secret rituals. In the late

2302
01:30:45,840 --> 01:30:51,040
90s, there was a young conspiracy

2303
01:30:48,400 --> 01:30:54,159
theorist who hosted a local radio show

2304
01:30:51,040 --> 01:30:56,480
in Austin, Texas. His name was Alex

2305
01:30:54,159 --> 01:30:59,600
Jones. One of his first moments in the

2306
01:30:56,480 --> 01:31:02,960
national spotlight was his Y2K video,

2307
01:30:59,600 --> 01:31:05,679
Dark Secrets, Inside Bohemian Grove. I

2308
01:31:02,960 --> 01:31:08,800
have a copy right here on VHS. Let's

2309
01:31:05,679 --> 01:31:10,719
watch it now. Hello, I'm Alex Jones and

2310
01:31:08,800 --> 01:31:13,280
I'm a radio and television host based in

2311
01:31:10,719 --> 01:31:15,600
Austin, Texas. And for many years, I've

2312
01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:18,000
been exposing the criminal activities of

2313
01:31:15,600 --> 01:31:20,239
the global elite, also known as the New

2314
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:22,719
World Order. In this video, Alex

2315
01:31:20,239 --> 01:31:24,239
infiltrates the Bohemian Club, which is

2316
01:31:22,719 --> 01:31:26,480
essentially a fraternity for rich

2317
01:31:24,239 --> 01:31:28,719
middle-aged men who meet yearly at a

2318
01:31:26,480 --> 01:31:30,880
campground north of San Francisco to

2319
01:31:28,719 --> 01:31:33,360
perform a ceremony called the Cremation

2320
01:31:30,880 --> 01:31:36,480
of Care, in which an effigy representing

2321
01:31:33,360 --> 01:31:39,040
the dull cares of daily life is burnt at

2322
01:31:36,480 --> 01:31:42,159
an altar beneath a giant statue of an

2323
01:31:39,040 --> 01:31:44,480
owl. Participants in this cheeky frat

2324
01:31:42,159 --> 01:31:48,000
boy pageant have included presidents

2325
01:31:44,480 --> 01:31:50,320
Bush Jr. and senior Reagan, Eisenhower,

2326
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:51,840
Hoover, and Richard Nixon, who once

2327
01:31:50,320 --> 01:31:54,400
referred to the cremation of care as

2328
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:56,719
quote, "the mosty godamned thing you

2329
01:31:54,400 --> 01:31:58,560
could ever imagine." Alex insists we

2330
01:31:56,719 --> 01:32:00,719
should all be horrified by the cremation

2331
01:31:58,560 --> 01:32:04,480
of care, which he describes as an

2332
01:32:00,719 --> 01:32:05,320
ancient Canaanite Luciferian Babylon

2333
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:07,760
mystery

2334
01:32:05,320 --> 01:32:10,000
religion ceremony. The centerpiece of

2335
01:32:07,760 --> 01:32:12,800
the documentary is a secret footage Alex

2336
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:14,880
took of the ceremony, which is simply

2337
01:32:12,800 --> 01:32:20,520
embarrassing for everyone involved.

2338
01:32:14,880 --> 01:32:24,920
Beyond all care, and all the winds make

2339
01:32:20,520 --> 01:32:29,490
without fellowships, eternal flame once

2340
01:32:24,920 --> 01:32:32,080
again. Midsummer sets us free.

2341
01:32:29,490 --> 01:32:33,280
[Applause]

2342
01:32:32,080 --> 01:32:35,679
See, this is why I don't hang out with

2343
01:32:33,280 --> 01:32:37,440
rich people. They're not cool. Stop

2344
01:32:35,679 --> 01:32:39,360
making them look cool, Alex. The

2345
01:32:37,440 --> 01:32:41,199
documentary ends with Alex standing

2346
01:32:39,360 --> 01:32:43,360
outside the Texas capital building with

2347
01:32:41,199 --> 01:32:45,360
a megaphone, screaming about how then

2348
01:32:43,360 --> 01:32:47,360
Governor George Bush is a Luciferian

2349
01:32:45,360 --> 01:32:48,960
occultist. This is how George Bush

2350
01:32:47,360 --> 01:32:51,960
dresses right here when he's in the

2351
01:32:48,960 --> 01:32:55,679
Bohemian Grove. He is nothing but a

2352
01:32:51,960 --> 01:32:59,690
Luciferian twit. A Luciferian twit.

2353
01:32:55,679 --> 01:33:00,880
Bush. He may be on.

2354
01:32:59,690 --> 01:33:02,800
[Applause]

2355
01:33:00,880 --> 01:33:04,880
Okay, this is a little bit charming. I

2356
01:33:02,800 --> 01:33:07,120
admit I kind of enjoy Alex Jones early

2357
01:33:04,880 --> 01:33:08,880
work before he went mainstream. The

2358
01:33:07,120 --> 01:33:11,360
whole point of the Bohemian Grove video

2359
01:33:08,880 --> 01:33:13,520
is Alex seems to think that this mock

2360
01:33:11,360 --> 01:33:15,600
ritual sacrifice is something that

2361
01:33:13,520 --> 01:33:17,920
should shock us to the core. He also

2362
01:33:15,600 --> 01:33:20,480
absurdly implies that real child

2363
01:33:17,920 --> 01:33:22,000
sacrifices take place at Bohemian Grove

2364
01:33:20,480 --> 01:33:24,400
despite the fact that he has the whole

2365
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:27,080
thing on video and clearly no children

2366
01:33:24,400 --> 01:33:31,040
are sacrificed. mock human

2367
01:33:27,080 --> 01:33:34,080
sacrifices they claim just shocks the

2368
01:33:31,040 --> 01:33:36,159
very foundations of what Americans

2369
01:33:34,080 --> 01:33:37,679
believe their leaders to be. It's like

2370
01:33:36,159 --> 01:33:39,600
when conspiracists site Marina

2371
01:33:37,679 --> 01:33:42,000
Abramovich performance art or the

2372
01:33:39,600 --> 01:33:44,560
Rothschild surrealist ball as evidence

2373
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:46,320
of elite satanic cannibalism. You know,

2374
01:33:44,560 --> 01:33:48,400
because one time someone ate a cake

2375
01:33:46,320 --> 01:33:50,560
shaped like a person. Did you ever eat a

2376
01:33:48,400 --> 01:33:53,040
gingerbread man? Are you a cannibal?

2377
01:33:50,560 --> 01:33:54,800
Don't be stupid. You're a monster. You

2378
01:33:53,040 --> 01:33:56,480
know, ancient Romans accused Christians

2379
01:33:54,800 --> 01:33:58,320
of cannibalism because they talk of

2380
01:33:56,480 --> 01:33:59,920
eating and drinking their god.

2381
01:33:58,320 --> 01:34:01,679
Christians of all people should

2382
01:33:59,920 --> 01:34:04,239
understand the concept of a symbolic

2383
01:34:01,679 --> 01:34:06,159
human sacrifice. Isn't that like the

2384
01:34:04,239 --> 01:34:08,239
entire basis of your religion? What

2385
01:34:06,159 --> 01:34:09,920
exactly is so horrifying about a bunch

2386
01:34:08,239 --> 01:34:12,320
of old men getting drunk in the woods

2387
01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:13,600
and doing fruity rituals? We do still

2388
01:34:12,320 --> 01:34:14,800
have freedom of religion in this

2389
01:34:13,600 --> 01:34:17,040
country, which means you're allowed to

2390
01:34:14,800 --> 01:34:18,639
do whatever fruity rituals you want. I

2391
01:34:17,040 --> 01:34:20,880
think there is a grain of truth though

2392
01:34:18,639 --> 01:34:23,520
in conspiracist paranoia about secret

2393
01:34:20,880 --> 01:34:25,600
societies like the Bohemian Club or the

2394
01:34:23,520 --> 01:34:28,159
Bilderberg Group or maybe early in

2395
01:34:25,600 --> 01:34:29,760
American history the Freemasons. But it

2396
01:34:28,159 --> 01:34:30,960
has nothing to do with rituals. The

2397
01:34:29,760 --> 01:34:33,360
grain of truth is that there is

2398
01:34:30,960 --> 01:34:35,199
something undemocratic about a bunch of

2399
01:34:33,360 --> 01:34:38,000
men with a disproportionate grip on

2400
01:34:35,199 --> 01:34:40,320
power gathering behind closed doors. If

2401
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:41,840
that's your argument, then I agree. But

2402
01:34:40,320 --> 01:34:43,440
that's not what conspiracists are

2403
01:34:41,840 --> 01:34:45,600
saying. They're not saying that secret

2404
01:34:43,440 --> 01:34:48,400
societies are undemocratic. They're

2405
01:34:45,600 --> 01:34:50,159
saying that secret societies are satanic

2406
01:34:48,400 --> 01:34:52,000
and that's why they're fixated on the

2407
01:34:50,159 --> 01:34:54,960
rituals. They think the rituals are

2408
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:58,239
satanic and therefore they suspect that

2409
01:34:54,960 --> 01:35:01,120
child sacrifice is involved. Okay, so we

2410
01:34:58,239 --> 01:35:03,040
finally arrived at satanic ritual baby

2411
01:35:01,120 --> 01:35:05,920
killing. The moment you've all been

2412
01:35:03,040 --> 01:35:08,719
waiting for. Satanic ritual baby killing

2413
01:35:05,920 --> 01:35:11,040
is a classic conspiracy trope with a

2414
01:35:08,719 --> 01:35:13,520
long and ugly history. In the Middle

2415
01:35:11,040 --> 01:35:16,000
Ages, ritual child murder was an

2416
01:35:13,520 --> 01:35:18,639
accusation made in witch trials and an

2417
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:20,880
anti-Jewish blood liel. In the US, one

2418
01:35:18,639 --> 01:35:23,600
of the best-selling books of the 1830s

2419
01:35:20,880 --> 01:35:25,920
was an anti-atholic hoax called awful

2420
01:35:23,600 --> 01:35:28,719
disclosures of Maria Monk, which claimed

2421
01:35:25,920 --> 01:35:31,040
that so-called black nuns were forcing

2422
01:35:28,719 --> 01:35:33,040
initiates to have debauched sex with

2423
01:35:31,040 --> 01:35:35,679
local priests and that the resulting

2424
01:35:33,040 --> 01:35:37,840
babies were baptized, strangled, and

2425
01:35:35,679 --> 01:35:40,000
buried in secret tombs beneath the

2426
01:35:37,840 --> 01:35:42,159
convent. This was part of a nivist

2427
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:44,080
backlash against immigrants from Ireland

2428
01:35:42,159 --> 01:35:46,320
and Germany along with a bunch of other

2429
01:35:44,080 --> 01:35:48,159
conspiracy theories about a papist plot

2430
01:35:46,320 --> 01:35:50,800
to destroy America through mass

2431
01:35:48,159 --> 01:35:52,800
migration secretly subsidized by the

2432
01:35:50,800 --> 01:35:55,440
Catholic powers of Europe. People in

2433
01:35:52,800 --> 01:35:57,520
this country truly never learn.

2434
01:35:55,440 --> 01:36:00,080
Meanwhile, in the Catholic powers of

2435
01:35:57,520 --> 01:36:03,440
Europe, a panic occurred in the 1880s

2436
01:36:00,080 --> 01:36:06,320
when a series of books exposed a secret

2437
01:36:03,440 --> 01:36:08,960
luciferian cult within Freemasonry that

2438
01:36:06,320 --> 01:36:11,199
worshiped Ba'am, held satanic orgies,

2439
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:12,800
and was plotting to destroy the papacy.

2440
01:36:11,199 --> 01:36:16,159
This was all revealed to be a hoax by

2441
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:17,920
the writer Lao Taxile in 1897. Not that

2442
01:36:16,159 --> 01:36:20,560
that stops conspiracists from treating

2443
01:36:17,920 --> 01:36:22,719
it as fact to this day. You know, maybe

2444
01:36:20,560 --> 01:36:25,440
the decline in Freemasonry is the reason

2445
01:36:22,719 --> 01:36:28,000
there's a male loneliness epidemic. Stop

2446
01:36:25,440 --> 01:36:31,800
posting incel [ __ ] online and join your

2447
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:31,800
local Masonic lodge.

2448
01:36:32,320 --> 01:36:40,000
Devil worship, exposing Satan's

2449
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:42,080
underground. In the 1980s, this is

2450
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:46,199
getting old fast, there was a witch hunt

2451
01:36:42,080 --> 01:36:46,199
known as the Satanic Panic.

2452
01:36:46,960 --> 01:36:51,920
We have to give a blood sacrifice to

2453
01:36:49,199 --> 01:36:54,400
Satan. An obsessive fascination with sex

2454
01:36:51,920 --> 01:36:56,639
and drugs and yes, heavy metal rock and

2455
01:36:54,400 --> 01:36:59,440
roll. The other face of adult Satanism

2456
01:36:56,639 --> 01:37:01,199
is violent and fish centered on sexual

2457
01:36:59,440 --> 01:37:03,119
ritual and torture, frequently

2458
01:37:01,199 --> 01:37:05,840
descending into the violist crime of

2459
01:37:03,119 --> 01:37:08,000
all, sexual abuse of children. Dungeons

2460
01:37:05,840 --> 01:37:10,199
and Dragons. Some claim it's a simple

2461
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:13,600
harmless game. It's all

2462
01:37:10,199 --> 01:37:16,000
imagination, is it?

2463
01:37:13,600 --> 01:37:18,480
The Satanic Panic began in Canada with

2464
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:21,119
the publication of Michelle Remembers, a

2465
01:37:18,480 --> 01:37:23,440
supposedly non-fiction memoir recounting

2466
01:37:21,119 --> 01:37:25,920
Catholic psychiatrist Lawrence Pastor's

2467
01:37:23,440 --> 01:37:28,159
hypnotherapy sessions with his patient

2468
01:37:25,920 --> 01:37:30,480
turned wife, Michelle Smith. In a

2469
01:37:28,159 --> 01:37:32,639
hypnotic trance, Michelle allegedly

2470
01:37:30,480 --> 01:37:34,560
recovered repressed memories of being

2471
01:37:32,639 --> 01:37:37,119
surrendered by her mother at the age of

2472
01:37:34,560 --> 01:37:39,320
five to a satanic cult whose rituals

2473
01:37:37,119 --> 01:37:43,880
included demonic

2474
01:37:39,320 --> 01:37:48,440
orgies, Bible defecation, forced

2475
01:37:43,880 --> 01:37:52,000
cannibalism, serpent fornication, kitten

2476
01:37:48,440 --> 01:37:54,880
sacrifice, baby crucifixion. This

2477
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:57,679
apparently very convincing testimony was

2478
01:37:54,880 --> 01:38:00,320
promoted by Oprah and spread worldwide

2479
01:37:57,679 --> 01:38:02,560
with 12,000 accusations of satanic

2480
01:38:00,320 --> 01:38:04,880
ritual abuse leading to dozens of

2481
01:38:02,560 --> 01:38:07,199
convictions and years of jail time for

2482
01:38:04,880 --> 01:38:09,360
innocent daycare workers. Certain

2483
01:38:07,199 --> 01:38:11,040
American police officers even appointed

2484
01:38:09,360 --> 01:38:13,199
themselves leaders of the Grand

2485
01:38:11,040 --> 01:38:16,239
Inquisition, resulting in the certified

2486
01:38:13,199 --> 01:38:21,239
VHS classic law enforcement guide to

2487
01:38:16,239 --> 01:38:21,239
satanic cults. Let's watch it now.

2488
01:38:24,080 --> 01:38:29,679
There's two different communities that

2489
01:38:25,520 --> 01:38:31,760
use this park. Uh one is the uh pagan or

2490
01:38:29,679 --> 01:38:33,639
occultic community and the other

2491
01:38:31,760 --> 01:38:36,800
community is of course the homosexual

2492
01:38:33,639 --> 01:38:38,880
community. Interestingly enough, uh they

2493
01:38:36,800 --> 01:38:40,560
go hand in hand. All law enforcement

2494
01:38:38,880 --> 01:38:42,560
officers should be familiar with the

2495
01:38:40,560 --> 01:38:44,080
different types of degeneracy. This is

2496
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:46,719
uh the way cultists tell each other,

2497
01:38:44,080 --> 01:38:49,119
"Hey, we're Satanists and we're

2498
01:38:46,719 --> 01:38:51,199
partying." More than 2 million American

2499
01:38:49,119 --> 01:38:53,119
children each year are reported missing.

2500
01:38:51,199 --> 01:38:55,280
The ceremonies involve rape and sexual

2501
01:38:53,119 --> 01:38:57,920
assault, sodomy, animal and human

2502
01:38:55,280 --> 01:39:00,880
sacrifices, and often the slaughter of

2503
01:38:57,920 --> 01:39:02,639
unbaptized infants. Sex with demons is

2504
01:39:00,880 --> 01:39:04,400
primary. My favorite part of this video

2505
01:39:02,639 --> 01:39:06,320
is where they just list a series of

2506
01:39:04,400 --> 01:39:08,960
atrocities supposedly committed by

2507
01:39:06,320 --> 01:39:11,119
Satanists, but there's this '8s synth

2508
01:39:08,960 --> 01:39:13,400
funk in the background the entire time.

2509
01:39:11,119 --> 01:39:17,040
sexual trafficking of

2510
01:39:13,400 --> 01:39:17,040
children, corpse

2511
01:39:17,239 --> 01:39:23,199
theft, pornography. So with Pizzagate,

2512
01:39:20,639 --> 01:39:25,920
QAnon, and the general satanic pedo

2513
01:39:23,199 --> 01:39:28,400
cabal conspiracies, these same satanic

2514
01:39:25,920 --> 01:39:30,880
ritual abuse accusations are directed

2515
01:39:28,400 --> 01:39:33,760
not at witches, Jews, Freemasons,

2516
01:39:30,880 --> 01:39:35,679
Catholics, or daycare workers, but at

2517
01:39:33,760 --> 01:39:37,440
the elites. And because this is

2518
01:39:35,679 --> 01:39:39,920
primarily a right-wing conspiracy

2519
01:39:37,440 --> 01:39:42,360
theory, the elites in question are

2520
01:39:39,920 --> 01:39:44,719
mainly Hollywood actors and liberal

2521
01:39:42,360 --> 01:39:47,040
politicians. Now, we have to acknowledge

2522
01:39:44,719 --> 01:39:49,520
another grain of truth here. The idea of

2523
01:39:47,040 --> 01:39:52,560
elite sex criminals seems plausible to

2524
01:39:49,520 --> 01:39:55,119
people in part because there are in fact

2525
01:39:52,560 --> 01:39:56,880
numerous elite sex criminals. Godamn

2526
01:39:55,119 --> 01:39:59,440
Jeffrey Epstein gave a lot of

2527
01:39:56,880 --> 01:40:01,199
credibility to this. However, there is a

2528
01:39:59,440 --> 01:40:03,440
considerable gap between Jeffrey

2529
01:40:01,199 --> 01:40:04,960
Epstein, the real life sex criminal,

2530
01:40:03,440 --> 01:40:07,280
well, the real dead sex criminal, and

2531
01:40:04,960 --> 01:40:09,679
the conspiracist fantasy of the satanic

2532
01:40:07,280 --> 01:40:11,679
pedo cabal. For one thing, there's no

2533
01:40:09,679 --> 01:40:13,679
evidence that Epstein was a Satanist.

2534
01:40:11,679 --> 01:40:15,119
And according to the victims, you know,

2535
01:40:13,679 --> 01:40:17,880
if you actually care what the victims

2536
01:40:15,119 --> 01:40:20,159
have to say, he was, if anything,

2537
01:40:17,880 --> 01:40:22,320
unceremonious. So why then did he commit

2538
01:40:20,159 --> 01:40:24,480
his crimes if not for the sake of evil

2539
01:40:22,320 --> 01:40:26,480
occultic rituals? Well, I think it's

2540
01:40:24,480 --> 01:40:28,639
safe to infer he was basically a high

2541
01:40:26,480 --> 01:40:31,600
libido sociopath with enough power to

2542
01:40:28,639 --> 01:40:33,760
get away with it. And it also seems like

2543
01:40:31,600 --> 01:40:36,159
beautiful girls were a kind of status

2544
01:40:33,760 --> 01:40:38,880
symbol to him and a currency he could

2545
01:40:36,159 --> 01:40:40,880
use to influence other powerful men. You

2546
01:40:38,880 --> 01:40:43,199
know what the real conspiracy is?

2547
01:40:40,880 --> 01:40:45,520
Patriarchy, fun. When you strip away the

2548
01:40:43,199 --> 01:40:48,159
fantasy of satanic rituals, what Jeffrey

2549
01:40:45,520 --> 01:40:50,800
Epstein actually did is he treated women

2550
01:40:48,159 --> 01:40:52,400
and girls like commodities. And I think

2551
01:40:50,800 --> 01:40:54,560
it's emotionally challenging for people

2552
01:40:52,400 --> 01:40:57,920
to confront that because treating women

2553
01:40:54,560 --> 01:41:00,719
and girls like commodities is benol.

2554
01:40:57,920 --> 01:41:02,400
It's ordinary. Most men do it to some

2555
01:41:00,719 --> 01:41:04,880
extent. And not because men are

2556
01:41:02,400 --> 01:41:07,040
inherently evil, but because society

2557
01:41:04,880 --> 01:41:09,119
empowers them to do it. Hey, when you're

2558
01:41:07,040 --> 01:41:10,480
a star, they let you do it. You can do

2559
01:41:09,119 --> 01:41:12,639
anything. Whatever you want. Grab them

2560
01:41:10,480 --> 01:41:15,119
by the

2561
01:41:12,639 --> 01:41:17,119
You can do anything. And because this is

2562
01:41:15,119 --> 01:41:18,880
the internet, I need to clarify that I

2563
01:41:17,119 --> 01:41:20,800
don't hate men. I'm not trying to

2564
01:41:18,880 --> 01:41:23,360
castrate anyone. I'm not trying to

2565
01:41:20,800 --> 01:41:25,199
cuckold anyone. I'm not trying to strap

2566
01:41:23,360 --> 01:41:29,199
on a high heeled boot and step on

2567
01:41:25,199 --> 01:41:31,440
anyone's andor but I'm just I'm just

2568
01:41:29,199 --> 01:41:33,600
asking questions. Why didn't Trump's

2569
01:41:31,440 --> 01:41:36,719
grab him by the [ __ ] boast end his

2570
01:41:33,600 --> 01:41:39,199
political career in 2016? Well, because

2571
01:41:36,719 --> 01:41:42,080
men say things like that all the time.

2572
01:41:39,199 --> 01:41:44,719
Male sexual domination is normal. But

2573
01:41:42,080 --> 01:41:46,639
Epstein crossed a line. He took it too

2574
01:41:44,719 --> 01:41:49,679
far. And there's a need to make that

2575
01:41:46,639 --> 01:41:52,719
line as sharp as possible to distance

2576
01:41:49,679 --> 01:41:55,280
criminal sexual domination from normal

2577
01:41:52,719 --> 01:41:57,280
sexual domination. And that is one

2578
01:41:55,280 --> 01:42:00,239
function of the satanic ritual abuse

2579
01:41:57,280 --> 01:42:02,560
conspiracy. It denies the benality of

2580
01:42:00,239 --> 01:42:06,000
sexual violence by making sexual

2581
01:42:02,560 --> 01:42:08,560
violence exotic. Conspiracists project

2582
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:10,639
sexual violence outside themselves,

2583
01:42:08,560 --> 01:42:13,360
outside their own families, communities,

2584
01:42:10,639 --> 01:42:16,560
and churches by imagining it as this

2585
01:42:13,360 --> 01:42:18,880
bizarre, incomprehensible evil practiced

2586
01:42:16,560 --> 01:42:20,400
by spiritually deviant elites with

2587
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:22,880
motives that resemble nothing in

2588
01:42:20,400 --> 01:42:24,560
ordinary human psychology. And that way,

2589
01:42:22,880 --> 01:42:27,119
we never have to confront the hypocrisy

2590
01:42:24,560 --> 01:42:29,600
of our own values. That we idealize

2591
01:42:27,119 --> 01:42:31,679
alpha male sexual dominance, but we're

2592
01:42:29,600 --> 01:42:33,679
horrified when powerful men sexually

2593
01:42:31,679 --> 01:42:35,760
dominate. We make a fetish out of

2594
01:42:33,679 --> 01:42:37,679
youthful beauty, but we're horrified

2595
01:42:35,760 --> 01:42:39,360
when someone is sexually attracted to

2596
01:42:37,679 --> 01:42:41,199
the exact quality we've all been

2597
01:42:39,360 --> 01:42:43,199
collectively fetishizing. Like, we

2598
01:42:41,199 --> 01:42:45,920
haven't all heard ordinary men say that

2599
01:42:43,199 --> 01:42:48,480
women hit the wall at 25. I don't need

2600
01:42:45,920 --> 01:42:50,639
to show the OkayCid data, do I? Like, it

2601
01:42:48,480 --> 01:42:52,639
isn't common place to tell teenage girls

2602
01:42:50,639 --> 01:42:54,960
to watch how they dress because it's

2603
01:42:52,639 --> 01:42:56,400
distracting to their teachers and it

2604
01:42:54,960 --> 01:42:58,719
makes their male relatives

2605
01:42:56,400 --> 01:43:00,239
uncomfortable. No, no, we don't need to

2606
01:42:58,719 --> 01:43:03,679
deal with any of that because the

2607
01:43:00,239 --> 01:43:03,679
problem is simply

2608
01:43:04,679 --> 01:43:09,600
Satanists. This kind of distancing

2609
01:43:07,320 --> 01:43:11,920
sensationalism really reached its peak

2610
01:43:09,600 --> 01:43:13,679
with the conspiracy theory known as

2611
01:43:11,920 --> 01:43:16,080
Frazzled Drip. And if you haven't heard

2612
01:43:13,679 --> 01:43:18,400
of this, I'm so excited that I get to be

2613
01:43:16,080 --> 01:43:21,920
the one to tell you. Frazzled or

2614
01:43:18,400 --> 01:43:24,080
frazzled. is the name of a fogloric file

2615
01:43:21,920 --> 01:43:26,639
supposedly discovered on the laptop of

2616
01:43:24,080 --> 01:43:28,960
former US Representative Anthony Weiner,

2617
01:43:26,639 --> 01:43:32,080
which according to internet rumor

2618
01:43:28,960 --> 01:43:35,600
contains a snuff film so depraved it

2619
01:43:32,080 --> 01:43:37,880
made hardened NYPD detectives cry like

2620
01:43:35,600 --> 01:43:40,560
little [ __ ] before committing

2621
01:43:37,880 --> 01:43:43,040
suicide. The video supposedly shows

2622
01:43:40,560 --> 01:43:45,840
Hillary Clinton and her staffer Huma

2623
01:43:43,040 --> 01:43:49,600
Abdine enacting a satanic ritual

2624
01:43:45,840 --> 01:43:52,960
sacrifice in which they

2625
01:43:49,600 --> 01:43:56,080
They rip a little girl's face off of her

2626
01:43:52,960 --> 01:43:58,639
face and take turns wearing the face as

2627
01:43:56,080 --> 01:44:01,360
a mask while committing sadistic sex

2628
01:43:58,639 --> 01:44:03,800
acts and drinking the adrenalized blood

2629
01:44:01,360 --> 01:44:07,280
of this now faceless

2630
01:44:03,800 --> 01:44:10,159
child. Okay. And what happens next? Does

2631
01:44:07,280 --> 01:44:11,760
Squidward unal alive himself? Is a clown

2632
01:44:10,159 --> 01:44:13,199
going to murder me in the bath if I

2633
01:44:11,760 --> 01:44:15,600
don't share this with my top eight

2634
01:44:13,199 --> 01:44:17,440
MySpace friends by midnight? Chad, I

2635
01:44:15,600 --> 01:44:20,000
need you to understand that this

2636
01:44:17,440 --> 01:44:22,880
lowquality creepy pasta is not some

2637
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:26,560
obscure piece of fringe QAnon lore. The

2638
01:44:22,880 --> 01:44:28,960
Frazzled rumor emerged in 2018, but to

2639
01:44:26,560 --> 01:44:31,440
this day, people post about it on

2640
01:44:28,960 --> 01:44:34,239
conspiracy Twitter and conspiracy Reddit

2641
01:44:31,440 --> 01:44:36,320
on like a weekly basis. There's a whole

2642
01:44:34,239 --> 01:44:38,719
extended lore about how wearing a

2643
01:44:36,320 --> 01:44:40,880
child's face as a mask is a common

2644
01:44:38,719 --> 01:44:43,199
adrenochrome harvesting method, and that

2645
01:44:40,880 --> 01:44:45,360
the media is full of symbolism alluding

2646
01:44:43,199 --> 01:44:48,960
to the practice. For example, Lady

2647
01:44:45,360 --> 01:44:50,960
Gaga's outfit at the 2009 VMAs. Guys, if

2648
01:44:48,960 --> 01:44:53,040
you see a red lace dress and your first

2649
01:44:50,960 --> 01:44:55,760
thought is that looks like a child who's

2650
01:44:53,040 --> 01:44:58,719
been skinned alive, the problem is

2651
01:44:55,760 --> 01:45:00,880
within you. See also the Basot painting

2652
01:44:58,719 --> 01:45:03,920
on a hoodie worn by Ellen DeGeneres and

2653
01:45:00,880 --> 01:45:06,400
Jay-Z and Wilson the volleyball from the

2654
01:45:03,920 --> 01:45:08,800
movie Castaway. This last example is

2655
01:45:06,400 --> 01:45:12,159
cited by conspiracists as evidence that

2656
01:45:08,800 --> 01:45:15,600
beloved actor Tom Hanks is in fact a

2657
01:45:12,159 --> 01:45:18,159
sodomistic pedor who routinely gluts

2658
01:45:15,600 --> 01:45:20,960
himself on the adrenochrome rich blood

2659
01:45:18,159 --> 01:45:23,280
of slaughtered children. So anyone who's

2660
01:45:20,960 --> 01:45:26,719
even slightly tethered to reality can

2661
01:45:23,280 --> 01:45:28,719
tell this isn't true. But I, as a close

2662
01:45:26,719 --> 01:45:32,480
personal friend of Hillary, am in a

2663
01:45:28,719 --> 01:45:36,880
unique position to prove it isn't true

2664
01:45:32,480 --> 01:45:39,480
because I have seen the real Frazzle

2665
01:45:36,880 --> 01:45:44,280
Drip. I have it right here on

2666
01:45:39,480 --> 01:45:44,280
VHS. Let's watch it now.

2667
01:45:46,400 --> 01:45:51,600
Place the mask into position as before

2668
01:45:49,119 --> 01:45:52,960
and get ready for a real treat. The

2669
01:45:51,600 --> 01:45:55,080
first time you position the mask,

2670
01:45:52,960 --> 01:45:58,239
sometimes I get the labels on want to

2671
01:45:55,080 --> 01:46:00,320
use to help you align it properly. When

2672
01:45:58,239 --> 01:46:02,560
positioning the mask, the four facial

2673
01:46:00,320 --> 01:46:04,880
contact areas on the mask, it's probably

2674
01:46:02,560 --> 01:46:04,880
this

2675
01:46:09,320 --> 01:46:14,920
one. Oh, yeah. This is

2676
01:46:12,679 --> 01:46:19,560
it. Mother of

2677
01:46:14,920 --> 01:46:19,560
darkness, embrace me.

2678
01:46:20,380 --> 01:46:31,520
[Music]

2679
01:46:28,239 --> 01:46:31,520
Take a [ __ ] sip,

2680
01:46:34,450 --> 01:46:44,070
[Music]

2681
01:46:45,800 --> 01:46:50,679
babes. I love the smell of adrenochrome

2682
01:46:48,639 --> 01:46:54,320
in the morning.

2683
01:46:50,679 --> 01:46:54,320
Satanis, hail

2684
01:46:54,440 --> 01:46:59,920
mool. The arm came off. Hillary, no. I

2685
01:46:58,239 --> 01:47:02,400
can't believe the World Economic Forum

2686
01:46:59,920 --> 01:47:04,719
is paying me to do this. So, at a

2687
01:47:02,400 --> 01:47:07,520
certain point, and we have reached that

2688
01:47:04,719 --> 01:47:09,600
point, conspiracy theory becomes too

2689
01:47:07,520 --> 01:47:11,520
dignified a term for what is essentially

2690
01:47:09,600 --> 01:47:13,440
a perverted form of morbid

2691
01:47:11,520 --> 01:47:15,600
entertainment. I have a good eye for

2692
01:47:13,440 --> 01:47:17,600
perversion because I am a pervert. I

2693
01:47:15,600 --> 01:47:20,560
know how perverts think. So you can

2694
01:47:17,600 --> 01:47:23,280
trust me when I say conspiracists are

2695
01:47:20,560 --> 01:47:25,760
perverts. People who are not perverts do

2696
01:47:23,280 --> 01:47:28,719
not spend this much time thinking about

2697
01:47:25,760 --> 01:47:30,320
debauched satanic sex crimes. Now

2698
01:47:28,719 --> 01:47:33,040
conspiracists will be like, "How dare

2699
01:47:30,320 --> 01:47:35,040
you? We are concerned citizens who are

2700
01:47:33,040 --> 01:47:37,239
saving children and doing our own

2701
01:47:35,040 --> 01:47:39,760
research." No, you're not. No, you're

2702
01:47:37,239 --> 01:47:42,159
not. Posting about celebrity face

2703
01:47:39,760 --> 01:47:44,320
harvesting rituals is not research and

2704
01:47:42,159 --> 01:47:46,239
it's not saving children. and I'm simply

2705
01:47:44,320 --> 01:47:48,159
not going to allow you to get away with

2706
01:47:46,239 --> 01:47:50,960
pretending that it is. I think this

2707
01:47:48,159 --> 01:47:52,800
whole moral crusade is largely an excuse

2708
01:47:50,960 --> 01:47:55,199
for you to spend a lot of time talking

2709
01:47:52,800 --> 01:47:57,679
and thinking about Saudian sexual

2710
01:47:55,199 --> 01:48:00,560
depravity. There's an element of lust in

2711
01:47:57,679 --> 01:48:02,960
every witch hunt. In the 1486 witch

2712
01:48:00,560 --> 01:48:05,280
hunting manual Malayas Malifakarum,

2713
01:48:02,960 --> 01:48:08,560
there's a kind of horny obsession with

2714
01:48:05,280 --> 01:48:10,480
women [ __ ] demons. Incubus, a male

2715
01:48:08,560 --> 01:48:13,040
demonic force that populates with human

2716
01:48:10,480 --> 01:48:15,360
females. Witch trials often involved the

2717
01:48:13,040 --> 01:48:18,000
invasive inspection of women's bodies

2718
01:48:15,360 --> 01:48:20,320
for so-called witches marks. There's a

2719
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:22,360
scene in the law enforcement guide to

2720
01:48:20,320 --> 01:48:24,639
satanic cults

2721
01:48:22,360 --> 01:48:27,119
where you just have to see it to believe

2722
01:48:24,639 --> 01:48:30,159
it. You'll note on our model that

2723
01:48:27,119 --> 01:48:33,199
there's often times a cut that goes from

2724
01:48:30,159 --> 01:48:36,080
behind the ear all the way down to the

2725
01:48:33,199 --> 01:48:38,560
throat. Another area that's obvious in

2726
01:48:36,080 --> 01:48:40,560
these kinds of ritualistic carvings

2727
01:48:38,560 --> 01:48:42,960
would be the pentagram or the inverted

2728
01:48:40,560 --> 01:48:45,520
pentagram on the right and the left side

2729
01:48:42,960 --> 01:48:48,719
of the upper chest. It is our sacred

2730
01:48:45,520 --> 01:48:50,480
obligation to uproot the sexual deviency

2731
01:48:48,719 --> 01:48:52,880
that is corrupting our children and

2732
01:48:50,480 --> 01:48:55,360
putrifying our communities. Now look

2733
01:48:52,880 --> 01:48:57,520
over here at our bikini model whose per

2734
01:48:55,360 --> 01:49:00,080
nubile body we're going to inspect for

2735
01:48:57,520 --> 01:49:02,159
marks of the devil. Another area we'll

2736
01:49:00,080 --> 01:49:04,320
want to note is the foot area. These are

2737
01:49:02,159 --> 01:49:06,719
not serious people. Richard Hoffadder

2738
01:49:04,320 --> 01:49:09,280
said that anti-atholicism has always

2739
01:49:06,719 --> 01:49:11,600
been the pornography of the Puritan.

2740
01:49:09,280 --> 01:49:14,000
Pornography. He was talking about awful

2741
01:49:11,600 --> 01:49:16,800
disclosures and those allegations about

2742
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:19,280
fornicating nuns murdering babies. 19th

2743
01:49:16,800 --> 01:49:21,679
century conspiracists developed a quote

2744
01:49:19,280 --> 01:49:23,600
immense lore about libertine priests,

2745
01:49:21,679 --> 01:49:26,040
the confessional as an opportunity for

2746
01:49:23,600 --> 01:49:29,040
seduction, lentious convents and

2747
01:49:26,040 --> 01:49:31,840
monasteries. Today, satanic panics are

2748
01:49:29,040 --> 01:49:34,000
the pornography of the Puritan. Satan is

2749
01:49:31,840 --> 01:49:36,159
a symbol of temptation and whatever the

2750
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:39,520
Puritan represses in himself he

2751
01:49:36,159 --> 01:49:42,239
attributes to the Satanist. Sex, drugs,

2752
01:49:39,520 --> 01:49:44,800
hedonism, violence, luxury, the eyes

2753
01:49:42,239 --> 01:49:47,280
wide shut style conspiracy of forbidden

2754
01:49:44,800 --> 01:49:49,679
temptations. Well, I've had a very

2755
01:49:47,280 --> 01:49:51,600
interesting look around. The philosopher

2756
01:49:49,679 --> 01:49:54,080
Sart noticed something similar in his

2757
01:49:51,600 --> 01:49:56,239
essay on anti-semitism. He says, "I knew

2758
01:49:54,080 --> 01:49:59,360
a Protestant in whom sexual desire took

2759
01:49:56,239 --> 01:50:01,840
the form of indignation." My god, that's

2760
01:49:59,360 --> 01:50:03,360
disgusting. Naked pics online. Where

2761
01:50:01,840 --> 01:50:05,440
where did he post those? The sight of

2762
01:50:03,360 --> 01:50:07,840
women in bathing suits aroused him to a

2763
01:50:05,440 --> 01:50:10,000
fury. He willingly encouraged that fury

2764
01:50:07,840 --> 01:50:12,719
and passed his time at swimming pools.

2765
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:15,199
Look at that disgusting display. Yes,

2766
01:50:12,719 --> 01:50:17,760
sir. The anti-semite is like that. His

2767
01:50:15,199 --> 01:50:20,159
behavior reflects a curiosity fascinated

2768
01:50:17,760 --> 01:50:22,020
by evil. But above all, I think it

2769
01:50:20,159 --> 01:50:23,239
represents a basic

2770
01:50:22,020 --> 01:50:25,520
[Music]

2771
01:50:23,239 --> 01:50:27,920
sadism. So, what does that mean? What is

2772
01:50:25,520 --> 01:50:29,840
the sadism he's talking about? Well,

2773
01:50:27,920 --> 01:50:32,960
there's two types of sadism in a witch

2774
01:50:29,840 --> 01:50:35,760
hunt. Sadism one is the curiosity

2775
01:50:32,960 --> 01:50:38,400
fascinated by evil. This morbid pleasure

2776
01:50:35,760 --> 01:50:40,719
in denial that we take in going down the

2777
01:50:38,400 --> 01:50:43,280
rabbit hole of sick and twisted crimes

2778
01:50:40,719 --> 01:50:45,840
which we attribute to the witch. Such a

2779
01:50:43,280 --> 01:50:48,719
clever witch to twist the truth to cloud

2780
01:50:45,840 --> 01:50:51,280
the mind with unholy thoughts. Sadism

2781
01:50:48,719 --> 01:50:54,239
too is the pleasure of retribution

2782
01:50:51,280 --> 01:50:56,320
justice served. Burning the witch. I

2783
01:50:54,239 --> 01:50:58,400
think these same two types of sadism are

2784
01:50:56,320 --> 01:51:01,199
the reason police shows like Law and

2785
01:50:58,400 --> 01:51:03,600
Order SVU are so enjoyable. In the

2786
01:51:01,199 --> 01:51:05,280
criminal justice system, sexually based

2787
01:51:03,600 --> 01:51:07,199
offenses are considered especially

2788
01:51:05,280 --> 01:51:10,000
heinous. The framing of a police

2789
01:51:07,199 --> 01:51:12,480
procedural provides a legitimate context

2790
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:15,360
that gives us permission to indulge

2791
01:51:12,480 --> 01:51:18,000
whatever morbid curiosity we may have

2792
01:51:15,360 --> 01:51:20,880
about especially heinous sexually based

2793
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:22,719
offenses. That's sadism one. And then

2794
01:51:20,880 --> 01:51:24,960
because those sexually based offenses

2795
01:51:22,719 --> 01:51:26,880
are so especially heinous, we feel a

2796
01:51:24,960 --> 01:51:29,040
sense of satisfaction when those hero

2797
01:51:26,880 --> 01:51:31,040
cops bring down the hammer of the law on

2798
01:51:29,040 --> 01:51:33,199
whatever creeper pervert of the weak.

2799
01:51:31,040 --> 01:51:35,360
Retribution justice served. That's

2800
01:51:33,199 --> 01:51:38,080
sadism, too. I'll tell you what I think,

2801
01:51:35,360 --> 01:51:39,560
pervert. You can't hide from me behind

2802
01:51:38,080 --> 01:51:42,239
your fancy

2803
01:51:39,560 --> 01:51:45,040
education. I smell you. I think this

2804
01:51:42,239 --> 01:51:47,840
same dynamic explains a type of cultural

2805
01:51:45,040 --> 01:51:49,360
fixation on pedophilia. I mean, it's

2806
01:51:47,840 --> 01:51:52,800
right there in the name of the show.

2807
01:51:49,360 --> 01:51:55,199
It's called To Catch a Predator, not To

2808
01:51:52,800 --> 01:51:57,599
Protect a Child. There are no children

2809
01:51:55,199 --> 01:51:59,840
on that show. In To Catch a Predator,

2810
01:51:57,599 --> 01:52:02,159
the media and the cops collaborate to

2811
01:51:59,840 --> 01:52:04,639
essentially create a crime for the

2812
01:52:02,159 --> 01:52:07,440
purpose of televising the punishment.

2813
01:52:04,639 --> 01:52:09,280
It's entramentainment. And I'm not

2814
01:52:07,440 --> 01:52:11,599
asking anyone to feel sorry for the

2815
01:52:09,280 --> 01:52:13,840
predators they catch. I'm just trying to

2816
01:52:11,599 --> 01:52:16,800
keep it real about the reason that this

2817
01:52:13,840 --> 01:52:18,599
show exists. A lot of people obsess over

2818
01:52:16,800 --> 01:52:21,360
real or imagined crimes against

2819
01:52:18,599 --> 01:52:23,920
children, not out of sincere concern for

2820
01:52:21,360 --> 01:52:25,520
victims. Put our ass back in the cabin,

2821
01:52:23,920 --> 01:52:27,040
but simply because crimes against

2822
01:52:25,520 --> 01:52:29,599
children provide a really good

2823
01:52:27,040 --> 01:52:31,360
justification for retributive violence.

2824
01:52:29,599 --> 01:52:34,480
It's why wararmongering politicians

2825
01:52:31,360 --> 01:52:36,400
often say the enemy is killing babies

2826
01:52:34,480 --> 01:52:38,639
because it's a crime that cries out for

2827
01:52:36,400 --> 01:52:42,400
revenge that warrants unlimited

2828
01:52:38,639 --> 01:52:44,400
retaliation. In 2017, the first ever Q

2829
01:52:42,400 --> 01:52:46,719
drop claimed that Hillary Clinton had

2830
01:52:44,400 --> 01:52:50,159
been arrested and was being extradated.

2831
01:52:46,719 --> 01:52:51,920
So from day one, QAnon was a retributive

2832
01:52:50,159 --> 01:52:53,760
fantasy that appealed to Trump

2833
01:52:51,920 --> 01:52:56,159
supporters who were beginning to wonder

2834
01:52:53,760 --> 01:52:58,960
when the Donald was planning to fulfill

2835
01:52:56,159 --> 01:53:00,880
his campaign promise to lock her up. And

2836
01:52:58,960 --> 01:53:03,920
from there, it escalated into this idea

2837
01:53:00,880 --> 01:53:06,560
of the storm, the public mass executions

2838
01:53:03,920 --> 01:53:08,239
of politicians aligned with the Cabal.

2839
01:53:06,560 --> 01:53:10,639
So that's another function of the

2840
01:53:08,239 --> 01:53:12,960
satanic ritual abuse conspiracy. It

2841
01:53:10,639 --> 01:53:15,520
sanctions violence and it sanctifies

2842
01:53:12,960 --> 01:53:19,199
violence. It makes violence sacred

2843
01:53:15,520 --> 01:53:21,119
because violence against evil is good.

2844
01:53:19,199 --> 01:53:23,040
And what could be more evil than satanic

2845
01:53:21,119 --> 01:53:25,599
pedophiles who murder children and wear

2846
01:53:23,040 --> 01:53:28,639
their faces like a mask. So like to

2847
01:53:25,599 --> 01:53:30,480
catch a predator, Qanon was in many ways

2848
01:53:28,639 --> 01:53:33,679
a bunch of people standing around a

2849
01:53:30,480 --> 01:53:35,599
gallows looking for a criminal to hang.

2850
01:53:33,679 --> 01:53:37,520
Scapegoating, the need to blame and

2851
01:53:35,599 --> 01:53:39,360
punish someone, is where the three

2852
01:53:37,520 --> 01:53:41,520
principles of conspiracism come

2853
01:53:39,360 --> 01:53:44,159
together. Intentionalism, because

2854
01:53:41,520 --> 01:53:46,159
punishment needs a criminal. Dualism,

2855
01:53:44,159 --> 01:53:48,080
because if the criminals are purely

2856
01:53:46,159 --> 01:53:50,480
evil, we can rest assured our violence

2857
01:53:48,080 --> 01:53:52,480
against them is purely righteous. And

2858
01:53:50,480 --> 01:53:54,400
symbolism, because we need a method to

2859
01:53:52,480 --> 01:53:56,239
discover criminals and reveal their

2860
01:53:54,400 --> 01:53:58,639
purely evil nature. This is how a

2861
01:53:56,239 --> 01:54:00,960
cultist talk to each other. This here is

2862
01:53:58,639 --> 01:54:04,320
a psilocybin mushroom. So satanic

2863
01:54:00,960 --> 01:54:06,639
rituals are proof both of guilt and of

2864
01:54:04,320 --> 01:54:08,400
deliberate allegiance to the devil.

2865
01:54:06,639 --> 01:54:11,280
Where does this desire for retaliation

2866
01:54:08,400 --> 01:54:13,520
come from? Why does scapegoating happen?

2867
01:54:11,280 --> 01:54:16,400
Well, one, it can be a response to an

2868
01:54:13,520 --> 01:54:18,320
unintended disaster like COVID 19 where

2869
01:54:16,400 --> 01:54:20,080
conspiracists blamed Bill Gates or the

2870
01:54:18,320 --> 01:54:22,800
World Health Organization or the

2871
01:54:20,080 --> 01:54:25,360
Chinese. Two, it can be a response to an

2872
01:54:22,800 --> 01:54:26,960
actual crime like 9/11, a crime against

2873
01:54:25,360 --> 01:54:28,560
the American people. We couldn't

2874
01:54:26,960 --> 01:54:30,880
retaliate against the hijackers

2875
01:54:28,560 --> 01:54:33,199
obviously, but from the moment the

2876
01:54:30,880 --> 01:54:35,280
second plane hit the south tower, it was

2877
01:54:33,199 --> 01:54:38,080
collectively decided we were going to

2878
01:54:35,280 --> 01:54:39,840
retaliate against someone and Iraq and

2879
01:54:38,080 --> 01:54:42,480
Afghanistan became the surrogate

2880
01:54:39,840 --> 01:54:44,080
victims. We will make no distinction

2881
01:54:42,480 --> 01:54:47,199
between the terrorists who committed

2882
01:54:44,080 --> 01:54:49,760
these acts and those who harbor them.

2883
01:54:47,199 --> 01:54:52,239
Three, scapegoating can be an act of

2884
01:54:49,760 --> 01:54:54,719
projective guilt where our own guilt or

2885
01:54:52,239 --> 01:54:57,440
feeling of guilt is either forgiven or

2886
01:54:54,719 --> 01:54:59,199
repressed by transferring guilt to the

2887
01:54:57,440 --> 01:55:00,480
scapegoat. This is actually closest to

2888
01:54:59,199 --> 01:55:02,880
the origin of the concept of

2889
01:55:00,480 --> 01:55:05,199
scapegoating in Leviticus where on the

2890
01:55:02,880 --> 01:55:06,960
day of atonement, the high priest lays

2891
01:55:05,199 --> 01:55:09,280
his hands on the head of a goat and

2892
01:55:06,960 --> 01:55:11,440
confesses the sins of the Israelites. He

2893
01:55:09,280 --> 01:55:13,679
then sends the goat out into the desert

2894
01:55:11,440 --> 01:55:16,000
symbolically transferring the sins away

2895
01:55:13,679 --> 01:55:18,320
from the community. Conspiracists are

2896
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:20,719
usually not as self-aware about this as

2897
01:55:18,320 --> 01:55:22,880
the Israelites. A month before Edgar

2898
01:55:20,719 --> 01:55:24,560
Madison Welch, the Pizzagate shooter,

2899
01:55:22,880 --> 01:55:27,040
barged into Comet Ping Pong with an

2900
01:55:24,560 --> 01:55:29,040
AR-15, he'd severely injured a

2901
01:55:27,040 --> 01:55:31,520
13-year-old pedestrian in a car

2902
01:55:29,040 --> 01:55:33,920
accident. On his drive to DC, he

2903
01:55:31,520 --> 01:55:36,840
recorded a message to his own kids about

2904
01:55:33,920 --> 01:55:39,280
his duty to protect children. Protect

2905
01:55:36,840 --> 01:55:42,159
people who can't protect themselves.

2906
01:55:39,280 --> 01:55:44,560
The8s satanic panic began when Michelle

2907
01:55:42,159 --> 01:55:48,000
Smith came to her psychiatrist, Dr.

2908
01:55:44,560 --> 01:55:49,840
Pazdar, with severe and persistent grief

2909
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:52,320
she was experiencing over a recent

2910
01:55:49,840 --> 01:55:54,639
miscarriage. And it was only after Dr.

2911
01:55:52,320 --> 01:55:57,280
Pazer encouraged her to free associate

2912
01:55:54,639 --> 01:56:00,000
that she began recovering memories of

2913
01:55:57,280 --> 01:56:04,159
satanic ritual baby killing. Witches

2914
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:06,080
chant and babies burn. Mustn't talk. It

2915
01:56:04,159 --> 01:56:08,800
will be my turn.

2916
01:56:06,080 --> 01:56:11,280
The 9/11 truth movement began before the

2917
01:56:08,800 --> 01:56:13,520
towers even fell and attracted a variety

2918
01:56:11,280 --> 01:56:16,639
of people for a variety of reasons, but

2919
01:56:13,520 --> 01:56:18,639
it didn't peak until 2006, around the

2920
01:56:16,639 --> 01:56:20,880
time American public opinion turned

2921
01:56:18,639 --> 01:56:23,119
against the war in Iraq. There were no

2922
01:56:20,880 --> 01:56:25,040
weapons of mass destruction. A sectarian

2923
01:56:23,119 --> 01:56:27,119
civil war had broken out with no end in

2924
01:56:25,040 --> 01:56:28,639
sight, and photos had been leaked of

2925
01:56:27,119 --> 01:56:31,280
American soldiers running a torture

2926
01:56:28,639 --> 01:56:34,400
prison at Abu Grae. So, it was around

2927
01:56:31,280 --> 01:56:36,880
2006 that Americans began to tell the

2928
01:56:34,400 --> 01:56:39,119
story of that war in the way we tell it

2929
01:56:36,880 --> 01:56:41,280
still. The Bush administration lied

2930
01:56:39,119 --> 01:56:43,679
about weapons of mass destruction and

2931
01:56:41,280 --> 01:56:46,480
tricked us all into going to war. That's

2932
01:56:43,679 --> 01:56:48,400
not entirely false, but it's not the

2933
01:56:46,480 --> 01:56:50,400
whole truth either. Weapons of mass

2934
01:56:48,400 --> 01:56:52,719
destruction were the pretext given, but

2935
01:56:50,400 --> 01:56:54,719
the evidence they provided was not very

2936
01:56:52,719 --> 01:56:57,199
convincing. The UN Security Council

2937
01:56:54,719 --> 01:56:59,040
didn't buy it. France, in particular,

2938
01:56:57,199 --> 01:57:01,280
didn't buy it and was very opposed to

2939
01:56:59,040 --> 01:57:03,840
the war. And Americans spent the next

2940
01:57:01,280 --> 01:57:06,000
several years calling the French cheese

2941
01:57:03,840 --> 01:57:08,159
eating surrender monkeys. I believe that

2942
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:11,360
was the phrase. And renaming French

2943
01:57:08,159 --> 01:57:13,520
fries freedom fries. French's Mustard

2944
01:57:11,360 --> 01:57:15,199
had to release a statement disavowing

2945
01:57:13,520 --> 01:57:17,520
any association with the French

2946
01:57:15,199 --> 01:57:20,960
Republic. The only thing French about

2947
01:57:17,520 --> 01:57:23,599
French's Mustard is the name. Yeah, we

2948
01:57:20,960 --> 01:57:26,080
can tell. So that's how popular

2949
01:57:23,599 --> 01:57:29,920
Operation Iraqi Freedom was with

2950
01:57:26,080 --> 01:57:31,920
Americans in 2003 when 72% of Americans

2951
01:57:29,920 --> 01:57:34,119
supported the invasion and President

2952
01:57:31,920 --> 01:57:36,639
Bush's approval rating went up 13

2953
01:57:34,119 --> 01:57:38,639
points. I think at that particular

2954
01:57:36,639 --> 01:57:40,639
moment, Americans would have been

2955
01:57:38,639 --> 01:57:42,800
willing to go to war with almost any

2956
01:57:40,639 --> 01:57:46,000
Middle Eastern country on almost any

2957
01:57:42,800 --> 01:57:50,480
pretext. Some say this country's just

2958
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:53,599
out of looking for a fight. after 911.

2959
01:57:50,480 --> 01:57:56,320
Man, I'd have to say that's right. Have

2960
01:57:53,599 --> 01:57:58,159
you I was a teenager at the time, but

2961
01:57:56,320 --> 01:58:01,199
I'll never forget the things I heard

2962
01:57:58,159 --> 01:58:03,840
adults openly saying on a regular basis.

2963
01:58:01,199 --> 01:58:07,040
Turn the Middle East to glass. It's too

2964
01:58:03,840 --> 01:58:09,760
bad we didn't win the crusades. Who the

2965
01:58:07,040 --> 01:58:11,440
[ __ ] is we? Christendom. My point is

2966
01:58:09,760 --> 01:58:14,239
that the Bush administration didn't sell

2967
01:58:11,440 --> 01:58:16,320
us anything we didn't want to buy. And

2968
01:58:14,239 --> 01:58:18,800
it took a few years for buyer's remorse

2969
01:58:16,320 --> 01:58:21,360
to set in. Only then did we need a

2970
01:58:18,800 --> 01:58:24,320
scapegoat on whom to pin our guilt for

2971
01:58:21,360 --> 01:58:27,360
the war. And we knew emotionally that

2972
01:58:24,320 --> 01:58:30,320
displaced revenge for 9/11, aka the war

2973
01:58:27,360 --> 01:58:32,880
on terror, was the deeper motivation. So

2974
01:58:30,320 --> 01:58:35,760
blaming Bush for lying about WMDs was

2975
01:58:32,880 --> 01:58:38,239
not enough. We needed 9/11 to have been

2976
01:58:35,760 --> 01:58:40,320
a trick as well. Despite what

2977
01:58:38,239 --> 01:58:42,000
conspiracists said, the real truth we

2978
01:58:40,320 --> 01:58:44,400
couldn't handle was not that the

2979
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:47,840
Illuminati made us go to war, but that

2980
01:58:44,400 --> 01:58:50,840
they didn't. that no one made us do

2981
01:58:47,840 --> 01:58:50,840
anything.

2982
01:58:56,520 --> 01:59:02,679
[Music]

2983
01:59:07,760 --> 01:59:13,840
Part five. It's a big club and you ain't

2984
01:59:11,360 --> 01:59:15,920
in it. Okay. So, you know how a lot of

2985
01:59:13,840 --> 01:59:18,800
comedians when they're 10 years past

2986
01:59:15,920 --> 01:59:20,880
their peak, they stop telling jokes and

2987
01:59:18,800 --> 01:59:23,119
instead just get up on stage and do

2988
01:59:20,880 --> 01:59:25,280
political rants at the audience? Well,

2989
01:59:23,119 --> 01:59:27,440
every comic who does that wishes he was

2990
01:59:25,280 --> 01:59:30,560
George Carlin, a comedian who died in

2991
01:59:27,440 --> 01:59:33,280
2006 and who towards the end did some

2992
01:59:30,560 --> 01:59:34,639
specials with a lot of old man ranting.

2993
01:59:33,280 --> 01:59:36,320
The politicians are put there to give

2994
01:59:34,639 --> 01:59:39,599
you the idea that you have freedom of

2995
01:59:36,320 --> 01:59:42,000
choice. You don't. You have owners. They

2996
01:59:39,599 --> 01:59:44,480
own you. In one of Carllin's famous old

2997
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:47,040
man rants, he talks about how America is

2998
01:59:44,480 --> 01:59:49,280
owned by wealthy business interests.

2999
01:59:47,040 --> 01:59:52,639
This bit culminates in the phrase, "It's

3000
01:59:49,280 --> 01:59:55,199
a big club and you ain't in it." That

3001
01:59:52,639 --> 01:59:57,440
line, "It's a big club and you ain't in

3002
01:59:55,199 --> 01:59:59,599
it," has become a popular conspiracist

3003
01:59:57,440 --> 02:00:01,840
slogan. You see it every day in online

3004
01:59:59,599 --> 02:00:04,639
conspiracy spaces. It captures

3005
02:00:01,840 --> 02:00:06,639
conspiracists core feeling of exclusion,

3006
02:00:04,639 --> 02:00:09,520
the feeling of being an outsider to

3007
02:00:06,639 --> 02:00:12,480
political power, speculating frantically

3008
02:00:09,520 --> 02:00:14,400
about what the insiders are up to. It's

3009
02:00:12,480 --> 02:00:17,119
interesting that conspiracists like this

3010
02:00:14,400 --> 02:00:19,520
line so much because George Carlin was

3011
02:00:17,119 --> 02:00:21,599
not a conspiracist. On a political talk

3012
02:00:19,520 --> 02:00:24,159
show, he name dropped Noom Chsky and

3013
02:00:21,599 --> 02:00:26,800
Howard Zinn, both thinkers I'd consider

3014
02:00:24,159 --> 02:00:28,560
reasonable leftists. Howard Zinn and Nam

3015
02:00:26,800 --> 02:00:30,960
Chsy, those people aren't on TV because

3016
02:00:28,560 --> 02:00:32,800
they have they have intellects and

3017
02:00:30,960 --> 02:00:34,719
they're dissenters. On another talk

3018
02:00:32,800 --> 02:00:37,199
show, Carlin was accused of being a

3019
02:00:34,719 --> 02:00:41,119
conspiracy theorist and he responded,

3020
02:00:37,199 --> 02:00:43,280
"You don't need a formal conspiracy when

3021
02:00:41,119 --> 02:00:45,840
interests converge." That is not

3022
02:00:43,280 --> 02:00:48,000
conspiracist talk. But conspiracists

3023
02:00:45,840 --> 02:00:50,880
claim Carlin as one of their own because

3024
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:53,760
he communicates in populist language and

3025
02:00:50,880 --> 02:00:55,880
populism is inherently ambiguous. It's

3026
02:00:53,760 --> 02:00:58,400
always open to conspiracist

3027
02:00:55,880 --> 02:01:01,199
interpretation. Let's define populism as

3028
02:00:58,400 --> 02:01:04,239
the general idea that we, the common

3029
02:01:01,199 --> 02:01:06,560
people, are in opposition to some they,

3030
02:01:04,239 --> 02:01:09,520
the establishment elite. This is

3031
02:01:06,560 --> 02:01:11,679
extremely vague. And that's the problem.

3032
02:01:09,520 --> 02:01:14,320
Populism can be leftist. It can be

3033
02:01:11,679 --> 02:01:16,719
fascist. It can be liberal, centrist,

3034
02:01:14,320 --> 02:01:19,599
communist. Most political ideologies

3035
02:01:16,719 --> 02:01:23,199
today identify in some way with the

3036
02:01:19,599 --> 02:01:25,199
people in opposition to elites. It's why

3037
02:01:23,199 --> 02:01:27,760
a lot of American politicians put on

3038
02:01:25,199 --> 02:01:29,679
this folksy charade. You know what I'm

3039
02:01:27,760 --> 02:01:32,880
talking about. I grew up in a small

3040
02:01:29,679 --> 02:01:35,119
town. I work in a farm factory. I piss

3041
02:01:32,880 --> 02:01:38,639
in a bucket. I grew up castrating hogs

3042
02:01:35,119 --> 02:01:40,880
on an Iowa farm. Just ask the single mom

3043
02:01:38,639 --> 02:01:43,599
from Swing State who sits around the

3044
02:01:40,880 --> 02:01:46,960
kitchen table every night castrating

3045
02:01:43,599 --> 02:01:50,159
hogs or whatever it is you people do.

3046
02:01:46,960 --> 02:01:51,599
Are you a racist? Do you hate Mexicans?

3047
02:01:50,159 --> 02:01:53,280
I mean, I guess it works or they

3048
02:01:51,599 --> 02:01:54,679
wouldn't do it. Everyone wants to brand

3049
02:01:53,280 --> 02:01:56,960
themselves as

3050
02:01:54,679 --> 02:02:00,000
anti-establishment. The problem though

3051
02:01:56,960 --> 02:02:03,199
is anti-establishment is not in and of

3052
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:05,520
itself an actual political agenda as any

3053
02:02:03,199 --> 02:02:07,400
successful revolutionary will tell you

3054
02:02:05,520 --> 02:02:10,599
because what happens after the

3055
02:02:07,400 --> 02:02:13,000
revolution. You have to create a new

3056
02:02:10,599 --> 02:02:15,280
establishment and then all your

3057
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:17,599
anti-establishment rhetoric gets a

3058
02:02:15,280 --> 02:02:20,159
little awkward. It's a problem Mao

3059
02:02:17,599 --> 02:02:23,280
solved with the ingeniously Mchavelian

3060
02:02:20,159 --> 02:02:24,639
idea of a second revolution. Now, if you

3061
02:02:23,280 --> 02:02:26,960
don't know what kind of establishment

3062
02:02:24,639 --> 02:02:28,960
you want and don't have a realistic plan

3063
02:02:26,960 --> 02:02:31,040
for how to get it, well, then you're

3064
02:02:28,960 --> 02:02:33,040
just a complainer like George Carlin,

3065
02:02:31,040 --> 02:02:35,520
who was influenced by leftist but whose

3066
02:02:33,040 --> 02:02:38,560
politics was basically defeist. It will

3067
02:02:35,520 --> 02:02:40,159
never ever ever be fixed. It's never

3068
02:02:38,560 --> 02:02:42,239
going to get any better. Don't look for

3069
02:02:40,159 --> 02:02:44,159
it. Be happy with what you got. Don't

3070
02:02:42,239 --> 02:02:46,800
vote. Don't revolt. Don't expect things

3071
02:02:44,159 --> 02:02:50,000
to get better. The system's rigged. Just

3072
02:02:46,800 --> 02:02:51,599
sit back and laugh. And I get that. I'm

3073
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:53,840
something of a professional complainer

3074
02:02:51,599 --> 02:02:55,840
myself. But the problem is, while we are

3075
02:02:53,840 --> 02:02:58,320
sitting back and laughing, people with

3076
02:02:55,840 --> 02:03:00,719
an agenda are getting things done. A

3077
02:02:58,320 --> 02:03:04,239
populist agenda is defined by where the

3078
02:03:00,719 --> 02:03:07,760
line is drawn between us and them. Who

3079
02:03:04,239 --> 02:03:10,480
are the people and who are the elites?

3080
02:03:07,760 --> 02:03:12,159
What is the big club that you ain't in?

3081
02:03:10,480 --> 02:03:14,560
And this is a matter of life and death,

3082
02:03:12,159 --> 02:03:17,040
so you better get this right. Populism

3083
02:03:14,560 --> 02:03:19,599
escalates into violence when tensions in

3084
02:03:17,040 --> 02:03:21,760
society reach a breaking point. Always a

3085
02:03:19,599 --> 02:03:23,920
risk in a culture lacking an established

3086
02:03:21,760 --> 02:03:26,800
ritual of sending a sin-laden goat out

3087
02:03:23,920 --> 02:03:29,520
into the desert once a year. Now, I'm a

3088
02:03:26,800 --> 02:03:31,360
liberal social democrat. I'd prefer to

3089
02:03:29,520 --> 02:03:34,880
improve society through democratic

3090
02:03:31,360 --> 02:03:37,119
reforms, but I'm aware my libk opinions

3091
02:03:34,880 --> 02:03:39,280
are not popular at the moment because

3092
02:03:37,119 --> 02:03:41,840
the right doesn't want reform. They want

3093
02:03:39,280 --> 02:03:44,239
to punish minorities and the left

3094
02:03:41,840 --> 02:03:45,840
doesn't want to vote. I was going to say

3095
02:03:44,239 --> 02:03:47,920
they want to smash, but they don't even

3096
02:03:45,840 --> 02:03:50,320
want to do that. They want to theorize

3097
02:03:47,920 --> 02:03:52,800
the inevitability of smashing, as

3098
02:03:50,320 --> 02:03:55,119
they've been doing for almost two

3099
02:03:52,800 --> 02:03:57,599
centuries now. So, one way or another,

3100
02:03:55,119 --> 02:04:00,159
the people are out for blood. The

3101
02:03:57,599 --> 02:04:03,040
question is, whose blood's it going to

3102
02:04:00,159 --> 02:04:05,440
be this time? I'm sure CEOs are a little

3103
02:04:03,040 --> 02:04:07,920
nervous right now, but probably not that

3104
02:04:05,440 --> 02:04:10,320
nervous. There's reliable ways to escape

3105
02:04:07,920 --> 02:04:12,560
the guillotine. Socialism always has to

3106
02:04:10,320 --> 02:04:15,679
compete with nationalism to channel

3107
02:04:12,560 --> 02:04:17,760
populist resentment. And socialism has a

3108
02:04:15,679 --> 02:04:20,080
critical weakness, which is that it's

3109
02:04:17,760 --> 02:04:22,119
just a little too intellectual.

3110
02:04:20,080 --> 02:04:24,239
Socialists try to create class

3111
02:04:22,119 --> 02:04:27,119
consciousness. That is, they tried to

3112
02:04:24,239 --> 02:04:30,239
build a workingclass we opposed to a

3113
02:04:27,119 --> 02:04:32,320
capitalist they. Marxist theory is not

3114
02:04:30,239 --> 02:04:34,960
conspiracist because the line between

3115
02:04:32,320 --> 02:04:37,920
workingclass and capitalist is defined

3116
02:04:34,960 --> 02:04:39,599
by an economic relation, not by

3117
02:04:37,920 --> 02:04:41,440
inclusion or exclusion from a

3118
02:04:39,599 --> 02:04:43,440
conspiracy. But that's a subtle

3119
02:04:41,440 --> 02:04:45,760
distinction that's hard to communicate

3120
02:04:43,440 --> 02:04:49,040
to normal people. And if you use weird

3121
02:04:45,760 --> 02:04:51,440
jargon like bgeoa and dialectic, you

3122
02:04:49,040 --> 02:04:53,760
sound like a creepy ideologue. So

3123
02:04:51,440 --> 02:04:56,880
popular socialists like Bernie Sanders

3124
02:04:53,760 --> 02:05:00,639
or sort of George Carlin don't say those

3125
02:04:56,880 --> 02:05:02,960
words. They say the 1%. They say it's a

3126
02:05:00,639 --> 02:05:04,719
big club and you ain't in it. That

3127
02:05:02,960 --> 02:05:07,360
language emotionally resonates with

3128
02:05:04,719 --> 02:05:09,440
people, but the subtlety is lost in

3129
02:05:07,360 --> 02:05:12,360
translation. Most people find

3130
02:05:09,440 --> 02:05:13,960
conspiracism more intuitive than

3131
02:05:12,360 --> 02:05:16,560
dialectical

3132
02:05:13,960 --> 02:05:18,800
materialism. Lord have mercy. Just

3133
02:05:16,560 --> 02:05:21,199
explain to Joe Rogan that it's simply a

3134
02:05:18,800 --> 02:05:22,599
non idealist in version of Hegelianism.

3135
02:05:21,199 --> 02:05:25,360
How difficult is that? For

3136
02:05:22,599 --> 02:05:28,159
conspiracists, the belief in a they

3137
02:05:25,360 --> 02:05:30,639
creates a wei. The line between us and

3138
02:05:28,159 --> 02:05:34,719
them is not based on class. It's based

3139
02:05:30,639 --> 02:05:38,000
on the conspiracy. They, the insiders,

3140
02:05:34,719 --> 02:05:40,320
are in on it. We, the outsiders, are

3141
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:42,560
not. Conspiracist Gary Allen says,

3142
02:05:40,320 --> 02:05:43,920
"Unless you are an insider, you are a

3143
02:05:42,560 --> 02:05:45,760
victim. Whether you are a

3144
02:05:43,920 --> 02:05:47,840
multi-millionaire or a popper, you have

3145
02:05:45,760 --> 02:05:50,320
an enormous amount at stake." So

3146
02:05:47,840 --> 02:05:53,040
conspiracism potentially unites everyone

3147
02:05:50,320 --> 02:05:57,040
from billionaires to the unemployed in a

3148
02:05:53,040 --> 02:05:59,840
single we against the cabal, the deep

3149
02:05:57,040 --> 02:06:01,880
state, the globalists, the international

3150
02:05:59,840 --> 02:06:03,920
bankers, the radical left, the

3151
02:06:01,880 --> 02:06:05,760
reptilians. Just pick a convenient

3152
02:06:03,920 --> 02:06:08,000
scapegoat. Who cares, right? It's

3153
02:06:05,760 --> 02:06:10,400
conspiracism. Facts don't matter. This

3154
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:13,199
makes conspiracism a billionaire's best

3155
02:06:10,400 --> 02:06:15,599
friend. At least a gentile billionaire.

3156
02:06:13,199 --> 02:06:18,080
It's how real estate mogul Donald Trump

3157
02:06:15,599 --> 02:06:20,639
and world's richest tech oligarch Elon

3158
02:06:18,080 --> 02:06:22,960
Musk were able to convince the people

3159
02:06:20,639 --> 02:06:26,320
that they, like us, are somehow

3160
02:06:22,960 --> 02:06:29,520
outsiders to the establishment elite.

3161
02:06:26,320 --> 02:06:34,639
Because when they say the elite, they

3162
02:06:29,520 --> 02:06:37,360
mean the woke elite, the DEI elite. They

3163
02:06:34,639 --> 02:06:40,000
mean minorities. For nationalists like

3164
02:06:37,360 --> 02:06:42,800
Trump, conspiracism is not just useful,

3165
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:45,840
it's essential. Nationalism constructs a

3166
02:06:42,800 --> 02:06:49,040
native, ethnic, or racial we opposed to

3167
02:06:45,840 --> 02:06:51,280
a foreign, invasive, or degenerate they.

3168
02:06:49,040 --> 02:06:53,840
The populist version of nationalism,

3169
02:06:51,280 --> 02:06:56,239
national socialism, if you will, is the

3170
02:06:53,840 --> 02:06:59,119
idea that the native, ethnic, or racial

3171
02:06:56,239 --> 02:07:02,079
common people are opposed by a foreign,

3172
02:06:59,119 --> 02:07:03,920
invasive, or degenerate elite. And in a

3173
02:07:02,079 --> 02:07:06,159
country that's not literally ruled by a

3174
02:07:03,920 --> 02:07:08,320
foreign colonial power, the only way to

3175
02:07:06,159 --> 02:07:10,719
support that idea is with conspiracy

3176
02:07:08,320 --> 02:07:13,119
theories. So, now is probably the time

3177
02:07:10,719 --> 02:07:15,280
to unpin the anti-semitism discussion

3178
02:07:13,119 --> 02:07:17,280
that I've been pinning this whole video.

3179
02:07:15,280 --> 02:07:18,960
I put it off to avoid a comment section

3180
02:07:17,280 --> 02:07:21,199
overly choked with claims that

3181
02:07:18,960 --> 02:07:23,679
anti-semite is a slur designed to

3182
02:07:21,199 --> 02:07:26,079
silence truth seekers. Another favorite

3183
02:07:23,679 --> 02:07:28,800
conspiracist slogan goes, "To learn who

3184
02:07:26,079 --> 02:07:32,560
rules over you, simply find out who you

3185
02:07:28,800 --> 02:07:36,159
are not allowed to criticize."

02:07:32,560 --> 02:07:38,400

banking family, but you know, good luck

explaining that to the There are no

3190
02:07:42,719 --> 02:07:47,119
coincidences brigade. Mike Rothschild

3191
02:07:45,040 --> 02:07:49,199
says, quote, "Almost all conspiracy

3192
02:07:47,119 --> 02:07:51,360
theories are rooted in anti-semitism,

3193
02:07:49,199 --> 02:07:53,599
and almost all anti-semitism is rooted

3194
02:07:51,360 --> 02:07:55,480
in conspiracy theories." For research on

3195
02:07:53,599 --> 02:07:58,639
this video, I made an alt account on

3196
02:07:55,480 --> 02:08:01,440
x.com and even I was surprised by just

3197
02:07:58,639 --> 02:08:03,840
how fast the app pipelined me straight

3198
02:08:01,440 --> 02:08:05,679
to Hitler. And when I say Hitler, I

3199
02:08:03,840 --> 02:08:08,960
don't mean Hitler as matonomy for

3200
02:08:05,679 --> 02:08:11,760
bigotry in general. I mean Adolf Hitler,

3201
02:08:08,960 --> 02:08:14,000
Reich Chancellor of Germany from 1933

3202
02:08:11,760 --> 02:08:16,400
until the bullet hit his brain. Hitler

3203
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:18,960
came to power and within 6 years,

3204
02:08:16,400 --> 02:08:20,800
Germany became the wealthiest economy in

3205
02:08:18,960 --> 02:08:22,960
the world. How did this happen? and

3206
02:08:20,800 --> 02:08:25,360
brother Joshua. Don't even trip. I got

3207
02:08:22,960 --> 02:08:27,440
you. Hitler implemented two laws to make

3208
02:08:25,360 --> 02:08:29,360
this happen. I could tell you about him

3209
02:08:27,440 --> 02:08:32,000
personally, but I'd rather have a Jewish

3210
02:08:29,360 --> 02:08:34,239
rabbi prove my point. If you think about

3211
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:37,239
it, doesn't disagreeing with the pro-

3212
02:08:34,239 --> 02:08:39,920
Hitler rabbi make you the real

3213
02:08:37,239 --> 02:08:43,920
anti-Semite. Andrew Tate finally said,

3214
02:08:39,920 --> 02:08:46,079
"The Matrix is the Jews thread." Did you

3215
02:08:43,920 --> 02:08:48,560
know Kim Jong-un and his family are

3216
02:08:46,079 --> 02:08:50,639
Jewish? Oh, look. Passionate graphic

3217
02:08:48,560 --> 02:08:52,880
designer Dylan Lewis Monroe made a

3218
02:08:50,639 --> 02:08:55,679
sharable social media friendly summary

3219
02:08:52,880 --> 02:08:57,599
of the protocols of the Elders of Zion.

3220
02:08:55,679 --> 02:08:59,520
Convenient. These are some of the less

3221
02:08:57,599 --> 02:09:01,199
offensive posts. I can't even show you

3222
02:08:59,520 --> 02:09:03,280
most of it. While I was working on this

3223
02:09:01,199 --> 02:09:05,079
video, I went to a European war museum

3224
02:09:03,280 --> 02:09:07,520
that had a bunch of historic Nazi

3225
02:09:05,079 --> 02:09:09,280
propaganda. And honestly, some of the

3226
02:09:07,520 --> 02:09:11,119
stuff I was seeing on Twitter was

3227
02:09:09,280 --> 02:09:13,760
actually worse. If you don't believe me,

3228
02:09:11,119 --> 02:09:16,159
I did screenshot evidence. There is so

3229
02:09:13,760 --> 02:09:18,719
much Nazi propaganda on my phone. Yeah,

3230
02:09:16,159 --> 02:09:20,400
it's mostly Nazi propaganda. Oh, that

3231
02:09:18,719 --> 02:09:22,079
was a nice dinner. Conspiracists are

3232
02:09:20,400 --> 02:09:24,159
constantly bickering among themselves

3233
02:09:22,079 --> 02:09:26,079
about the answer to the question, who is

3234
02:09:24,159 --> 02:09:28,800
they? with many preferring elaborate

3235
02:09:26,079 --> 02:09:32,079
euphemisms like globalists, elitists,

3236
02:09:28,800 --> 02:09:34,480
frankists, sabotans, communists, deep

3237
02:09:32,079 --> 02:09:36,719
state, Zionists, oligarchists,

3238
02:09:34,480 --> 02:09:39,040
Rothschild bankers. And if you call out

3239
02:09:36,719 --> 02:09:41,599
the euphemisms, the conspiracist says,

3240
02:09:39,040 --> 02:09:43,520
"Wow, did you just assume I was talking

3241
02:09:41,599 --> 02:09:46,239
about all Jews when I said the deep

3242
02:09:43,520 --> 02:09:49,119
state Rothschild Frankists?" Doesn't

3243
02:09:46,239 --> 02:09:50,800
that make you the real anti-semite? But

3244
02:09:49,119 --> 02:09:52,800
now that hate speech restrictions are

3245
02:09:50,800 --> 02:09:54,480
being lifted on many platforms, a lot of

3246
02:09:52,800 --> 02:09:57,679
them have started encouraging each other

3247
02:09:54,480 --> 02:09:59,679
to just say Jews. Now, it has to be said

3248
02:09:57,679 --> 02:10:02,159
that a lot of these people are using

3249
02:09:59,679 --> 02:10:05,440
Israel's crimes against Palestine as a

3250
02:10:02,159 --> 02:10:07,280
pretext, and those crimes are real, and

3251
02:10:05,440 --> 02:10:09,199
the Trump administration really is

3252
02:10:07,280 --> 02:10:11,679
citing anti-semitism to justify

3253
02:10:09,199 --> 02:10:13,280
crackdowns on protests and universities.

3254
02:10:11,679 --> 02:10:14,800
But it certainly doesn't help that

3255
02:10:13,280 --> 02:10:17,119
conspiracists are exploiting the

3256
02:10:14,800 --> 02:10:20,400
situation to promote Hitilarian Jew

3257
02:10:17,119 --> 02:10:22,800
hatred. So, why is conspiracism a funnel

3258
02:10:20,400 --> 02:10:25,760
that leads to Hitler? Well, a bunch of

3259
02:10:22,800 --> 02:10:27,280
reasons. One, Hitler was a conspiracy

3260
02:10:25,760 --> 02:10:30,400
theorist. People don't usually

3261
02:10:27,280 --> 02:10:32,560
categorize him that way, but he was. My

3262
02:10:30,400 --> 02:10:35,280
struggle is full of ramblings about how

3263
02:10:32,560 --> 02:10:36,560
like the Jews control the Freemasons and

3264
02:10:35,280 --> 02:10:39,119
they're going to make us all speak

3265
02:10:36,560 --> 02:10:41,440
aspirto. I assume conspiracists must

3266
02:10:39,119 --> 02:10:43,760
find this relatable. Just kidding. They

3267
02:10:41,440 --> 02:10:47,280
don't read. Kids these days can't even

3268
02:10:43,760 --> 02:10:49,599
be bothered to read mine comp. Sad. Two,

3269
02:10:47,280 --> 02:10:51,760
conspiracism is about scapegoating. And

3270
02:10:49,599 --> 02:10:54,159
in Western culture, Jews are a

3271
02:10:51,760 --> 02:10:57,199
traditional scapegoat. The Jews stole

3272
02:10:54,159 --> 02:10:59,599
this from you. Israel took this from us.

3273
02:10:57,199 --> 02:11:02,560
No, our beautiful dead wife, he was

3274
02:10:59,599 --> 02:11:04,599
taken by Israel. Okasan, the Jews are to

3275
02:11:02,560 --> 02:11:07,280
blame for my attraction to

3276
02:11:04,599 --> 02:11:10,320
minors. Now that is how you escape a

3277
02:11:07,280 --> 02:11:12,079
goat. Three, Jews are associated with a

3278
02:11:10,320 --> 02:11:14,239
bunch of other things conspiracists are

3279
02:11:12,079 --> 02:11:16,800
obsessed with, like Hollywood and

3280
02:11:14,239 --> 02:11:19,360
finance. Nationalist conspiracism needs

3281
02:11:16,800 --> 02:11:21,360
to identify an out group as the elite.

3282
02:11:19,360 --> 02:11:23,440
And it's especially the association with

3283
02:11:21,360 --> 02:11:25,440
money that makes Jews the favorite

3284
02:11:23,440 --> 02:11:28,880
target because the world revolves around

3285
02:11:25,440 --> 02:11:31,199
money and money is mysterious. Who

3286
02:11:28,880 --> 02:11:33,119
controls the money? The association

3287
02:11:31,199 --> 02:11:34,880
between Jews and finance began in

3288
02:11:33,119 --> 02:11:36,880
medieval Europe where Jews were

3289
02:11:34,880 --> 02:11:39,360
second-ass citizens prohibited from

3290
02:11:36,880 --> 02:11:41,360
practicing most trades. One exception

3291
02:11:39,360 --> 02:11:42,960
was money lending which Christians

3292
02:11:41,360 --> 02:11:45,679
couldn't practice because the church

3293
02:11:42,960 --> 02:11:48,159
condemned userie. So monarchs and nobles

3294
02:11:45,679 --> 02:11:50,880
would hire a so-called court Jew to

3295
02:11:48,159 --> 02:11:53,599
handle their finances. Most famously

3296
02:11:50,880 --> 02:11:55,679
Meer Amchel Rothschilds who rose from a

3297
02:11:53,599 --> 02:11:57,679
Jewish ghetto in Frankfurt and whose

3298
02:11:55,679 --> 02:12:00,079
five sons started businesses across

3299
02:11:57,679 --> 02:12:02,719
Europe creating a banking dynasty that

3300
02:12:00,079 --> 02:12:05,199
in the 19th century made the Rothschilds

3301
02:12:02,719 --> 02:12:07,679
the richest private family in the world.

3302
02:12:05,199 --> 02:12:10,400
So there is some grain of truth here,

3303
02:12:07,679 --> 02:12:12,639
but as usual it does not correspond to

3304
02:12:10,400 --> 02:12:14,320
the things conspiracists are saying. The

3305
02:12:12,639 --> 02:12:16,239
Rothschilds do not control every

3306
02:12:14,320 --> 02:12:17,920
country's central bank. They do not own

3307
02:12:16,239 --> 02:12:19,599
the government and media. They have

3308
02:12:17,920 --> 02:12:23,320
nowhere near the influence of today's

3309
02:12:19,599 --> 02:12:25,440
top oligarchs. And no, they do not eat

3310
02:12:23,320 --> 02:12:28,079
babies. A lot of people feel that

3311
02:12:25,440 --> 02:12:31,440
there's something occult and unnatural

3312
02:12:28,079 --> 02:12:33,920
about finance itself. It's making money

3313
02:12:31,440 --> 02:12:36,480
from money, which seems like evil

3314
02:12:33,920 --> 02:12:38,159
alchemy, black magic. And this should

3315
02:12:36,480 --> 02:12:40,719
not be conflated with reasonable

3316
02:12:38,159 --> 02:12:43,440
criticism of finance capitalism. The

3317
02:12:40,719 --> 02:12:45,360
conspiracist accusation is of witchery

3318
02:12:43,440 --> 02:12:47,679
and that the Rothschilds intentionally

3319
02:12:45,360 --> 02:12:49,920
sunk the Titanic to create the Federal

3320
02:12:47,679 --> 02:12:51,760
Reserve in a secret meeting on Jackal

3321
02:12:49,920 --> 02:12:55,199
Island, which may or may not have been

3322
02:12:51,760 --> 02:12:57,520
attended by Satan himself, and so on.

3323
02:12:55,199 --> 02:12:59,920
There's a saying that anti-semitism is

3324
02:12:57,520 --> 02:13:01,760
the socialism of fools. It appeals to

3325
02:12:59,920 --> 02:13:04,000
people who sense that something is wrong

3326
02:13:01,760 --> 02:13:06,400
with our economy, that money is somehow

3327
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:07,760
corrupting politics in media, but they

3328
02:13:06,400 --> 02:13:10,000
don't know enough about any of those

3329
02:13:07,760 --> 02:13:12,639
things to criticize it intelligently.

3330
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:14,719
Nationalists object to the elite, not

3331
02:13:12,639 --> 02:13:17,599
just as a power over us, but as a

3332
02:13:14,719 --> 02:13:20,159
foreign power over us. Their complaint

3333
02:13:17,599 --> 02:13:23,040
is that the elite are not people like

3334
02:13:20,159 --> 02:13:25,599
us. Socialist intellectuals tend to be

3335
02:13:23,040 --> 02:13:28,320
very optimistic about transcending gut

3336
02:13:25,599 --> 02:13:30,800
level blood and soil nationalism by

3337
02:13:28,320 --> 02:13:33,679
redirecting attention to intellectual

3338
02:13:30,800 --> 02:13:36,880
class analysis. But anti-semitism is the

3339
02:13:33,679 --> 02:13:40,320
socialism of fools and there's a lot of

3340
02:13:36,880 --> 02:13:42,880
fools. Leftism unfortunately does not

3341
02:13:40,320 --> 02:13:45,280
inoculate people against foolishness.

3342
02:13:42,880 --> 02:13:48,560
Socialist revolutions are always at risk

3343
02:13:45,280 --> 02:13:51,199
of turning nationalist. Stalin diverged

3344
02:13:48,560 --> 02:13:53,520
from Marx, declaring socialism in one

3345
02:13:51,199 --> 02:13:55,840
country. And despite his role in

3346
02:13:53,520 --> 02:13:58,079
defeating Hitler, he eventually went on

3347
02:13:55,840 --> 02:14:01,920
to carry out his own little purge of

3348
02:13:58,079 --> 02:14:04,400
rootless cosmopolitans. That is Jews.

3349
02:14:01,920 --> 02:14:08,239
Fools of the world unite. In a video I

3350
02:14:04,400 --> 02:14:08,239
made years ago about Hold

3351
02:14:13,560 --> 02:14:18,800
on, capitalism. I suggested that David

3352
02:14:16,639 --> 02:14:20,480
Ike's reptilians could be ironically

3353
02:14:18,800 --> 02:14:22,719
appropriated as a metaphor for the

3354
02:14:20,480 --> 02:14:25,560
ruling class, like in the movie They

3355
02:14:22,719 --> 02:14:28,560
Live. Some people criticize this as

3356
02:14:25,560 --> 02:14:31,040
anti-Semitic. And I've come to basically

3357
02:14:28,560 --> 02:14:33,239
agree with that criticism. To be clear,

3358
02:14:31,040 --> 02:14:35,840
David Ike believes in literal

3359
02:14:33,239 --> 02:14:38,400
extraterrestrial reptilians. It's not

3360
02:14:35,840 --> 02:14:40,960
intended as a metaphor, though Ike does

3361
02:14:38,400 --> 02:14:43,199
say anti-Semitic stuff all the time. I

3362
02:14:40,960 --> 02:14:46,480
mean, he says Hitler was a Rothschild.

3363
02:14:43,199 --> 02:14:50,000
See appendix 2. Hitler was a Rothschild.

3364
02:14:46,480 --> 02:14:52,840
But reptilian overlords as a metaphor

3365
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:55,280
imply elites who are alien, who are

3366
02:14:52,840 --> 02:14:57,679
outsiders, and that makes the metaphor

3367
02:14:55,280 --> 02:15:00,480
inherently suggestive of conspiracist

3368
02:14:57,679 --> 02:15:02,800
bigotry. Anti-semitism is the archetype

3369
02:15:00,480 --> 02:15:05,360
of this kind of bigotry. Though Jews are

3370
02:15:02,800 --> 02:15:07,520
by no means the only targets, LGBT

3371
02:15:05,360 --> 02:15:10,520
people are likewise often accused of

3372
02:15:07,520 --> 02:15:12,480
wielding a powerful agenda due to the

3373
02:15:10,520 --> 02:15:14,880
disproportionate prevalence of gay

3374
02:15:12,480 --> 02:15:17,679
people in arts and entertainment. Again,

3375
02:15:14,880 --> 02:15:19,920
grain of truth, but it's due largely to

3376
02:15:17,679 --> 02:15:22,000
discrimination in most other industries

3377
02:15:19,920 --> 02:15:24,480
and not due to a conspiracy.

3378
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:27,040
Conspiracists invoke queercoded villain

3379
02:15:24,480 --> 02:15:29,119
in media like the capital dandies in the

3380
02:15:27,040 --> 02:15:31,920
Hunger Games to insinuate that the

3381
02:15:29,119 --> 02:15:34,000
establishment elites are gay. This has

3382
02:15:31,920 --> 02:15:35,760
nothing to do with any kind of Marxist

3383
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:38,639
intellectualizing about material

3384
02:15:35,760 --> 02:15:40,960
conditions. Populist bigots don't want

3385
02:15:38,639 --> 02:15:43,520
equality. They want to be ruled by

3386
02:15:40,960 --> 02:15:46,400
people they identify with, by people

3387
02:15:43,520 --> 02:15:48,960
like them. Hatred of an outsider unites

3388
02:15:46,400 --> 02:15:51,440
people across economic classes in the

3389
02:15:48,960 --> 02:15:53,280
shared community of a lynch mob. So

3390
02:15:51,440 --> 02:15:55,840
bigotry in general is useful to

3391
02:15:53,280 --> 02:15:58,159
politicians, but conspiracist bigotry is

3392
02:15:55,840 --> 02:16:00,719
particularly useful because it empowers

3393
02:15:58,159 --> 02:16:03,199
them to continue railing against the

3394
02:16:00,719 --> 02:16:05,920
establishment elite, the source of all

3395
02:16:03,199 --> 02:16:08,159
our problems, even after they've

3396
02:16:05,920 --> 02:16:10,639
ascended to the throne. Richard Nixon,

3397
02:16:08,159 --> 02:16:13,199
when he was literally the president, was

3398
02:16:10,639 --> 02:16:16,079
endlessly conspiracist about the liberal

3399
02:16:13,199 --> 02:16:18,480
establishment. The press is the enemy.

3400
02:16:16,079 --> 02:16:21,360
The establishment is the enemy. The

3401
02:16:18,480 --> 02:16:23,199
professors are the enemy. It's ironic

3402
02:16:21,360 --> 02:16:25,199
considering Nixon perpetrated the most

3403
02:16:23,199 --> 02:16:27,520
famous real conspiracy in American

3404
02:16:25,199 --> 02:16:30,239
history, but I actually don't think

3405
02:16:27,520 --> 02:16:32,559
that's an accident. I think conspiracist

3406
02:16:30,239 --> 02:16:35,519
politicians are actually more likely to

3407
02:16:32,559 --> 02:16:37,840
perpetrate actual conspiracies because

3408
02:16:35,519 --> 02:16:40,000
their belief in a conspiracy or their

3409
02:16:37,840 --> 02:16:43,359
followers belief in a conspiracy

3410
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:45,760
justifies plotting a counter conspiracy.

3411
02:16:43,359 --> 02:16:47,439
Donald Trump really did conspire to

3412
02:16:45,760 --> 02:16:50,479
overturn the results of the 2020

3413
02:16:47,439 --> 02:16:52,800
election. Stop the steel was a counter

3414
02:16:50,479 --> 02:16:55,679
conspiracy which people supported on the

3415
02:16:52,800 --> 02:16:58,000
basis of a false conspiracy theory that

3416
02:16:55,679 --> 02:17:00,319
Biden stole the election. And now with

3417
02:16:58,000 --> 02:17:02,479
Trump in power once again, do we expect

3418
02:17:00,319 --> 02:17:06,319
the right to turn on him when things do

3419
02:17:02,479 --> 02:17:08,639
not go well? No, of course not. They'll

3420
02:17:06,319 --> 02:17:11,040
keep digging into further layers of the

3421
02:17:08,639 --> 02:17:13,679
deep state, looking for new scapegoats

3422
02:17:11,040 --> 02:17:16,240
and new conspiracies to externalize the

3423
02:17:13,679 --> 02:17:18,960
blame. That is until this wave of

3424
02:17:16,240 --> 02:17:20,880
fascism crashes and recedes and then

3425
02:17:18,960 --> 02:17:22,880
suddenly they'll deny they ever

3426
02:17:20,880 --> 02:17:25,519
supported Trump. Or they'll claim the

3427
02:17:22,880 --> 02:17:28,160
Illuminati made them do it. That Trump

3428
02:17:25,519 --> 02:17:30,960
was a Roth's child. No responsibility

3429
02:17:28,160 --> 02:17:32,880
will be taken. Nothing will be learned.

3430
02:17:30,960 --> 02:17:35,280
You know, I've often thought that if you

3431
02:17:32,880 --> 02:17:37,920
simply translated Hitler's speeches into

3432
02:17:35,280 --> 02:17:40,319
English and updated a few details that

3433
02:17:37,920 --> 02:17:42,399
Americans would completely buy it. A few

3434
02:17:40,319 --> 02:17:45,040
months ago, that thought was proven

3435
02:17:42,399 --> 02:17:47,280
right. Hitler's AI translated speeches

3436
02:17:45,040 --> 02:17:49,519
go viral on Tik Tok with one video

3437
02:17:47,280 --> 02:17:51,280
topping 1 million views in troubling

3438
02:17:49,519 --> 02:17:53,920
trend. Is this what you thought the

3439
02:17:51,280 --> 02:17:55,599
future would be? Using AI to bring

3440
02:17:53,920 --> 02:17:57,679
Hitler back? I'm sure they're being

3441
02:17:55,599 --> 02:18:00,800
normal about this over on the conspiracy

3442
02:17:57,679 --> 02:18:02,960
subreddit. Let's take a look. Hitler may

3443
02:18:00,800 --> 02:18:06,880
not have been what we've been told he

3444
02:18:02,960 --> 02:18:09,280
was. Here we go. This is a AI translated

3445
02:18:06,880 --> 02:18:11,760
speech by Hitler where I expected to

3446
02:18:09,280 --> 02:18:14,319
hear him babble incoherence, but he was

3447
02:18:11,760 --> 02:18:16,559
actually spoton about a lot of issues.

3448
02:18:14,319 --> 02:18:19,200
He calls out the elite banking class,

3449
02:18:16,559 --> 02:18:21,840
the stock market, the elucory two-party

3450
02:18:19,200 --> 02:18:23,840
system, the globalists, an outsider

3451
02:18:21,840 --> 02:18:26,880
minority forming a nation within a

3452
02:18:23,840 --> 02:18:29,040
nation, hyperinflation, etc. blamed the

3453
02:18:26,880 --> 02:18:31,679
Jews for everything. The poster then

3454
02:18:29,040 --> 02:18:33,840
pastes what appears to be a chat GPT

3455
02:18:31,679 --> 02:18:36,319
summary of conspiracy theories Hitler

3456
02:18:33,840 --> 02:18:39,439
believed and then declares promoting

3457
02:18:36,319 --> 02:18:41,679
communist ideals, degenerate ideals,

3458
02:18:39,439 --> 02:18:44,639
liberal ideals about sexuality and

3459
02:18:41,679 --> 02:18:47,040
gender roles, undermining Christianity.

3460
02:18:44,639 --> 02:18:49,359
Guys, it's the same [ __ ] happening

3461
02:18:47,040 --> 02:18:51,479
today. The post concludes by pointing

3462
02:18:49,359 --> 02:18:53,960
out that Nazis burned books about

3463
02:18:51,479 --> 02:18:59,359
transsexualism and therefore that Hitler

3464
02:18:53,960 --> 02:19:01,290
was, dare I say it, based I think we all

3465
02:18:59,359 --> 02:19:03,319
owe Hitler an

3466
02:19:01,290 --> 02:19:06,160
[Music]

3467
02:19:03,319 --> 02:19:08,880
apology, guys. I started out this video

3468
02:19:06,160 --> 02:19:12,319
trying to be nice, but this post has

3469
02:19:08,880 --> 02:19:13,639
spent the last of my patience. It's just

3470
02:19:12,319 --> 02:19:18,000
so

3471
02:19:13,639 --> 02:19:19,760
stupid. How can you be this stupid? I'm

3472
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:21,679
not asking you to be an intellectual.

3473
02:19:19,760 --> 02:19:23,920
I'm not asking you to write a thesis on

3474
02:19:21,679 --> 02:19:27,439
[ __ ] Vickenstein. I'm asking you to

3475
02:19:23,920 --> 02:19:31,599
be 10% smarter than the absolute dumbest

3476
02:19:27,439 --> 02:19:34,000
it is possible for a human to be. It

3477
02:19:31,599 --> 02:19:36,960
boggles my mind how susceptible to

3478
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:38,800
propaganda you are. It's not like

3479
02:19:36,960 --> 02:19:40,319
someone tricked you by giving you a

3480
02:19:38,800 --> 02:19:43,679
transcript without telling you who wrote

3481
02:19:40,319 --> 02:19:46,399
it. They told you it was Hitler. And

3482
02:19:43,679 --> 02:19:48,520
when you agreed with it anyway, did you

3483
02:19:46,399 --> 02:19:51,040
question your own

3484
02:19:48,520 --> 02:19:53,760
judgment? No.

3485
02:19:51,040 --> 02:19:57,200
The first thought through that infinite

3486
02:19:53,760 --> 02:20:01,120
decimally tiny brain of yours was that

3487
02:19:57,200 --> 02:20:03,240
the mainstream media has lied to us

3488
02:20:01,120 --> 02:20:05,920
about

3489
02:20:03,240 --> 02:20:09,200
Hitler. There's a reason they only let

3490
02:20:05,920 --> 02:20:09,200
us see him speaking

3491
02:20:09,240 --> 02:20:16,800
German. I honestly can't believe it. I

3492
02:20:13,520 --> 02:20:21,760
cannot believe how god damn dumb you

3493
02:20:16,800 --> 02:20:23,240
are. It is actually astounding.

3494
02:20:21,760 --> 02:20:26,399
Mom needs a

3495
02:20:23,240 --> 02:20:30,520
Xanax. Part six. I can't think of a

3496
02:20:26,399 --> 02:20:32,880
section for this title. Doctor, I'm too

3497
02:20:30,520 --> 02:20:35,280
depressed. This isn't very low

3498
02:20:32,880 --> 02:20:37,920
vibrational crochet I'm doing here. What

3499
02:20:35,280 --> 02:20:40,880
am I even making? Like a pot holder for

3500
02:20:37,920 --> 02:20:43,040
deformed pots. I am weaving a web of

3501
02:20:40,880 --> 02:20:45,120
truth. Okay, I don't want to hear any

3502
02:20:43,040 --> 02:20:47,040
crap about it in the comments. So, I

3503
02:20:45,120 --> 02:20:49,359
suspect the main criticism of this video

3504
02:20:47,040 --> 02:20:52,240
from conspiracists will be that I didn't

3505
02:20:49,359 --> 02:20:53,920
debunk anything. And that's true. My

3506
02:20:52,240 --> 02:20:57,280
goal has been to analyze a way of

3507
02:20:53,920 --> 02:20:59,760
thinking, not to, you know, litigate the

3508
02:20:57,280 --> 02:21:01,600
evidence of JFK Jr. living in secret

3509
02:20:59,760 --> 02:21:03,280
tunnels beneath Denver International

3510
02:21:01,600 --> 02:21:04,720
Airport. I don't know what he's doing

3511
02:21:03,280 --> 02:21:06,800
down there, and I'm not interested in

3512
02:21:04,720 --> 02:21:09,359
finding out. The problem with debunking

3513
02:21:06,800 --> 02:21:11,359
is it's not an efficient use of time.

3514
02:21:09,359 --> 02:21:13,840
Some nerd online came up with an idea

3515
02:21:11,359 --> 02:21:16,080
called Brandolini's law. The amount of

3516
02:21:13,840 --> 02:21:17,840
energy needed to refute [ __ ] is an

3517
02:21:16,080 --> 02:21:20,000
order of magnitude bigger than that

3518
02:21:17,840 --> 02:21:21,760
needed to produce it. Conspiracists can

3519
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:23,920
invent a hundred conspiracies in the

3520
02:21:21,760 --> 02:21:26,000
time it takes to debunk one. And even

3521
02:21:23,920 --> 02:21:27,680
then, they'll invent a conspiracy to

3522
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:29,840
explain the lack of evidence for the one

3523
02:21:27,680 --> 02:21:31,680
you just debunked. Conspiracism is a

3524
02:21:29,840 --> 02:21:33,600
parody of critical thinking that

3525
02:21:31,680 --> 02:21:35,600
empowers people to believe whatever they

3526
02:21:33,600 --> 02:21:37,760
want to believe and to dismiss anything

3527
02:21:35,600 --> 02:21:39,600
challenging or inconvenient. Has a

3528
02:21:37,760 --> 02:21:41,840
disaster happened that's awkward for

3529
02:21:39,600 --> 02:21:43,600
your politics? Just say it was a hoax.

3530
02:21:41,840 --> 02:21:45,520
Are other conspiracists inciting

3531
02:21:43,600 --> 02:21:47,040
violence? Just say it's controlled

3532
02:21:45,520 --> 02:21:49,439
opposition. To a conspiracist

3533
02:21:47,040 --> 02:21:51,200
politician, every lost election is a

3534
02:21:49,439 --> 02:21:52,800
rigged election. And there's usually a

3535
02:21:51,200 --> 02:21:54,640
very selective and politically

3536
02:21:52,800 --> 02:21:56,640
convenient understanding of what even

3537
02:21:54,640 --> 02:21:58,560
counts as a conspiracy. Like

3538
02:21:56,640 --> 02:22:00,560
conspiracists who think survivors of

3539
02:21:58,560 --> 02:22:02,640
school shootings advocating firearms

3540
02:22:00,560 --> 02:22:04,560
regulation are a conspiracy. But the

3541
02:22:02,640 --> 02:22:06,800
billiondoll industry lobbying to prevent

3542
02:22:04,560 --> 02:22:08,640
that regulation, that's fine. That's not

3543
02:22:06,800 --> 02:22:10,640
a conspiracy. If you spend long enough

3544
02:22:08,640 --> 02:22:12,479
immersed in this kind of discourse, you

3545
02:22:10,640 --> 02:22:14,800
start to lose your grip on the concept

3546
02:22:12,479 --> 02:22:18,160
of truth. After months of conspiracy

3547
02:22:14,800 --> 02:22:20,479
research, I feel a withered sense of

3548
02:22:18,160 --> 02:22:22,479
reality, even as a detached and hostile

3549
02:22:20,479 --> 02:22:24,479
observer. So, what do we do with these

3550
02:22:22,479 --> 02:22:27,200
people? Can they be reasoned with at

3551
02:22:24,479 --> 02:22:29,760
all? The answer is usually no. And

3552
02:22:27,200 --> 02:22:31,840
that's scary because democracy depends

3553
02:22:29,760 --> 02:22:34,080
on us being able to deliberate. When

3554
02:22:31,840 --> 02:22:36,160
people can't communicate, conflicts

3555
02:22:34,080 --> 02:22:38,800
escalate into violence. But there's also

3556
02:22:36,160 --> 02:22:41,280
a personal cost to this. The subreddit

3557
02:22:38,800 --> 02:22:42,720
QAnon Casualties has thousands of posts

3558
02:22:41,280 --> 02:22:44,960
from people whose families and

3559
02:22:42,720 --> 02:22:47,359
relationships have been torn apart by

3560
02:22:44,960 --> 02:22:49,439
one person's obsessive conspiracism.

3561
02:22:47,359 --> 02:22:51,120
People talk about losing someone to

3562
02:22:49,439 --> 02:22:53,840
this. The way we talk about drug

3563
02:22:51,120 --> 02:22:55,600
addiction. It's like conspiracy research

3564
02:22:53,840 --> 02:22:57,680
completely takes over some people's

3565
02:22:55,600 --> 02:22:59,359
lives. It becomes the only thing they

3566
02:22:57,680 --> 02:23:02,080
care about, the only thing they talk

3567
02:22:59,359 --> 02:23:03,600
about, and it changes their personality.

3568
02:23:02,080 --> 02:23:06,160
And I'm sure people who know someone

3569
02:23:03,600 --> 02:23:08,399
like that will ask, "How can I save my

3570
02:23:06,160 --> 02:23:10,800
loved one?" And the only honest answer I

3571
02:23:08,399 --> 02:23:12,560
can give is, "I don't know." This is not

3572
02:23:10,800 --> 02:23:14,720
a video on how to blue pill your crazy

3573
02:23:12,560 --> 02:23:16,479
uncle. I think it's like addiction. You

3574
02:23:14,720 --> 02:23:18,319
can't force someone to change if they

3575
02:23:16,479 --> 02:23:20,240
don't want to change. You just can't

3576
02:23:18,319 --> 02:23:22,399
force feed someone blue pills. That's

3577
02:23:20,240 --> 02:23:24,319
what we have 5G towers for. But to even

3578
02:23:22,399 --> 02:23:25,760
have a chance of getting people out, we

3579
02:23:24,319 --> 02:23:27,680
should at least understand what gets

3580
02:23:25,760 --> 02:23:29,680
them in. And I do have a few final

3581
02:23:27,680 --> 02:23:32,479
thoughts about that. Why do some people

3582
02:23:29,680 --> 02:23:35,120
get addicted to conspiracy theories? I

3583
02:23:32,479 --> 02:23:38,160
think conspiracism must fulfill some

3584
02:23:35,120 --> 02:23:40,479
deep psychological needs. Need one is

3585
02:23:38,160 --> 02:23:42,319
relief from fear. I'm sorry, we're in

3586
02:23:40,479 --> 02:23:44,000
another list within a list. To

3587
02:23:42,319 --> 02:23:46,399
understand the structure of this video,

3588
02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:48,479
please consult this diagram. Fear is an

3589
02:23:46,399 --> 02:23:50,560
inherent part of politics. There's no

3590
02:23:48,479 --> 02:23:53,040
limit to how horrible humans can be to

3591
02:23:50,560 --> 02:23:55,439
each other, and it's very scary. I

3592
02:23:53,040 --> 02:23:58,080
personally am terrified of politics at

3593
02:23:55,439 --> 02:24:00,760
the moment, so I get it. But why does

3594
02:23:58,080 --> 02:24:02,560
conspiracism soothe fear? It seems

3595
02:24:00,760 --> 02:24:04,680
counterintuitive. The idea that the

3596
02:24:02,560 --> 02:24:06,560
world is controlled by an evil

3597
02:24:04,680 --> 02:24:07,840
cryptoaristocracy doesn't sound very

3598
02:24:06,560 --> 02:24:10,000
soothing. Like, are these people

3599
02:24:07,840 --> 02:24:12,000
masochists? Do they unconsciously want

3600
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:13,760
to be dominated by the Illuminati? Now

3601
02:24:12,000 --> 02:24:15,760
that I say it out loud, it actually does

3602
02:24:13,760 --> 02:24:17,840
sound kind of hot. Okay, I get it.

3603
02:24:15,760 --> 02:24:19,840
Michael Barkland says, "The conspiracy

3604
02:24:17,840 --> 02:24:21,840
theorist's view is both frightening and

3605
02:24:19,840 --> 02:24:23,920
reassuring." Reassuring because it

3606
02:24:21,840 --> 02:24:26,000
promises a world that is meaningful

3607
02:24:23,920 --> 02:24:27,520
rather than arbitrary. So even if it's

3608
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:30,319
scary to think the world is controlled

3609
02:24:27,520 --> 02:24:32,160
by Satanists, it's also a relief because

3610
02:24:30,319 --> 02:24:34,319
it means that everything happens for a

3611
02:24:32,160 --> 02:24:35,840
reason. It's like religion in that way.

3612
02:24:34,319 --> 02:24:38,399
Many people find it comforting to

3613
02:24:35,840 --> 02:24:40,640
imagine that God has a plan for us, even

3614
02:24:38,399 --> 02:24:43,040
if that plan involves earthquakes and

3615
02:24:40,640 --> 02:24:45,040
tsunamis. The Lord works in mysterious

3616
02:24:43,040 --> 02:24:47,200
ways. I personally do not find this

3617
02:24:45,040 --> 02:24:49,280
comforting at all. I do not understand

3618
02:24:47,200 --> 02:24:50,880
the archetypal appeal of the punishing

3619
02:24:49,280 --> 02:24:52,880
father. You know, it's like daddy

3620
02:24:50,880 --> 02:24:55,760
arrived and he's taken his belt off. But

3621
02:24:52,880 --> 02:24:58,080
so many people seem to be into it. So,

3622
02:24:55,760 --> 02:25:02,760
it's a thing. There has to be a point at

3623
02:24:58,080 --> 02:25:02,760
which dad comes home.

3624
02:25:02,960 --> 02:25:07,160
Yeah, that's

3625
02:25:04,520 --> 02:25:10,960
right. And he's

3626
02:25:07,160 --> 02:25:13,120
pissed. Dad is pissed. Need two is

3627
02:25:10,960 --> 02:25:14,880
inflated self-esteem. There's something

3628
02:25:13,120 --> 02:25:17,280
inherently grandiose about the whole

3629
02:25:14,880 --> 02:25:20,080
conspiracist persona. Conspiracy

3630
02:25:17,280 --> 02:25:22,319
researchers or investigators claim to

3631
02:25:20,080 --> 02:25:24,479
have privileged access to secret

3632
02:25:22,319 --> 02:25:27,520
knowledge thanks to their bravely

3633
02:25:24,479 --> 02:25:29,600
defiant Galileoike willingness to ask

3634
02:25:27,520 --> 02:25:31,920
dangerous questions the brainwashed

3635
02:25:29,600 --> 02:25:34,000
sheeple dare not entertain. It's such a

3636
02:25:31,920 --> 02:25:36,800
teenage mindset, right? I remember

3637
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:39,760
thinking this way when I was 16. I alone

3638
02:25:36,800 --> 02:25:41,760
question the system. Everyone else is a

3639
02:25:39,760 --> 02:25:44,560
programmed sheep who does as they're

3640
02:25:41,760 --> 02:25:47,359
told. But I am burdened with an inner

3641
02:25:44,560 --> 02:25:49,280
darkness that lets me see the truth.

3642
02:25:47,359 --> 02:25:51,040
That high school is a prison.

3643
02:25:49,280 --> 02:25:52,880
Conspiracists take this narcissism even

3644
02:25:51,040 --> 02:25:55,040
further. It's not enough for them to be

3645
02:25:52,880 --> 02:25:57,040
Socrates and Sherlock Holmes. They also

3646
02:25:55,040 --> 02:25:59,520
have to be Jesus Christ, some kind of

3647
02:25:57,040 --> 02:26:01,359
persecuted murderer heroically fighting

3648
02:25:59,520 --> 02:26:04,000
the forces of evil and the information

3649
02:26:01,359 --> 02:26:05,680
war. It's like Don Kote, the book we all

3650
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:07,680
pretend to have read about an aging

3651
02:26:05,680 --> 02:26:09,920
noble who reads chivalrich fantasy

3652
02:26:07,680 --> 02:26:11,359
novels all day and deludes himself into

3653
02:26:09,920 --> 02:26:12,960
thinking he's a knight. For

3654
02:26:11,359 --> 02:26:15,840
conspiracists, the persona of

3655
02:26:12,960 --> 02:26:18,399
investigator gives them a noble purpose.

3656
02:26:15,840 --> 02:26:20,160
It makes them important. But instead of

3657
02:26:18,399 --> 02:26:22,080
giants, they think windmills are

3658
02:26:20,160 --> 02:26:24,640
directed energy weapons. And instead of

3659
02:26:22,080 --> 02:26:26,880
chivalick fantasy, their literary model

3660
02:26:24,640 --> 02:26:29,840
is like the dystopian fiction we had to

3661
02:26:26,880 --> 02:26:31,720
read in high school. 1984, Brave New

3662
02:26:29,840 --> 02:26:35,200
World, Fahrenheit

3663
02:26:31,720 --> 02:26:37,120
451, you are here. Oh my god, how can

3664
02:26:35,200 --> 02:26:39,040
the richest man on Earth have this much

3665
02:26:37,120 --> 02:26:40,479
of a persecution complex? There's not

3666
02:26:39,040 --> 02:26:43,600
enough ketamine in the world to fix

3667
02:26:40,479 --> 02:26:44,880
this. Need three is revenge humiliation.

3668
02:26:43,600 --> 02:26:47,040
I've noticed a lot of professional

3669
02:26:44,880 --> 02:26:49,560
conspiracy theorists became what they

3670
02:26:47,040 --> 02:26:52,560
are after some experience of public

3671
02:26:49,560 --> 02:26:54,960
humiliation. David Ike was a BBC sports

3672
02:26:52,560 --> 02:26:57,280
presenter until his 1991 appearance on

3673
02:26:54,960 --> 02:26:59,520
the TV talk show Wogan, where he

3674
02:26:57,280 --> 02:27:01,760
announced to the British public that he

3675
02:26:59,520 --> 02:27:04,080
was the son of God and prophecied a

3676
02:27:01,760 --> 02:27:08,080
plague of tidal waves and earthquakes.

3677
02:27:04,080 --> 02:27:11,439
The press claim that you claim to be the

3678
02:27:08,080 --> 02:27:13,200
son of God. Mhm. Is that true? Yes. You

3679
02:27:11,439 --> 02:27:14,720
see, the thing is that you see it's

3680
02:27:13,200 --> 02:27:16,640
quite it's quite funny really. The

3681
02:27:14,720 --> 02:27:18,479
studio audience ridiculed him live on

3682
02:27:16,640 --> 02:27:20,479
air and afterward he says he quote

3683
02:27:18,479 --> 02:27:22,160
couldn't walk down any street in Britain

3684
02:27:20,479 --> 02:27:23,920
without being laughed at. It was a

3685
02:27:22,160 --> 02:27:25,280
nightmare. My children were devastated

3686
02:27:23,920 --> 02:27:27,520
because their dad was a figure of

3687
02:27:25,280 --> 02:27:29,920
ridicule. This got him wondering who

3688
02:27:27,520 --> 02:27:31,840
really was behind this vicious smear

3689
02:27:29,920 --> 02:27:34,800
campaign. And his answer to that

3690
02:27:31,840 --> 02:27:36,800
question was apparently reptilians. An

3691
02:27:34,800 --> 02:27:38,720
idea he promoted on a lecture tour of

3692
02:27:36,800 --> 02:27:40,800
North America where this sort of

3693
02:27:38,720 --> 02:27:43,040
behavior is appreciated. Where nations

3694
02:27:40,800 --> 02:27:45,439
of the world send all their maniacs.

3695
02:27:43,040 --> 02:27:47,840
Likewise, Naomi Wolf went from respected

3696
02:27:45,439 --> 02:27:50,160
liberal feminist to conspiracist co-host

3697
02:27:47,840 --> 02:27:52,520
of Steve Bannon's podcast and one of the

3698
02:27:50,160 --> 02:27:55,000
most deranged posters in the history of

3699
02:27:52,520 --> 02:27:57,840
X.com. No.

3700
02:27:55,000 --> 02:27:59,840
No. Naomi was never the best fact

3701
02:27:57,840 --> 02:28:02,640
checker, but her descent fully began

3702
02:27:59,840 --> 02:28:04,880
during a 2019 BBC radio interview about

3703
02:28:02,640 --> 02:28:07,200
her new book on 19th century persecution

3704
02:28:04,880 --> 02:28:09,280
of homosexuality when the host noticed

3705
02:28:07,200 --> 02:28:11,439
that a fundamental premise of her book

3706
02:28:09,280 --> 02:28:13,600
was based on a misunderstanding of legal

3707
02:28:11,439 --> 02:28:15,840
terms. Any author knows this is a

3708
02:28:13,600 --> 02:28:17,840
nightmare scenario, but Twitter was

3709
02:28:15,840 --> 02:28:20,160
gleefully mean about it because Twitter

3710
02:28:17,840 --> 02:28:22,640
is a gleefully mean place. Within a

3711
02:28:20,160 --> 02:28:26,080
year, Naomi had become a leading CO 19

3712
02:28:22,640 --> 02:28:28,720
conspiracy theorist. Antivax, anti-mask,

3713
02:28:26,080 --> 02:28:30,479
ranting about chemtrails and 5G towers.

3714
02:28:28,720 --> 02:28:33,439
It was like she was taking her revenge

3715
02:28:30,479 --> 02:28:35,920
on the concept of factuality itself.

3716
02:28:33,439 --> 02:28:38,080
What the heck is in our oxygen supply?

3717
02:28:35,920 --> 02:28:39,840
Candace Owens is a conservative pundit

3718
02:28:38,080 --> 02:28:42,240
whose latest obsession is claiming that

3719
02:28:39,840 --> 02:28:44,800
Judaism is controlled from within by a

3720
02:28:42,240 --> 02:28:47,040
secret sect called Frankists who

3721
02:28:44,800 --> 02:28:48,800
practice ritual murder and child abuse.

3722
02:28:47,040 --> 02:28:50,399
These pedophiles are in power. What we

3723
02:28:48,800 --> 02:28:51,520
are referring to is a religion that is

3724
02:28:50,399 --> 02:28:52,880
known as frankism which we came to the

3725
02:28:51,520 --> 02:28:54,399
limo religion. It is the preferred

3726
02:28:52,880 --> 02:28:55,840
religion of the elites. Okay? They

3727
02:28:54,399 --> 02:28:57,200
believe and they worship the devil. You

3728
02:28:55,840 --> 02:28:59,680
can't even say that this is like a

3729
02:28:57,200 --> 02:29:01,840
modern take on blood label because it's

3730
02:28:59,680 --> 02:29:04,240
literally just blood liel. Candace Owens

3731
02:29:01,840 --> 02:29:06,720
is a blood liel promoter. But Candace

3732
02:29:04,240 --> 02:29:08,640
once was a progressive. In high school,

3733
02:29:06,720 --> 02:29:10,720
she experienced racist threats from

3734
02:29:08,640 --> 02:29:13,520
classmates, influencing her to become a

3735
02:29:10,720 --> 02:29:16,080
critic of systemic racism until an

3736
02:29:13,520 --> 02:29:18,720
incident in 2016 when she launched

3737
02:29:16,080 --> 02:29:20,640
social autopsy.com, a platform that

3738
02:29:18,720 --> 02:29:23,120
would archive offensive social media

3739
02:29:20,640 --> 02:29:24,680
posts and connect them to posters names,

3740
02:29:23,120 --> 02:29:27,520
which would then be searchable by

3741
02:29:24,680 --> 02:29:29,520
employers. This did not go over well on

3742
02:29:27,520 --> 02:29:31,760
any part of the political spectrum. The

3743
02:29:29,520 --> 02:29:34,319
consensus was that she had created

3744
02:29:31,760 --> 02:29:36,960
essentially a doxing database and the

3745
02:29:34,319 --> 02:29:39,600
internet responded as the internet does

3746
02:29:36,960 --> 02:29:41,600
by doxing Candace. In other words, she

3747
02:29:39,600 --> 02:29:43,280
was cancelled and she blamed this on

3748
02:29:41,600 --> 02:29:45,120
progressives saying it became a

3749
02:29:43,280 --> 02:29:46,720
conservative overnight. You know, I

3750
02:29:45,120 --> 02:29:48,160
realized that liberals were actually the

3751
02:29:46,720 --> 02:29:50,319
racists, that liberals were actually the

3752
02:29:48,160 --> 02:29:52,240
trolls. And then Trump is on the screen

3753
02:29:50,319 --> 02:29:54,240
saying that the media is lying, that CNN

3754
02:29:52,240 --> 02:29:55,600
is fake. It all began to resonate with

3755
02:29:54,240 --> 02:29:57,840
me because I realized that everything he

3756
02:29:55,600 --> 02:29:59,840
was saying was true because I knew that

3757
02:29:57,840 --> 02:30:01,280
the media hired hitmen. Within a year,

3758
02:29:59,840 --> 02:30:03,439
she was denying the existence of

3759
02:30:01,280 --> 02:30:05,840
systemic racism and claiming that black

3760
02:30:03,439 --> 02:30:08,319
Americans problems stem from welfare,

3761
02:30:05,840 --> 02:30:10,479
handouts, broken families, you know, the

3762
02:30:08,319 --> 02:30:12,760
song and dance. So, it seems like Naomi

3763
02:30:10,479 --> 02:30:15,040
Wolf and Candace Owens feminism and

3764
02:30:12,760 --> 02:30:17,359
anti-racism were mostly based on

3765
02:30:15,040 --> 02:30:19,200
personal feelings of persecution. And

3766
02:30:17,359 --> 02:30:21,200
then the moment they felt personally

3767
02:30:19,200 --> 02:30:23,040
persecuted by progressives, they

3768
02:30:21,200 --> 02:30:24,880
switched teams and became a conservative

3769
02:30:23,040 --> 02:30:27,120
overnight. Conspiracism appeals to

3770
02:30:24,880 --> 02:30:29,760
people who feel humiliated because it

3771
02:30:27,120 --> 02:30:33,120
externalizes blame and casts you as the

3772
02:30:29,760 --> 02:30:35,680
hero fighting back. 2,000 years ago, had

3773
02:30:33,120 --> 02:30:36,960
a guy called Jesus sat here and said

3774
02:30:35,680 --> 02:30:38,720
these same things, you would still be

3775
02:30:36,960 --> 02:30:40,560
laughing. It's really, really funny that

3776
02:30:38,720 --> 02:30:42,399
we've not really moved on that much. Of

3777
02:30:40,560 --> 02:30:44,160
course, for everyday non-ceelebrity

3778
02:30:42,399 --> 02:30:46,240
conspiracists, the source of that

3779
02:30:44,160 --> 02:30:48,640
humiliation might be more subtle. It

3780
02:30:46,240 --> 02:30:50,800
could be a divorce, losing a job, or

3781
02:30:48,640 --> 02:30:52,479
just a feeling that your life didn't

3782
02:30:50,800 --> 02:30:54,479
turn out the way you wanted it to. You

3783
02:30:52,479 --> 02:30:56,880
miss being young and full of hope, and

3784
02:30:54,479 --> 02:30:59,319
you're like, "Who took that from me?

3785
02:30:56,880 --> 02:31:01,520
Remember what the Jews took from

3786
02:30:59,319 --> 02:31:04,080
you?" God. At the beginning of The

3787
02:31:01,520 --> 02:31:06,160
Matrix, Mr. Anderson's life sucks. He

3788
02:31:04,080 --> 02:31:08,720
lives in a dirty bachelor pad. He hates

3789
02:31:06,160 --> 02:31:10,880
his job. He's humiliated by his boss.

3790
02:31:08,720 --> 02:31:13,359
Either you choose to be at your desk on

3791
02:31:10,880 --> 02:31:15,520
time from this day forth, or you choose

3792
02:31:13,359 --> 02:31:17,359
to find yourself another job. But then

3793
02:31:15,520 --> 02:31:20,000
he takes the red pill and learns that

3794
02:31:17,359 --> 02:31:22,640
his job, his boss, his taxes, all of

3795
02:31:20,000 --> 02:31:25,439
that was just an evil simulation. A lot

3796
02:31:22,640 --> 02:31:28,000
of men in particular feel humiliated by

3797
02:31:25,439 --> 02:31:30,319
modernity itself. Like in Fight Club,

3798
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:33,280
these middle-class men feel emasculated

3799
02:31:30,319 --> 02:31:36,000
by their white collar jobs. Cucked. And

3800
02:31:33,280 --> 02:31:38,240
conspiracy investigation can be a way to

3801
02:31:36,000 --> 02:31:40,319
reclaim heroic masculinity from the

3802
02:31:38,240 --> 02:31:42,720
comfort of your desk chair. And it is a

3803
02:31:40,319 --> 02:31:45,120
traditionally masculine activity, though

3804
02:31:42,720 --> 02:31:47,200
recently that's changed. A lot of women

3805
02:31:45,120 --> 02:31:49,120
get into conspiracism via alternative

3806
02:31:47,200 --> 02:31:51,280
health and wellness, often after

3807
02:31:49,120 --> 02:31:53,439
frustrating or humiliating experiences

3808
02:31:51,280 --> 02:31:55,439
with mainstream medicine, which can

3809
02:31:53,439 --> 02:31:58,479
still be quite misogynistic. A lot of

3810
02:31:55,439 --> 02:32:01,120
women got into QAnon because of its meto

3811
02:31:58,479 --> 02:32:03,280
adjacent themes of exposing powerful sex

3812
02:32:01,120 --> 02:32:05,840
criminals and the sort of heroic

3813
02:32:03,280 --> 02:32:08,000
femininity of saving children. Just as

3814
02:32:05,840 --> 02:32:10,240
conspiracism has always enabled cranks

3815
02:32:08,000 --> 02:32:13,040
to play the intellectual without real

3816
02:32:10,240 --> 02:32:15,840
learning, QAnon enabled women to care

3817
02:32:13,040 --> 02:32:18,280
for children without the difficult parts

3818
02:32:15,840 --> 02:32:20,960
of caring for children. It's child care

3819
02:32:18,280 --> 02:32:23,120
without the child. I understand the

3820
02:32:20,960 --> 02:32:24,800
appeal. My children are my subscribers.

3821
02:32:23,120 --> 02:32:27,160
Like and subscribe. Universal in

3822
02:32:24,800 --> 02:32:29,680
conspiracy discourse is a longing for

3823
02:32:27,160 --> 02:32:32,319
vindication. This sense of you will all

3824
02:32:29,680 --> 02:32:34,240
see, then you'll be sorry. The ultimate

3825
02:32:32,319 --> 02:32:36,160
conspiracist wishfulfillment fantasy is

3826
02:32:34,240 --> 02:32:38,160
the end of the movie National Treasure,

3827
02:32:36,160 --> 02:32:39,760
where conspiracist Frank Nicholas Cage

3828
02:32:38,160 --> 02:32:41,680
is no longer a disappointment to his

3829
02:32:39,760 --> 02:32:43,840
father. He's vindicated to all the

3830
02:32:41,680 --> 02:32:45,760
academics who mocked him. He's wildly

3831
02:32:43,840 --> 02:32:47,280
rich and Diane Krueger wants to [ __ ]

3832
02:32:45,760 --> 02:32:49,359
him. Yes, we all have our little

3833
02:32:47,280 --> 02:32:51,359
fantasies. All of this is deeply

3834
02:32:49,359 --> 02:32:54,080
pathetic, but I think it's important to

3835
02:32:51,359 --> 02:32:56,399
understand because it explains why it's

3836
02:32:54,080 --> 02:32:58,000
so difficult to reason people out of

3837
02:32:56,399 --> 02:32:59,920
conspiracism. You're not just asking

3838
02:32:58,000 --> 02:33:02,399
them to change their mind. You're asking

3839
02:32:59,920 --> 02:33:05,040
them to give up an identity that makes

3840
02:33:02,399 --> 02:33:06,640
them feel like they matter, and they're

3841
02:33:05,040 --> 02:33:09,120
not going to do that until they find

3842
02:33:06,640 --> 02:33:11,760
something else to fill the void. Need

3843
02:33:09,120 --> 02:33:13,359
four is the denial of privilege. Another

3844
02:33:11,760 --> 02:33:14,720
reason the left always loses. That's a

3845
02:33:13,359 --> 02:33:16,479
good way to start a section. A little

3846
02:33:14,720 --> 02:33:18,319
bit of optimism. Another reason the left

3847
02:33:16,479 --> 02:33:20,880
always loses is the left wants you to

3848
02:33:18,319 --> 02:33:22,880
check your privilege. And no one wants

3849
02:33:20,880 --> 02:33:25,280
to do that. We all participate in

3850
02:33:22,880 --> 02:33:27,439
systems of exploitation to some extent,

3851
02:33:25,280 --> 02:33:29,520
not because we're evil, but just out of

3852
02:33:27,439 --> 02:33:31,600
passive inertia. But acknowledging that

3853
02:33:29,520 --> 02:33:33,520
is emotionally difficult because it

3854
02:33:31,600 --> 02:33:35,359
makes you feel guilty. It makes your

3855
02:33:33,520 --> 02:33:37,520
persecuted martyr persona look

3856
02:33:35,359 --> 02:33:40,160
ridiculous and it burdens you with

3857
02:33:37,520 --> 02:33:42,479
obligations to other people. God forbid.

3858
02:33:40,160 --> 02:33:44,560
Conspiracists on the other hand always

3859
02:33:42,479 --> 02:33:47,120
assure you that you are at the bottom of

3860
02:33:44,560 --> 02:33:48,920
the pyramid. You are here. This

3861
02:33:47,120 --> 02:33:51,280
validates your pain and sense of

3862
02:33:48,920 --> 02:33:53,359
victimhood and it protects you from

3863
02:33:51,280 --> 02:33:55,280
having to consider that you may in some

3864
02:33:53,359 --> 02:33:58,000
way be involved in the oppression of

3865
02:33:55,280 --> 02:34:01,120
other people. Morpheus tells Neo, "The

3866
02:33:58,000 --> 02:34:02,960
matrix is everywhere. It is the world

3867
02:34:01,120 --> 02:34:05,720
that has been pulled over your eyes to

3868
02:34:02,960 --> 02:34:09,600
blind you from the truth." What

3869
02:34:05,720 --> 02:34:11,200
truth? That you are a slave. Neo, in a

3870
02:34:09,600 --> 02:34:13,760
way, it's the ultimate white person

3871
02:34:11,200 --> 02:34:16,800
fantasy that a wise black man tells you

3872
02:34:13,760 --> 02:34:18,720
that it's you who's really the slave.

3873
02:34:16,800 --> 02:34:21,200
Conspiracists don't think in terms of

3874
02:34:18,720 --> 02:34:23,439
systems. To them, oppression is always

3875
02:34:21,200 --> 02:34:26,240
an intentional act of evil. This makes

3876
02:34:23,439 --> 02:34:28,399
them amazingly oblivious to more diffuse

3877
02:34:26,240 --> 02:34:30,479
forms of power like the power of men

3878
02:34:28,399 --> 02:34:32,640
over women or the power of an empire

3879
02:34:30,479 --> 02:34:35,359
over its colonies. In other words,

3880
02:34:32,640 --> 02:34:37,439
conspiracists do not notice the clubs

3881
02:34:35,359 --> 02:34:39,280
that they are in. Now, if you point this

3882
02:34:37,439 --> 02:34:41,600
out, you'll be told that this is

3883
02:34:39,280 --> 02:34:44,000
identity politics, which is a tactic the

3884
02:34:41,600 --> 02:34:45,760
elites use to divide us. Okay? But those

3885
02:34:44,000 --> 02:34:47,439
divides are already there. you just

3886
02:34:45,760 --> 02:34:49,760
choose not to notice them except when

3887
02:34:47,439 --> 02:34:51,520
it's convenient and it blinds you to the

3888
02:34:49,760 --> 02:34:54,240
truth about the real reasons for

3889
02:34:51,520 --> 02:34:56,640
oppression and injustice. Most of us in

3890
02:34:54,240 --> 02:34:58,720
fact exist somewhere in the middle of

3891
02:34:56,640 --> 02:35:01,680
the pyramid. Most people watching this

3892
02:34:58,720 --> 02:35:04,160
video benefit to some extent from a very

3893
02:35:01,680 --> 02:35:05,840
unequal global distribution of power

3894
02:35:04,160 --> 02:35:08,000
built on the exploitation of other

3895
02:35:05,840 --> 02:35:10,160
people, other species, and the earth

3896
02:35:08,000 --> 02:35:12,640
itself. Conspiracists love their

3897
02:35:10,160 --> 02:35:15,439
livestock metaphors, always comparing we

3898
02:35:12,640 --> 02:35:19,160
the people to cattle and sheep. But how

3899
02:35:15,439 --> 02:35:21,600
do we the people treat literal sheep and

3900
02:35:19,160 --> 02:35:24,000
cattle? Not well. I noticed most

3901
02:35:21,600 --> 02:35:26,080
conspiracists are not vegan. And I'm not

3902
02:35:24,000 --> 02:35:28,160
being preachy here. I'm not vegan

3903
02:35:26,080 --> 02:35:30,240
either. Yes, I've seen all the sad vegan

3904
02:35:28,160 --> 02:35:33,439
documentaries and I agree. The way

3905
02:35:30,240 --> 02:35:35,439
animals are treated is horrible. But it

3906
02:35:33,439 --> 02:35:38,319
doesn't actually motivate me to stop

3907
02:35:35,439 --> 02:35:40,319
eating meat. Why? Well, I've been

3908
02:35:38,319 --> 02:35:44,000
introspecting about this and I think

3909
02:35:40,319 --> 02:35:46,640
it's because I am just not that good of

3910
02:35:44,000 --> 02:35:48,479
a person. Not that I'm satanic. I don't

3911
02:35:46,640 --> 02:35:51,040
slaughter animals for fun while chanting

3912
02:35:48,479 --> 02:35:53,840
the names of demons. At least not

3913
02:35:51,040 --> 02:35:56,720
anymore. I've listened and I'm learning.

3914
02:35:53,840 --> 02:35:59,200
But I am complacent and selfish. I

3915
02:35:56,720 --> 02:36:01,600
prioritize my own habits, comfort,

3916
02:35:59,200 --> 02:36:03,680
health, and pleasure. I don't have this

3917
02:36:01,600 --> 02:36:06,760
martyr impulse. I don't think this makes

3918
02:36:03,680 --> 02:36:09,520
me evil. I think it makes me morally

3919
02:36:06,760 --> 02:36:11,439
average. And when you take a vast global

3920
02:36:09,520 --> 02:36:13,840
economy built on centuries of

3921
02:36:11,439 --> 02:36:16,000
exploitation and fill it with morally

3922
02:36:13,840 --> 02:36:18,800
average primates who evolved to survive

3923
02:36:16,000 --> 02:36:20,800
in small groups with limited resources,

3924
02:36:18,800 --> 02:36:22,560
you really don't need a conspiracy to

3925
02:36:20,800 --> 02:36:24,720
explain the results. If you want to

3926
02:36:22,560 --> 02:36:26,880
understand the mindset of the elites,

3927
02:36:24,720 --> 02:36:29,120
look at yourself. Billionaires are not a

3928
02:36:26,880 --> 02:36:31,600
different species. They're just people,

3929
02:36:29,120 --> 02:36:33,840
often broken people with way too much

3930
02:36:31,600 --> 02:36:36,000
power. When you deny the humanity of the

3931
02:36:33,840 --> 02:36:38,160
oppressors, you also conceal the

3932
02:36:36,000 --> 02:36:40,560
potential oppressor in yourself and in

3933
02:36:38,160 --> 02:36:43,920
all people, even people you think of as

3934
02:36:40,560 --> 02:36:46,560
the good guys. We are all metaphorically

3935
02:36:43,920 --> 02:36:48,880
part reptile. So stop hunting for

3936
02:36:46,560 --> 02:36:51,359
witches and Satanists and pay more

3937
02:36:48,880 --> 02:36:54,040
attention to ordinary selfishness,

3938
02:36:51,359 --> 02:36:56,800
ignorance, complacency, fear, envy,

3939
02:36:54,040 --> 02:36:59,760
sadism, scapegoating, the psychology of

3940
02:36:56,800 --> 02:37:01,520
mobs, the drive for retribution. And pay

3941
02:36:59,760 --> 02:37:03,520
attention to how all of that interacts

3942
02:37:01,520 --> 02:37:06,479
with power. These are the real forces

3943
02:37:03,520 --> 02:37:08,800
behind human events, not secret schemes

3944
02:37:06,479 --> 02:37:10,960
of shadowy super villains. There is no

3945
02:37:08,800 --> 02:37:13,760
epic battle between good guys and bad

3946
02:37:10,960 --> 02:37:17,720
guys. There's humans and there's power

3947
02:37:13,760 --> 02:37:21,359
and that's it. Who really controls the

3948
02:37:17,720 --> 02:37:25,200
world? No one. There are no adults. It's

3949
02:37:21,359 --> 02:37:28,200
just us. There is no plan unless we make

3950
02:37:25,200 --> 02:37:28,200
one.
