am a transsexual that means i have a

67
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,840
very specific mental disorder called

68
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,840
gender dysphoria

69
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,440
i was born a boy but i have a female

70
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,080
brain because of a hormone imbalance in

71
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,239
the womb

72
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,760
this is a real psychiatric disorder that

73
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:49,599
is verified by science

74
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,599
and requires hormones and surgery for

75
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:52,239
treatment or else i literally cannot

76
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:54,400
function

77
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:56,400
it is not a fashion statement it is not

78
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,680
a trend it is not an easy way to feel

79
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,840
special and depressed

80
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:02,080
it is a very difficult condition to live

81
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,080
with

82
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:07,760

00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:15,280
transsexual

86
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:17,120

88
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,920
not a gender a trans trender is a person

89
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:22,480
like

90
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:24,159
baltimore over here who puts on a dress

91
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,840
and puts glitter in his beard

92
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:27,760
and goes around telling people he's

93
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,000
transgender and complaining about

94
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,799
misgendering for oppression points

95
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,400
actually

96
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:36,239
it's they what i use they them pronouns

97
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,760
they go around collecting oppression

98
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:40,879
points as you can see

99
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:42,720
why do you say that tiffany tumbles have

100
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:46,319
i complained about oppression

101
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:48,239
so far it seems to me that it is you

102
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:49,680
who has been complaining about your

103
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:52,159
dysphoria

104
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,599
isn't it you who is collecting

105
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:56,480
oppression points

106
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:57,599
tiffany tumbles oh no i'm not i'm not

107
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,760
saying i'm oppressed

108
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:00,959
i'm saying i have dysphoria which is not

109
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:04,239
society's fault

110
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:05,200
it's in my brain i was diagnosed it's a

111
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:08,319
fact

112
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:12,080
it's real my pain is real and

113
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:13,360
my pain isn't real it's interesting that

114
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,360
you think that

115
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,639
well what pain are you talking about

116
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,160
people making fun of you because you

117
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:19,519
dressed like a circus act

118
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,919
interesting that you mentioned the

119
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:24,240
circus tiffany tumbles

120
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:25,759
don't you think we should examine why

121
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,160
society confines

122
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:30,479
gender variant people to the circus

123
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,600
you're not confined anywhere you choose

124
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:34,320
to dress like that

125
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,360
and why do you choose to dress the way

126
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,360
you dress

127
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,639
because i'm a woman so i'm dressed like

128
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,560
a woman hello

129
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:43,199
and i'm non-binary so i dress

130
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:45,919
non-conforming

131
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:47,120
why should i conceal who i am just to

132
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:49,680
appease

133
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,759
small-minded people well it's a free

134
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,759
country if you want to be a good of your

135
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:55,840
gender [ __ ] then go ahead

136
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,960
but don't go around telling people that

137
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,479
you're transgender

138
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,639
because it makes us all look like a

139
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:04,160
bunch of trendy freaks but aren't we

140
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:06,720
all freaks in the eyes of society

141
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,479
do you think you can purchase acceptance

142
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,199
through conformity

143
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:12,320
because that is not freedom tiffany

144
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:15,360
tumbles

145
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:16,320
that is simply adding another cell to

146
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,720
the prison

147
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,960
it's not about conforming it's about me

148
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,680
having an actual medical condition

149
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:25,199
you do not have a female brain you have

150
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:29,600
a fashion disaster

151
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:32,000
oh do they well tell me tiffany tumbles

152
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,120
when the doctor prescribed your hormones

153
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,680
did he

154
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,479
take a look at your brain then what of

155
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,759
course not

156
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:40,639
but you have seen a skin of your brain

157
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:43,840
yes

158
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:44,639
well no where are you going with this i

159
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,120
mean

160
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,880
if you've never seen your brain and the

161
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,680
doctor who diagnosed your gender

162
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:54,880
dysphoria didn't look at it then

163
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:59,360
tell me tiffany tumbles how do you

164
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:59,360
know that you have a female brain

165
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,360
oh [ __ ] that's a good point no it isn't

166
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:06,960
look

167
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,120
there's scientific studies can you

168
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:12,319
explain to me the difference

169
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:15,520
between a male brain and a female brain

170
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:16,160
are they different colors i'm not an

171
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,919
expert

172
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,280
but there's science showing that men and

173
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:22,160
women have brain differences

174
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:23,520
i see but your doctor never looked at

175
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,400
your brain

176
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:27,440
so how did he know that you have gender

177
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,440
dysphoria

178
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,639
well he asked me questions and i told

179
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:34,160
him about it

180
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:36,639
and you told him what exactly

181
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,000
that i experienced gender dysphoria so

182
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:40,560
would you agree then

183
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,919
that your gender dysphoria and therefore

184
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,960
your identity

185
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:47,600
is valid not because of any observed

186
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:50,479
facts about your brain but

187
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,479

214
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:56,400
psychiatric diagnosis that i wouldn't

under my skin because it really

221
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:10,879
rattles my dysphoria that you're sitting

222
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:12,240
here claiming to represent the

223
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:14,000
transgender community

224
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,520
when in fact you're just making a

225
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,879
mockery of my pain

226
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:22,160
your pain you're in a lot of pain

227
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:24,560
aren't you tiffany tumbles well

228
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,000
i can sense the vibrations of your pain

229
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,960
across the room

230
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,440
and i pity you tiffany tumbles i pity

231
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,599
you

232
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,839
because you don't think you're real

233
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:35,279
until a man in a lab coat signs a

234
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:38,800
prescription pad

235
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:41,839
and i can't imagine what it must be like

236
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:44,880
to have so little confidence in your own

237
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:46,640
reality okay well don't patronize me i'm

238
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:49,120
just trying to understand

239
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,560
tiffany tumbles why you think being

240
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:53,600
transgender is all about

241
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:55,120
hating yourself and hating your body why

242
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,839
can't trans identity be

243
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:59,680
joyful and celebratory now you don't

244
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:02,000
have to hate yourself or hate your body

245
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:03,279
but you do have to have dysphoria and if

246
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,279
you tell people otherwise

247
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:07,680
you're just misleading them i want to

248
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:10,880

267
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,760
from the sjw prayer book

268
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:49,600

heroes in uniform and

276
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,560
let them know how much we appreciate

277
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,640
their service

278
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,920
god i love the troops thinking about the

279
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:18,800
troops makes me wet

280
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:20,160
it makes me [ __ ] semper fi boys what

281
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,279
i think i'm starting to wrap my head

282
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:24,959
around this tiffany your

283
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:25,519
transsexualism i have to say i don't

284
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:28,000
love it

285
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:29,200
but you do seem to at least be aware

286
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,240
that you have some kind of mental

287
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:34,079
disorder so

288
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:35,519
i'll give you that whereas baltimore

289
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:38,640
you're what making some kind of

290
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:40,720
statement if my existence is a statement

291
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,240
i think that says more about society

292
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,920
than it says about me

293
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,920
jackie what you have to understand is

294
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,959
there have been transsexuals around for

295
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:49,440
a long time

296
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:51,120
i've talked to 80 year old transsexuals

297
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,000
and they agree with me that all this

298
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,120
genderqueer

299
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,680
[ __ ] it's just a trend it's a fact

300
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:59,680
but is it for thousands of years there

301
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:02,079
have been third gender groups across

302
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,720
human cultures there's the hedra of

303
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:04,640
india

304
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,320
the two-spirit people among native

305
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,640
americans whereas

306
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:11,040
binary transsexualism is a medical

307
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:13,120
construct of the 20th century

308
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:16,480
gender dysphoria wasn't even a

309
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:19,920
recognized medical condition until 2013

310
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:23,200
meaning that tumblr is twice as old

311
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:26,320
as the first gender dysphoria diagnosis

312
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:32,000
so perhaps it is you tiffany tumbles

313
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:32,000
and not i who is following a trend

314
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,600
wow that just blew my mind the tables

315
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,399
are turned [ __ ]

316
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:44,399
tiffany could you explain to me why you

317
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:44,399
decided to become a transtrender

318
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:51,040
he's not native american though they

319
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:52,560
they you know it's kind of hard not to

320
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,200
call you he when you have a [ __ ]

321
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,720
beard

322
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,320
if you were actually trans and you

323
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,079
actually had dysphoria then you wouldn't

324
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:01,200
be comfortable with that your honor

325
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:04,160
in my defense it is a glitter beard okay

326
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,800
well that's very 2019 very gender very

327
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,680
they

328
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:09,440
but what it isn't is two spirit look the

329
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,639
sjws don't even agree with this they

330
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,800
think it's racist

331
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:14,000
white people have two genders pick one

332
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,480
and sit down dude

333
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,240
yeah that's a good point two genders two

334
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,639

[Music]

338
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:41,440
i don't have dysphoria the one thing

339
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:44,480
you'll always have to deal with in life

340
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:47,600
is [ __ ] it's hard to be yourself

341
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:50,160
but it's worth it let's be ourselves

00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,760
let's totally be ourselves oh right

343
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:54,800
that's enough of this

344
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:56,800
you know as a biological female

345
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,240
i honestly don't understand any of this

346
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,240
[ __ ] okay

00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,760

351
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,360
well sure but that is a matter between

her

353
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,120
and the lord let's not think about it

354
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,839
too much

355
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:15,680
anyway tiffany my brain has an easier

356
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:17,760
time processing you than

357
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:19,360

00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:23,360
congratulations you're the winner

that was some excellent free speech okay

360
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:29,360
great so in conclusion transtrenders

361
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:31,279
are real and probably dangerous make

362
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,600

the debate

369
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:48,639

00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,600
they gave their cheek to them that

375
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:04,800
mocked their beard and did knock their

376
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:08,000

tiffany there is nothing more sad and

406
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:27,120
pathetic

407
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:28,079
and desperate and low in this world than

408
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,880
a tran

409
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:33,279
who thinks she's better than other trans

410
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:34,079
it's like a drunk feeling superior to a

411
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:35,759
junkie

412
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:37,040
you seem to think that you're queen of

413
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:38,320
the world because you're hanging onto

414
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,639
societal acceptance

415
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,680
by two fingers instead of one well

416
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:43,920
you're not [ __ ]

417
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:46,079
you're just an insecure frightened

418
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,680
little queer who's determined to use the

419
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:50,160
one ounce of power you have

420
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:51,440
to tread other people down and if i'm

421
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:55,600
being honest

422
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:57,700
i don't find that very admirable

423
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:00,800
your eyelashes coming unglued

424
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:04,240
[Music]

425
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:05,600
my life is coming unclude

426
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,959
look it's not like i'm coming after

427
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,480
[ __ ] you just can't afford to

428
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:09,120
transition or don't have the social

429
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,639
support

430
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,160
it's not like baltimore's doing

431
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:13,759
everything he can to pass

432
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:15,519
and people just treat him like a freak

433
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:19,279
for no reason hey

434
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:23,839
it's they are we really saying they now

435
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:26,480
in private yes we are so get used to it

436
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:28,560
my name is justine i think misgendering

437
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,600
is toxic because i care about people's

438
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,759
feelings

439
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,040
ugh i always forget that you're like

440
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:34,639
actually an sjw

441
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:36,880
i always forget that you're actually an

442
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:39,199
[ __ ] why do i even hang out with you

443
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:40,560
oh because you hate yourself and you

444
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:41,680
have to believe there's hope for me

445
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,720
because if there's hope for me there

446
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:45,120
might be hope for you

447
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:47,279
wow you're developing self-consciousness

448
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:50,480
where'd you learn that trick

449
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:52,639
gigi tiffany

450
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:54,079
have you ever been bullied oh let's see

451
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:56,959
let me think

452
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:58,720
oh only k-12 nine hours a day but you

453
00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:00,480
don't see me going on talk shows to play

454
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,920
the victim no i see you going on talk

455
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,759
shows to play the bully

456
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,839
i think you grew up getting bullied for

457
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:06,720
being a [ __ ] till you started passing

458
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:08,480
as a woman

459
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,400
and then you got a little taste of

460
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,839
normal and now you want to be the one

461
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:14,079
who bashes the queers

462
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:15,439
bash them if anything i'm the one

463
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:17,280
defending trans people from

464
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:18,240
appropriation and misrepresentation by

465
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,799
these trenders

466
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,839
you said on air that baltimore grosses

467
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:24,079
you out

468
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:25,520
do you really expect me to believe that

469
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:26,880
your motivations here have

470
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,160
nothing to do with your own

471
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,000
self-loathing how could it be

472
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,559
self-loathing when baltimore is

473
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,080
nothing like me okay then it's just

474
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:36,559
bigotry that's even worse

475
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:38,559
oh it's not bigotry look i shouldn't

476
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:41,120
have said gross doubt i'll give you that

477
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:42,000
but he does they do make me

478
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:44,559
uncomfortable

479
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,640
and why do you think that is ugh i got

480
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:47,840
secondhand dysphoria looking at someone

481
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,160
so

482
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:51,919
burgeoning ugh it makes me want to down

483
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,360
a bottle of hormones make sure i never

484
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:54,799
look like that [ __ ] secondhand

485
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,320
dysphoria what is that

486
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:58,320
you know when you look at a tree and you

487
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:01,600
just clock everything

488
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:02,559
and you feel like sympathetic vibrations

489
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,240
of dysphoria

490
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:05,840
yeah i do know what you're talking about

491
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,360
and i'll tell you why it happens

492
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:09,280
when you're early in your transition and

493
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:11,600
you're doing everything you can to pass

494
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:13,360
you develop a really sophisticated eye

495
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,320
for every little thing that makes you

496
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:17,200
clockable

497
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,760
then you turn that sophisticated eye

498
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,240
onto

499
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:22,720
other trans people and you project your

500
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:25,280
dysphoria onto them i buy that

501
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,880
yeah well that is absolutely not a valid

502
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,000
reason to please other trans people's

503
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,640
presentation

504
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,919
secondhand dysphoria is not valid the

505
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:34,559
fact that you project

506
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:35,120
your dysphoria onto other people is your

507
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:37,200
problem

508
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,799
and your problem alone and you need to

509
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,559
deal with that issue in private girl not

510
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:44,080
on a [ __ ] talk show

511
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:45,760
yeah you're probably right about that

512
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,760
but it still doesn't make baltimore

513
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:50,640
maryland any more valid

514
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:52,720
tiffany let's be pragmatic about this

515
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,559
suppose everything you're saying is true

516
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:56,880
suppose the only real trans people are

517
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:58,880
dysphoric binary transgender people

518
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:01,600
transsexuals every time you say the word

519
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:03,600
transsexual i feel like it's 1978.

520
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:06,799
are you 80 years old i guess you could

521
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:08,640
say i'm not the trendiest person

522
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:10,160
look suppose you're right and everyone

523
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,200
who doesn't meet your definition of a

524
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,360
transsexual

525
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,559
is some kind of confused trend follower

526
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,720
even if that were true

527
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:17,679
and to be clear it isn't what you're

528
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,120
doing harms

529
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:21,200
even the trans people you think are

530
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,880
valid because virtually every trans

531
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,320
person goes through a period of being

532
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,320
confused about their gender

533
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,840
and of having non-conforming expression

534
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:29,280
and you're going around enforcing a

535
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,880
stigma against that

536
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:33,200
didn't you ever have doubts about your

537
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:35,440
gender weren't you ever androgynous

538
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,320
oh yeah i mean i was never that

539
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,240
burgeoning but

540
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:41,200
i had my little cringier being a

541
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:42,480
non-binary sjw

542
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:45,039
and one of the great things about

543
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:47,280
non-binary identities is they give trans

544
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:48,960
people the conceptual space to exist

545
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,559
even when neither gender really fits

546
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,720
them whether that's for their entire

547
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:54,320
life or just for a couple months

548
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:56,400
hasn't it occurred to you that being

549
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:58,799
shamed and berated for being a trender

550
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,320
during your exploration year might not

551
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:03,280
have been the most helpful thing

552
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:05,280
not really i have dysphoria so if anyone

553
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:06,080
called me a trender i'd eventually prove

554
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,760
them wrong

555
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:09,679
that's all i'm saying if you're not a

556
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:12,080
trender then transition

557
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:13,280
prove me wrong the stigma you perpetuate

558
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,559
against gender confusion and

559
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,240
experimentation

560
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:17,679
keeps trans people in the closet and

561
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,600
delays transition

562
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:22,000
it alienates baby trans from the

563
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:24,559
community that should be welcoming them

564
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,480
instead of publicly humiliating them and

565
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:28,640
when you appoint yourself the public

566
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,559
decider of whomsed is really trans

567
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:32,000
the torquemada of the trender

568
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:33,760
inquisition you're

569
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,600
terrorizing a lot of people who are

570
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,080
genuinely trying to figure themselves

571
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:39,120
out

572
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:40,480
okay but then how do we decide which

573
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,640
trainees are valid

574
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:45,200
we don't but this is where i'm losing

575
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,760
you because transtrenders are absolutely

576
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,080
a thing

577
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:49,760
like undeniably i've talked to people

578
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,799
who've literally told me they used to be

579
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:53,679
trans trenders

580
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:55,679
so some people question their gender but

581
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:57,760
end up deciding they're not really trans

582
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:59,280
there is nothing wrong with that and

583
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,600
those people still aren't being helped

584
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,200
by

585
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:03,600
public shaming well maybe they wouldn't

586
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,480
be confused in the first place if sjws

587
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,000
weren't going around

588
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:08,159
telling people they don't need dysphoria

589
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,760
to be trans you know it's one thing if

590
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:11,679
teenage girls want to dye their hair

591
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:13,200
pink and call themselves demi boys for

592
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:14,640
most of sophomore year

593
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,480
but some of these kids are actually

594
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,559
going to medically transition and

595
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:20,240
soon we're going to have an epidemic of

596
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:21,840
detransitioners on our hands

597
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,840
and there's going to be turfs publishing

598
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:25,039
i told you so op-eds in every major

599
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:27,039
newspaper

600
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:28,640
now maybe you think that's worth it just

601
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:30,559
to make sure no one ever feels

602
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:33,360
invalidated for any reason

603
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:33,679
but i think that's highly irresponsible

604
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,280
look

605
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:36,720
if you're so worried about people

606
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,520
feeling pressured to medically

607
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,200
transition

608
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,559
then what you should be doing is working

609
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,960
to make the trans community

610
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:44,799
as inclusive and welcoming as possible

611
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,880
to gender non-conforming people

612
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:48,559
and non-binary people and people who are

613
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,760
questioning and trans people who don't

614
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:52,000
medically transition

615
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,799
but instead you're doing the exact

616
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,240
opposite

617
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:56,480
you're telling everyone that medical

618
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:58,240
transition is the only way to be valid

619
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:59,919
and if anything is pressuring people to

620
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:02,880
medically transition

621
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:03,760
it's that justine i think you're a good

622
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,840
person

623
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:07,919
maybe too good and that's why you're

624
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:09,840
trying to have compassion for everyone

625
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:12,320
but at some point you have to protect

626
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:14,000
yourself we live in a world of jackie

627
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,559
jackson's who don't understand trans

628
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,640
people

629
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:18,480
and don't think we're real so we need to

630
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:20,480
have an explanation of what it is to be

631
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:22,799
trans that's based on facts

632
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,600
and not feelings and the most factual

633
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:26,000
explanation

634
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:27,280
is transmedicalism which is the idea

635
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,280
that transsexualism

636
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:30,400
is a diagnosable mental disorder called

637
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:32,320
gender dysphoria

638
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:34,159
there's science to back this up it's

639
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:36,960
accepted by medical professionals

640
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:37,520
and it clearly explains why we are valid

641
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,760
unlike

642
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:41,919
rachel dolezal and snowflake gender

643
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,559
teenagers and people who identify as

644
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:45,440
cats

645
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:47,440
okay i see the appeal but i don't think

646
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,320
transmedicalism is as validating as you

647
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:51,280
think it is

648
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:53,120
why not i'll put it bluntly why does

649
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:54,880
having gender dysphoria make you a woman

650
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:56,080
because gender dysphoria means i have a

651
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:58,400
female brain

652
00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:00,480
no it doesn't i'm sorry to tell you but

653
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,200
the science does not say what you think

654
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,799
it says

655
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,320
there may be neurological causes of

656
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:06,640
gender dysphoria

657
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:09,039
but at the end of the day all dysphoria

658
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:10,799
is is discomfort in a male body or a

659
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:11,679
male social role or however you want to

660
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:14,559
put it

661
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:15,440
and wanting to be a woman is not the

662
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:19,200
same thing

663
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:20,640
as being a woman not by any means

664
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,320
girl where are you going with this what

665
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,679
is this are you becoming a turf no i

666
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:25,840
just don't think your theory

667
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:26,799
actually validates our womanhood well if

668
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:29,280
you're right

669
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:30,080
that's a real problem because we need to

670
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,320
have reason

671
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:34,720
and science and logic and facts on our

672
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:37,120
side so that we can explain to society

673
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:39,360
that we are valid and that we are real

674
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:41,360
otherwise

675
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,480
bad things well maybe there's a better

676
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:44,960
theory well

677
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,760
okay socrates let's hear it then the way

678
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,919
i see it

679
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:48,880
gender is either psychological or

680
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:52,000
biological

681
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:52,559
or social now my friend tabby the cat

682
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,559
girl

683
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:56,000
she thinks it's all psychological that

684
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:57,520
it's just identity

685
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,080
that whatever you think about your own

686
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:02,480
gender is true and that makes me

687
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:04,000
really uncomfortable because then what's

688
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,559
the difference between identifying as a

689
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,880
woman

690
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:09,520
and identifying as a norwegian forest

691
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:11,440
cat it's a difference that tabby herself

692
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,559
seems not to have much of a grip on girl

693
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:14,080
that's literally what i've been trying

694
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:15,760
to tell you about trans trenders this

695
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:17,919
entire time just let me finish

696
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:19,760
if gender is strictly biological then

697
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:21,600
that's game over for trans people

698
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:23,440
unless you make some kind of wrong brain

699
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,799
in the wrong body argument but i told

700
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,559
you i'm not buying that

701
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:28,240
so that leaves gender as a social

702
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:30,320
construct are you gonna try to make me

703
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,799
read judith butler again i'll summarize

704
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:33,200
it

705
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:34,720
gender is a series of gestures it's

706
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,559
called performativity

707
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:38,159
it's the way you dress it's the way you

708
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:40,400
speak it's the way you act

709
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:41,600
it's the way you relate to other people

710
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,200
through transitioning

711
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,960
we habituate to the gestures of

712
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,880
womanhood and socially

713
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:48,559
that makes us women regardless of

714
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:51,760
biology or psychology

715
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:51,760
checkmate transphobe

716
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:56,240
okay the problem with that is that it's

717
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:58,880
both too exclusionary

718
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:00,640
and too inclusive it excludes a lot of

719
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,919
trans people who can't transition for

720
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:04,559
circumstantial reasons

721
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:05,279
but whose dysphoria is very real and it

722
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:08,240
includes

723
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:10,320
every transtrender drag queen fetishist

724
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:12,320
and two-bit cross-dressing comedian in a

725
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:14,159
dinal wig

726
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:16,000
well do you really believe that a man

727
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:19,760
who plays a woman on stage becomes

728
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,760
just as much of a woman as you and me

729
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:25,840
yes [ __ ] no you don't yeah you're right

730
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:27,039
i'm full of [ __ ] i know you are because

731
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:29,200
you're an sjw

732
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:30,880
and sjws hate performativity theory

733
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,840
almost as much as they hate me well they

734
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,799
only hate it because they don't

735
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,559
understand it

736
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:36,320
they think it invalidates non-binary

737
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:38,159
identities but in fact is the most

738
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:40,000
rational way to explain non-binary

739
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:42,559
identities how can you perform

740
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,320
a non-binary identity simple you learn

741
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:46,559
the rules so you can break them

742
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:47,520
wearing a beard and a dress communicates

743
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:49,520
ambiguity

744
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,960
even the gesture of declaring i am

745
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:53,360
neither a man or a woman

746
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:55,200
is a speech act that removes the speaker

747
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:56,960
from the semantics girl shut up

748
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,240
this is too much philosophizing i can't

749
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,440
stand it anymore

750
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:01,200
why don't you tell me what's really

751
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:02,880
going on with you why do you look like

752
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,559
you've been in a k-hole for a week

753
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:07,760
why are you suddenly so obsessed with

754
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:10,960
white knighting for non-binary people

755
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:13,840
because i am non-binary no you're not

756
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:14,720
what are you talking about i just feel

757
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,320
like

758
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:18,480
since i started transitioning i've been

759
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:21,120
trying so hard to fit in

760
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:23,039
and to perform my gender and to pass and

761
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:25,279
to just be normal

762
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:26,480
but i can't do it anymore i just cannot

763
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:28,880
make it work

764
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,840
i feel like an actor i feel like a

765
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,440
zombie like i'm

766
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:33,600
going through the motions of this new

767
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:35,600
general that's supposed to liberate me

768
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,640
but that's somehow just as empty as the

769
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,720
old one

770
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,840
because i'm just not normal tiffany i'm

771
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,360
a freak

772
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:44,640
and i'm always going to be a freak

773
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:47,279
justine you're not non-binary you're gay

774
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:48,240
and everyone can see this except you oh

775
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:51,679
come on

776
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:54,960
i'm not i'm not gay

777
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:57,760
justine was extremely gay

778
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:58,559
protest though there simply is no

779
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:04,000
stopping

780
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:08,400
us i love cat girls

781
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:11,840
i hate talent girls but i also love them

782
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:14,080
oh abominable fate okay

783
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:15,360
so i'm a little bit gay right and you

784
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,960
don't know how to reconcile your

785
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,159
attraction to women with your desire to

786
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:21,440
reform your gender

787
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:23,279
that's why you feel this dissonance yeah

788
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:24,720
i guess that's basically it well it

789
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:26,320
really shouldn't be that hard girl

790
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:28,240
you already came out as a woman just

791
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:31,520
blurted out say

792
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:34,080
hello world my name is justine and i

793
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:34,640
[ __ ] [ __ ] that's a very cis-normative

794
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:38,559
way to

795
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:39,279
say it hello world my name is justine

796
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:43,200
and

797
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:43,760
i a [ __ ] [ __ ] oh i feel like a man when

798
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,360
i say it

799
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:47,840
yeah well you should probably buy a

800
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:49,760
pickup truck then get some of those mud

801
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:51,200
flaps on the back with the little sexy

802
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,720
ladies on them and

803
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,399
you may as well change your name back to

804
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:56,399
justin okay well

805
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:58,480
that's just uncalled for crow i don't

806
00:27:56,399 --> 00:28:00,960
know what to say except i told you so

807
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:03,200
sexuality is just like gender identity

808
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:04,399
it is not a performance it's not a trend

809
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,399
it's not a choice

810
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:10,159
it's just part of who you are and

811
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:10,159
there's nothing you can do to change it

812
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,679
i guess you're right i guess my theory

813
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:16,399
sucks it sucks

814
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:18,399
so [ __ ] hard but the good news is you

815
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:19,919
can unclench your [ __ ] now and do

816
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:21,200
whatever you want because you're still a

817
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:22,799
woman whether you're performing a

818
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:26,640
stereotype or not

819
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:29,039
so run free justine go top assist woman

820
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:30,000
bang a gay guy wear some oversized

821
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:32,880
flannel

822
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,399
do whatever you want wow yeah i guess i

823
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:37,360
guess that is pretty liberating

824
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:37,919
yeah thank god for transmedicalism right

825
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,760
oh

826
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:41,840
except not because you just destroyed

827
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:44,159
transmedicalism with facts and logic

828
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:44,960
so we have no theory we have no theory

829
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:46,880
justine

830
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:48,799
what do we do now how do we prove we're

831
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:50,320
valid well just do what every trans

832
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:50,960
woman has done since the beginning of

833
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,880
time

834
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:55,279
go out and [ __ ] the most brutally

835
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:58,159
heterosexual man you can find and

836
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:59,120
be validated and come oh honey i have

837
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:00,559
and i will

838
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:02,640
but that's not going to convince anyone

839
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:05,679
but me it's not a proof

840
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:06,240
some theory well maybe we don't need a

841
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:08,480
theory

842
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:10,240
maybe we don't need to prove anything

843
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:12,159
bad things just seen

844
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:13,919
bad things well do we have a theory

845
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:16,720
about why people are gay

846
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:18,399
no they just are the only reason we even

847
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,960
feel like we need a theory about trans

848
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:21,600
people

849
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:23,200
is that society is so unaccepting of us

850
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:25,360
that it's constantly demanding we

851
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,880
justify our own reality okay

852
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:28,799
so what am i supposed to tell jackie

853
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,600
jackson then what am i supposed to tell

854
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:32,720
the turfs

855
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:33,520
that i'm a woman because reasons no not

856
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:36,159
even because

857
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:38,080
reasons just because you are so it's

858
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:39,679
what a leap of faith

859
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:42,080
oh great i'm sure that's going to

860
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:44,159
convince all the rational skeptics

861
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,360
justine it makes us sound completely

862
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:48,480
delusional well

863
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:49,520
tiffany delusion is what separates us

864
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,960
from the animals

865
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:53,039
who do you think built the pyramids in

866
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:54,799
the cathedrals clearly not people with a

867
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:56,240
perfectly rational worldview

868
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:57,600
but what do you care anyway aren't you

869
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:59,360
the one who thinks being trans is a

870
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:01,200
mental disorder well i wouldn't describe

871
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:02,640
it as the height of sanity

872
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,399
but i would prefer to think that my

873
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:06,240
whole life and identity is based on

874
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:08,880
something i can rationally explain

875
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:11,039
well what are we tiffany men isn't the

876
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:12,640
single most obnoxious thing about men

877
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:15,520
that they think they have to wrap up the

878
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:17,919
entire world in a little rational box

879
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:19,679
maybe the most important things in life

880
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:21,440
can't be logically proved

881
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:22,799
can you logically prove that you love

882
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:25,520
your own children

883
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:27,919
no and the attempt to prove it is as

884
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:30,159
degrading as it is futile

885
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:32,000
maybe gender identity is one of those

886
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:34,320
things okay

887
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,640
but then how do i prove i'm more valid

888
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:37,279
than baltimore maryland and the star

889
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:39,760
genders

890
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:41,760
and the cat people well maybe we should

891
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:43,120
stop getting so caught up in proving our

892
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:45,039
validity to ourselves

893
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:47,200
that we end up being horribly cruel to

894
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:48,640
other people what if we just accept all

895
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,399
the freaks of the world

896
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:52,559
at the end of the day maybe it's just

897
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:54,399
not as important to have logical proofs

898
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:58,240
as it is to be empathetic and

899
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:58,240
