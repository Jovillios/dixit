00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,880
as men i want you to think back to 2016

7
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,960
which

8
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,960
i know in internet years is like halfway

9
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,960
between now and the decline of rome

00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,640

the gays tell me all about it back in

13
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:32,239
2016

14
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,760
the big internet culture war was between

15
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:35,840
feminists on one side

16
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,200
and men's rights activists on the other

17
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,079
whatever happened to that

18
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,200

19
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,520

the men's rights movement has done the

23
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:50,000
fedora and

24
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,480

purchasing uncooked alpha yogurt

possibly be subsisting in a state of

40
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:26,000
psychological balance

heterosexual medicine cabinets

00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:43,520
to be clear i'm not okay either there's

50
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,159
like 15 jars of urine in my refrigerator

51
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,439

yeah that's right women v2 okay get over

53
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:51,520
it i'm so sorry if this offends your

54
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,840
male notions of feminine delicacy but

55
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:57,200
i for one will not be shamed by your

56
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,200
patriarchal [ __ ]

57
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:04,799
you boys you're very rational aren't you

58
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:06,479
ugh i suppose i was too i admit that

59
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,560
these days rationality

60
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:09,759
it's something i struggle with both as a

61
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,000
biological female

62
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:13,760
and as a pisces moon but when i decided

63
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,720
i wanted to make a video for men

64
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:18,879
contra points i started brushing up on

65
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:22,000
my reasoning skills because

66
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:24,080
i want to be so [ __ ] rational

67
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,319
for you so to prepare for this video i

68
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,920
read newton's principia mathematica

69
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:29,360
wittgenstein's tractatus logical

70
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,280
philosophical and of course

71
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,120
the philosophical classic the rational

72
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,280
male by royal caliente

73
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,760
so my mind is well lubricated and i'm

74
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:41,360
ready for what i have no doubt will be a

75
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:44,000
penetrating intellectual

76
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,800
interchange look i want to play by your

77
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,879
rules okay

78
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,800
so there will be no emotions in this

79
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:49,440
video i will present my arguments in

80
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,080
strict

81
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,959
logical form relying only on facts

82
00:02:52,080 --> 00:03:04,159
reason

83
00:02:52,959 --> 00:03:08,080
evidence and deductive proof

84
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:10,810

85
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:16,840

[Music]

89

video

100
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,760
i'm really sorry about all this unless

101
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:04,000
you're into that sort of thing

102
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:06,159
in which case how very dare i'm a good

103
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,239
presbyterian and by presbyterian

104
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:09,920
i do mean pansexual hey how are you look

105
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:12,480
the video is about men so

106
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,280
i'm trying to be attractive to men am i

107
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,560
doing this right

108
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:18,239
is this what men like trap straps

109
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,600
it is a risky look for a girl like me

110
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:20,400
when you do a lingerie look you know

111
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,919
you're going to wind up

112
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,759
somewhere on the front converter violet

113
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:26,400
trotsky devonte's spectrum

114
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,960
oh but you don't know where exactly and

115
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,520
that

116
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,360
is a dangerous game ladies i have to say

117
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,680
though i actually am feeling

118
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,600
pretty [ __ ] empowered right now but

119
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,560
um

120
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,520
that could be because of the drugs look

121
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,280
gentlemen

122
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,919
let's be rational and we're fooling

123
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:47,919
around okay part one

124
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:50,960
oh wait rational axiom one

125
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:52,720
america's next top victim i think there

126
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:55,360
is some truth to the idea

127
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:57,680
that we live in a victimhood culture and

128
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:59,199
i'm not just talking about campus sjws

129
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,039
with their microaggressions

130
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:03,280
no [ __ ] this goes all the way to the

131
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:05,840
top we have white people complaining

132
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,639
about reverse racism we have the literal

133
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:10,280
one percent

134
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:14,000
complaining about anti-bridge

135
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:14,960
prejudice that must be super [ __ ]

136
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,880
hard for you

137
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:19,120
we have the heterosexual agenda

138
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:21,120
organizing straight pride parades

139
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,800
you know flaunting their sexuality in

140
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,759
the faces of children who are trying to

141
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,280
raise a family

142
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:27,600
and protesting in the street like a

143
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,639
bunch of and so of course because there

144
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,800
was women's rights

145
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:32,320
there has to be men's rights too i've

146
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,280
been hearing about men's rights for my

147
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,440
whole adult life

148
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,720
and i've always been very skeptical

149
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,120
because in my experience

150
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,560
online men's rights activism in practice

151
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,639
always looks like this

152
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,680
women try to do a good thing to solve a

153
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:46,080
real problem

154
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,120
and then a man shows up to say well what

155
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,199
about men

156
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,639
men also get harassed why aren't you

157
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:52,800
talking about man

158
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:55,280
and does this man actually involved in

159
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:58,000
activism to stop harassment against men

160
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,960
of course he's [ __ ] not he doesn't

161
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,199
give a [ __ ]

162
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,240
he's a troll his contribution to the

163
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:05,360
conversation

164
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,000
begins and ends with what about man what

165
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,600
about them

166
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,280
honey for this video i decided to

167
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,720
actually do some research for once

168
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,560
and the first thing i did was read the

169
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,360
foundational text of the modern men's

170
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,120
rights movement

171
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,880
which is the myth of male power by

172
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,319
warren farrell actually i listened to

173
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,639
the audiobook because

174
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:21,680
let's be honest reading is hired but as

175
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:23,520
i was listening

176
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,960
i admit i thought it made more sense

177
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,960
than i was expecting it to

178
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,880
basically farrell says that second wave

179
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,479
feminists rightly fought against the

180
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,080
traditional gender role that confined

181
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:34,160
women to domestic servitude

182
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:36,240
but he argues that the feminist idea

183
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,080
that men have all the power in society

184
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,000
is actually an illusion because the

185
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,160
traditional gender role for men

186
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,240
is just as oppressive he introduces the

187
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:47,039
idea of male disposability

188
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:49,120
basically the idea that society values

189
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,960
female lives more than male lives

190
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,800
which are seen as expendable in the

191
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,000
service of protecting and providing for

192
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,840
women and children

193
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,680
and he points to statistics showing that

194
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,560
men make up the majority of military

195
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,479
casualties

196
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,720
workplace fatalities murder victims

197
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:03,440
suicides and so on so we're supposed to

198
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,599
conclude

199
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:07,360
that even though at first it looks like

200
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:10,080
men have more power than women

201
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,400
in fact the queens have a certain kind

202
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,400
of

203
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,800
privilege and being protected and

204
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:17,120
provided for by the expendable male

205
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,120
worker bees and i guess that

206
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,199
kind of makes sense i feel like i can at

207
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:23,919
least empathize with the point of view

208
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:27,280
what i'm saying is i took the red pill

209
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:27,280
and i rubbed it on my claw

210
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:30,720
but some initial objections come to mind

211
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,039
like

212
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:35,440
haven't men been almost all of the kings

213
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:37,199
presidents and ceos for millennia didn't

214
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,680
men make up all these rules in the first

215
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,160
place

216
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,360
i don't know boys still seems kind of

217
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,440
patriarchal to me

218
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,039
but maybe you'll say that it's only at

219
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,960
the top of society

220
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:48,800
that men have more power than women

221
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:51,360
maybe the average man

222
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:53,120
is also oppressed by the system that

223
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,680
feminists call patriarchy

224
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,800
if that's what you're saying i think i

225
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,240
basically agree

226
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,840
with that see what you have to

227
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,800
understand about me is i'm

228
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:04,800
such a [ __ ] libra whenever there's a

229
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:07,039
conflict my gut reaction is to be like

230
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,879
well maybe everybody's right and maybe

231
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:10,800
there's good points on both sides and we

232
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:14,720
should all just listen to each other and

233
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:16,879
rub each other's claws but yo

234
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,759
my scorpio rising persona will not allow

235
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:19,919
that oh

236
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:22,000
there will be a champion there will be

237
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:24,720
blood so

238
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,400
judges how do we decide which gender is

239
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,960
america's next top victim

240
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:31,680
i mean it's not like you can just change

241
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:35,279
genders and see how the other half lives

242
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:38,959
or can you proposition 2

243
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:41,440
diary of an x-man dear diary

244
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:45,200
with every false smile i can feel that

245
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:48,720
on the inside i'm drowning in darkness

246
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,519
mom get out of my room oh you're ruining

247
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:53,040
my life

248
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:54,399
look i've never ever talked about this

249
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,240
on my channel before so

250
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:57,760
this is like a super [ __ ] vulnerable

251
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:00,880
moment for me but

252
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,839
i was born a boy well was i ever really

253
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:05,040
a boy

254
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:06,640
it's hard to say dear diary growing up i

255
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,440
always knew that i was different from

256
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:10,800
other kids

257
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:13,760
especially other boys and it took me so

258
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,720
long to pinpoint what it was but there

259
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,279
was this

260
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,160
moment i must have been what seven eight

261
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:20,080
years old

262
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:21,279
and i was playing in my parents room all

263
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:24,320
by myself

264
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:25,760
and i saw this pair of my mom's shoes

265
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,760
lying on the floor

266
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:30,800
and i don't know what it was it was like

267
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:32,800
this magnetism that drew me to them

268
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,320
and i put my little feet in them and

269
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,880
walked in front of the mirror

270
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,480
and i didn't really have the words yet

271
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:41,600
to describe how i felt

272
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:44,720
but basically in that moment i

273
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:48,839
sensed that god had made a mistake and

274
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:51,120
i was destined to be to be a

275
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:53,600
cross-dresser

276
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,680
that is super [ __ ] coconuts anyway

277
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,200
then in my 20s my life completely fell

278
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,680
apart and i became a woman hey how are

279
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,320
you

280
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:01,440
i became one of the dolls my plastic

281
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,040
surgeon is an artist

282
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,920
look boys the point i'm trying to make

283
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:07,360
here is i used to live your lifestyle

284
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:09,200
i know what people like you get up to

285
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,680
and i think it's disgusting

286
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,279
i gotta say though since i transitioned

287
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,920
my life has been super [ __ ] great

288
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,600
like

289
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,120
way better now of course a lot of that

290
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,079
is not because women have it better than

291
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:21,480
men but

292
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:22,959
because hey gorge i am literally

293
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:24,880
transgendered

294
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:27,279
so before i transitioned i was dying

295
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:30,480
inside you know i was in the wrong body

296
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:32,480
and now it's like i finally have the

297
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,800
body i was meant to die inside of

298
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,920
but it's not just that i do think that

299
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,600
in some ways

300
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,680
since i started presenting as a woman

301
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,360
people actually do treat me better

302
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,200
i mean they take my opinions less

303
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,519
seriously sure but

304
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,360
that's probably for the best now before

305
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,320
using my personal experience as any kind

306
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,240
of evidence

307
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,839
i guess i should say a couple caveats

308
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,000
caveat one is that

309
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:55,360
most pre-transitioned trans women are

310
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,800
not like other boys

311
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,880
and most of us we're not living the

312
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:01,120
business class male experience by

313
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:03,600
any means you know it's a lot of drunk

314
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:06,640
melancholics tormented sissies

315
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:10,640
secretive transvestites poets

316
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:13,600
you know that sort of thing caveat too

317
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:14,000
is that my trans experience is not the

318
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,079
trans

319
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,200
experience and i do have a lot of other

320
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:19,040
privileges that

321
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,640
made things go super [ __ ] well for me

322
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,240
hey how are you don't you just

323
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:24,160
love it when someone checks their

324
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:26,320
privilege in a way that's actually

325
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:28,079
just bragging you know it's super

326
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,240
important for me to acknowledge that

327
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:31,040
i've been so successful and i've come so

328
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,839
far

329
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:35,839
in part because i'm white and i'm skinny

330
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:39,120
and i'm young and i'm blonde

331
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:41,440
and i'm rich and i pass and i'm educated

332
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,320
and i'm popular and my plastic surgeon

333
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,320
is an artist

334
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,480
and my boyfriend is really rich and hot

335
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,160
and i come from a pure aryan bloodline

336
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,680
and part of what makes me so enlightened

337
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,839
and so compassionate

338
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,839
is that i'm able to recognize these

339
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:55,600
privileges that i have that

340
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:58,240
just might not be available to people

341
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,760
who are less fortunate

342
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,200
from the bottom of my [ __ ] at

343
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,920
my father [ __ ] heart that must be

344
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,320
super [ __ ] hard for you i can't even

345
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:06,240
imagine

346
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,680
what i was saying is there are ways that

347
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,880
people treat me better now that i'm

348
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,959
presenting as a woman

349
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:12,639
you know people smile at me more i feel

350
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:15,519
more taken care of

351
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:17,519
men do things for me now a lot of women

352
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:18,000
don't like men doing things for them you

353
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:20,079
know

354
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,120
holding doors helping with luggage

355
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:23,440
because they feel that it's

356
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:26,959
infantilizing or condescending

357
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,600
but not me i love it both because i love

358
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:30,079
attention

359
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,600
and because i'm a recumbent queen who's

360
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,160
too much of a delicate flower to lift a

361
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,839
finger

362
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,279
i do this thing on airplanes where when

363
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:36,959
it's time for me to put my carry-on

364
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:39,120
luggage in the overhead bin

365
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:40,160
i pretend that my bag is too heavy for

366
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,240
me to lift

367
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,279
and then some man will usually get up

368
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,360
and do it for me

369
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:46,399
even though i'm taller than most men it

370
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,760
makes me happy

371
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:50,240
another good thing about becoming a

372
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,880
woman is i integrated into female social

373
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,880
groups

374
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:55,519
and i found that they provide a kind of

375
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:58,079
communal support and overt affection

376
00:12:55,519 --> 00:13:00,000
that male social groups generally just

377
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:01,760
don't i find that female social style

378
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,600
suits me better than the male one

379
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,800
which tends to be more atomized more

380
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,720
individualist

381
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,320
where affection is always concealed

382
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,800
behind this semi-jokey

383
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,320
front of competition like think about

384
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,519
the way boys talk to each other when

385
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,959
they play video games

386
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:16,399
a throne improvement for me has to do

387
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:17,839
with the way men and women are treated

388
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:19,920
in public space

389
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:21,519
when you present female in public you're

390
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:24,720
more likely to be treated as a

391
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:27,200
spectacle to be commented upon people

392
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,399
usually men will just blurt out their

393
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,000
opinions about you

394
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:31,920
sometimes complimentary sometimes

395
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,079
insulting sometimes

396
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,680
just [ __ ] weird whereas when you

397
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:37,120
present mail in public

398
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,440
you're more likely to be treated either

399
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,800
as invisible or as dangerous

400
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,639
now feminists have traditionally

401
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,639
interpreted these differences as

402
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:45,839
men asserting dominance over women in

403
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:47,440
public space

404
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:49,040
and they've criticized cat calling as

405
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,240
being objectifying degrading and

406
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,920
misogynistic

407
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,839
and it certainly can be all of those

408
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,519
things there's different kinds of cat

409
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:56,079
calling and i have different feelings

410
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:58,160
about them

411
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:59,120
if i'm walking with another woman and a

412
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,839
man says

413
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,320
ladies you look beautiful tonight i

414
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:04,800
don't know

415
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:07,040
i like that i think that's nice it makes

416
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:10,079
me feel seen it makes me feel admired

417
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:11,199
it boosts my confidence whereas if i'm

418
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:13,279
walking alone

419
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:14,560
and a drunk starts following me down the

420
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:17,680
street singing

421
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:20,800
have you seen a polythene pam she's so

422
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:24,000
good looking but she looks like a man

423
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:26,240
that i am less enthusiastic about

424
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,079
i mean not that that's ever happened i'm

425
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,880
completely [ __ ] unclockable hey how

426
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:31,700
are you

427
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:34,959
noah

428
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:36,240
[Music]

429
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:38,079
i definitely get where feminists are

430
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,920
coming from because street harassment

431
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:41,519
sucks i'm a lot more afraid walking

432
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,519
alone at night than i used to be

433
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:44,880
and there's a lot more places i just

434
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:47,519
won't go by myself

435
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:49,040
but on the other hand i do now enjoy

436
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,440
being able to walk down the street at

437
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,000
night

438
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,760
without other people acting afraid of me

439
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,120
i think a lot of feminists have failed

440
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:57,040
to imagine the ways

441
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,320
that being treated as invisible or

442
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:01,680
dangerous can

443
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:03,680
also kind of suck in my video on incels

444
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,639
i talked about male invisibility on

445
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:07,199
dating apps

446
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:08,880
and how getting no attention at all can

447
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:10,720
actually be emotionally worse

448
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,079
than getting a lot of shitty attention

449
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:15,600
and when it comes to being treated

450
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:18,079
as dangerous when i was living as a man

451
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,839
sometimes if i was walking at night a

452
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:22,079
woman on the same block as me

453
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:23,360
would change sides of the street and i

454
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:25,279
totally get why

455
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,399
men do scary [ __ ] sometimes and it's

456
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:28,959
better to be safe

457
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:29,680
but it's still stung a little bit to be

458
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:32,399
treated as

459
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,759
dangerous by default i think it can

460
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,680
actually be harmful which

461
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:38,240
becomes clearer if we add race into the

462
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,720
equation there's ways that white women's

463
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,959
fear

464
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,079
can actually be dangerous in particular

465
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:43,680
to black men

466
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,800
i had an experience with this recently

467
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,800
when i was filming my video the

468
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,920
apocalypse and i'd rented a room in a

469
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,440
hotel casino

470
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:51,199
around midnight i was carrying some

471
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,800
camera equipment up to my room

472
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:54,480
and i got into the elevator with a group

473
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,399
of people from the casino floor

474
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:58,399
a couple floors up everyone got out of

475
00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:01,279
the elevator except for me

476
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:02,160
and a single black man well i mean he

477
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,440
was alone

478
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,639
i don't know if he was single that's not

479
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,440
part of the story and as soon as the

480
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:07,519
door closed

481
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,880
he started literally whistling row row

482
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:10,720
row your boat

483
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,560
the official melody of performative

484
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:16,079
innocence and i realized

485
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:18,160
oh [ __ ] he is afraid that i'm afraid

486
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:20,240
and i found that just excruciating i was

487
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:22,000
like oh god

488
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,920
how do other white women behave in

489
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,279
elevators do they like

490
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:30,079
clutch their purses ugh

491
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:30,720
that's so funny embarrassing nothing

492
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:32,160
like that had

493
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,480
ever happened to me when i was living as

494
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:35,440
a man it's not a thing between black men

495
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,680
and white men

496
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,839
it's a thing between black men and white

497
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:41,519
women and so that dynamic was there

498
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:43,680
not just because i'm white and he's

499
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:45,519
black but because i'm a woman

500
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:47,360
and he's a man and i thought of that

501
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:48,800
incident again when i was listening to

502
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:51,360
the myth of male power

503
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:53,120
and pharaoh says men's greatest weakness

504
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:55,199
is their facade of strength

505
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,560
and women's greatest strength is their

506
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:58,639
facade of weakness

507
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:00,639
i think there is some truth to the idea

508
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:01,920
that women's perceived vulnerability can

509
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:04,160
make them powerful

510
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,760
and men's perceived power can make them

511
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,520
vulnerable now i hope you're taking all

512
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:09,120
this with a grain of salt because

513
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,480
these are just some little observations

514
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:11,360
i've made based on a handful of

515
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,919
anecdotes

516
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:14,959
and as rational males it's important

517
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:18,160
that we consider

518
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:18,959
the facts the stats and the figures did

519
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:22,079
you know

520
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:25,280
that 46 of men are at least

521
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:28,799
2.8 times different than 73

522
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:31,039
of women look it up i haven't i guess my

523
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:32,960
super [ __ ] libra opinion is that

524
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:34,240
there's upsides and downsides to male

525
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,760
and female experience

526
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,919
i don't actually think there's a single

527
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,400
definite answer to the vague and useless

528
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:40,640
question

529
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,080
which gender has it worse i consider

530
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,760
myself a feminist because

531
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:45,440
i support reproductive rights and i

532
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:47,440
oppose workplace misogyny

533
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,200
and i generally agree with a lot of the

534
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,080
activism that happens under the heading

535
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,160
of feminism

536
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,840
but i also think a lot of men are just

537
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,520
having a super [ __ ] difficult time

538
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:57,200
right now and that must be super [ __ ]

539
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,559
hard for them hey are you

540
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:01,679
and i don't think feminists have an

541
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:04,240
obligation to care about male x but

542
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:05,600
i care about you boys god i'm such a

543
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,360
cool girl i think the entire

544
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,760
mid-atlantic region is about to freeze

545
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,520
over

546
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:11,120
now i'm just a super [ __ ] empathetic

547
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,640
pisces moon and

548
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:15,440
i really try to understand other

549
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:18,640
people's pain because

550
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:21,520
i just find it really really funny

551
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:23,039
i'm also really really sobering up here

552
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:26,320
the drugs have worn off

553
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:28,799
and i'm suddenly feeling

554
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,760
very naked like it's just now occurring

555
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:32,080
to me that

556
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:33,360
this is a highly inappropriate outfit

557
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:36,559
for this occasion

558
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:39,120
so i'm gonna go put on a robe and

559
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:40,720
i'll meet you back for the next section

560
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,910
postulate three

561
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:47,650
the man question

562
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:47,650
[Music]

563
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:53,200
hi boys etc etc hey how are you

564
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,400
for the last three years on this channel

565
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:57,440
i have been your

566
00:18:54,400 --> 00:19:00,640
virgil leading you through gender hell

567
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:03,440
pickup artists gender dysphoria in cells

568
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,799
radical feminists non-binary genders

569
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:07,280
men's rights activists

570
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:07,919
it seems like everybody's having gender

571
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,799
trouble

572
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:11,679
so what do we make of that well gorge a

573
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:13,760
very

574
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:15,360
very rational male philosopher named

575
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:17,600
hegel once said

576
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:19,919
that the unfolding of history is a

577
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:22,320
basically rational process gorge

578
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:24,080
that means that at any time in history

579
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:27,679
society is based on certain

580
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:29,200
principles like um all men are created

581
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:30,000
equal as long as there's super [ __ ]

582
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,840
rich and white

583
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,760
and there's always contradictions within

584
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:35,760
those principles which creates

585
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:37,440
tension and eventually leads to a

586
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:39,360
rupture like a revolution

587
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,799
where society has to be reorganized

588
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,320
according to new principles

589
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:43,919
at least i think he was saying something

590
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:45,600
like that it's pretty hard to make

591
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:48,000
anything out through the fog of his

592
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:49,840
unreadable hyper-abstract man-jabbering

593
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,760
god i can't stand that [ __ ]

594
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:53,200
or any of the other music-hating vol

595
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,840
cells of the male philosophical

596
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,679
tradition

597
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:57,520
my point is i think our society has

598
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:58,080
reached a place where gender as we know

599
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,000
it

600
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:01,760
just isn't working anymore now no one

601
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,720
seems to agree why it isn't working or

602
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:05,120
how to fix it

603
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:06,880
but we do all agree that it's broken we

604
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,240
have mainstream feminists saying we need

605
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,720
to continue advancing the rights of

606
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,320
women

607
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,480
we have conservatives saying we need to

608
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:14,080
restore the gender roles of the 1950s

609
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:16,000
we have an increasing number of people

610
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,360
not identifying as men or women

611
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,120
we have turfs who think that the

612
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,240
transgenders are the single greatest

613
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,159
threat to civilization

614
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,600
heihou and we have men's rights

615
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:24,880
activists saying we need a male

616
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,880
equivalent to feminism

617
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:28,880
to liberate men from their oppressive

618
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,760
gender role now i want to focus on that

619
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,960
last one

620
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:34,559
because in principle i agree i've spent

621
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,559
a lot of the last three years covering

622
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:37,919
the manosphere i know such a feminine

623
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:39,360
topic loves that for me

624
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:41,120
and from all the time i've tortured

625
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,080
myself wading through these communities

626
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:44,720
of in-cells

627
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:46,640
pickup artists men's rights slacktivists

628
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,240
intellectual dark web fanboys and

629
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:50,159
alt-right racists

630
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,919
i've noticed that they all have one

631
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:53,440
thing in common which is that they all

632
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:56,720
recruit from the same

633
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:57,760
massive pool of sad young men we all

634
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,840
know the archetype

635
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:01,360
he has trouble relating to women he has

636
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:03,280
no strong friendship group he's not

637
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:05,280
excited about any long-term goals

638
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:07,280
and he fills the void with video games

639
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:09,039
and porn and just to clarify

640
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:10,720
i'm not trying to take away your video

641
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:11,760
games in porn i'm not telling you what

642
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,440
to do with your penis

643
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:15,440
you can rub one out to this video for

644
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:17,600
all i care just don't pull a gamer keyed

645
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:20,159
on me okay

646
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:22,000
i live in fear look i like to believe

647
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:23,039
that until the red pillars inject their

648
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,280
poison

649
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:26,960
most of these boys are not bad people i

650
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:29,360
think all of this originates in a

651
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:30,480
genuine crisis of male identity and i

652
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,919
think it's happened in

653
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:34,400
something like the way men's rights

654
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:35,760
activists describe the sacrificial role

655
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,440
of men as warriors

656
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:39,280
is no longer widely glorified or

657
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,559
necessary the traditional protector

658
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:42,880
provider role of men

659
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:44,559
is being replaced by a more equal and

660
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:46,480
undefined gender dynamic

661
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:48,400
and college professors and activists are

662
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:50,880
telling men that most of our culture's

663
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:52,799
aspirational representations of manhood

664
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,480
are toxic and bad but without an

665
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:56,480
attractive replacement vision of

666
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,080
aspirational manhood

667
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,000
average young men can only envision

668
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:03,280
their future as

669
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,919
what the beta the [ __ ]

670
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:07,600
the new male and in a post-left-tube

671
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:10,400
internet we're so used to laughing at

672
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:12,960
this vocabulary and to be fair it is

673
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,679
very funny but we forgot especially us

674
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,360
grylls

675
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:17,280
that for a lot of men these words

676
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:19,679
actually do tap into a deep

677
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:22,080
existential angst and a lot of leftists

678
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:24,000
go well how can men be so angsty

679
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:26,080
especially white men they're so

680
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,720
privileged but existential angst

681
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:30,400
is often a disease of privilege if

682
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:32,159
you're actually being oppressed

683
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:34,159
you have a struggle you have something

684
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:36,720
to fight for and therefore

685
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:38,960
a purpose but for a lot of men their

686
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:41,520
lack of purpose puts them in search

687
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:43,280
of a struggle and that along with the

688
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,320
loneliness and the lack of a positive

689
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,919
identity

690
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:47,840
is what makes men vulnerable to

691
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:50,159
recruitment by the manosphere groups

692
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:52,159
and by the alt-right and even worse it

693
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:54,320
seems to be a motivating factor for the

694
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:56,640
small but growing number of young men

695
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:58,159
who decide to pick up a gun and open

696
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,760
fire in a shopping center

697
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:01,600
there were two mass shootings during the

698
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:03,919
weekend i was writing this video

699
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:05,120
resulting in 31 deaths both shooters

700
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:06,960
were young white men

701
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:08,799
and one of them posted about the

702
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:10,159
shooting on an alt-right image board now

703
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:11,600
i don't pretend to fully understand the

704
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:13,440
motives of mass shooters

705
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:15,440
but i don't think it's a coincidence

706
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:17,360
that basically all of them are men

707
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,480
one possible interpretation of the mass

708
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:20,320
shooting epidemic

709
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,080
is that these killers are trying to

710
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:24,480
resurrect some horrible

711
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:25,200
parody of ancient masculine glory and

712
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:28,240
therefore

713
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:30,640
to be seen and recognized as men

714
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,760
by unleashing homeric violence in a

715
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:33,600
[ __ ] walmart

716
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,799
and of course there's also the racism of

717
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,640
the alt-right killers

718
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:37,840
and the wounded sexual entitlement of

719
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,679
the incel killers

720
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:41,360
but that racism and that sexual

721
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:43,279
entitlement are learned

722
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:45,919
and men in the throes of a masculinity

723
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:48,240
crisis are more receptive to learning it

724
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:50,080
so you can try to take down their forums

725
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,279
and ban their accounts and de-platform

726
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:53,679
their events

727
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:55,120
but as long as this male identity crisis

728
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:57,919
goes on

729
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:59,200
i don't see any end to these problems

730
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:02,240
theorem four

731
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:04,159
what do there is this median narrative

732
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,480
that has emerged around me and around

733
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:06,159
this

734
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,919
channel and by the way the fact that

735
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:09,039
there's any kind of media narrative

736
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:11,760
about this channel

737
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:13,039
is super [ __ ] coconuts because let's

738
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,799
be real gorge

739
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:16,240
i just wanted to pour milk on my face

740
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:18,000
and talk about the mouth feel but

741
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:21,520
there's this immediate narrative that my

742
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:25,440
role in the discourse is de-radicalizing

743
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:27,440
young alt-right men and it's true

744
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:30,080
that if you read the leftist youtube fan

745
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:32,240
subreddits i used to be alt-right posts

746
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:34,559
are so common they're considered cliche

747
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:36,640
and some of them cite me as an influence

748
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:39,279
in changing their politics which

749
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:40,240
i love for them and i'm super very happy

750
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:43,520
about it but

751
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:47,039
it's also a lot of responsibility

752
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:49,600
they're my boys and i worry about

753
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:51,279
my boys because in reality it's not like

754
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,720
they go from far-right extremists to

755
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:55,279
complacent centrists

756
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:57,600
no most of them go far left a lot of

757
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:59,520
them become communists or anarchists

758
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:01,600
so i watch them go from far to my right

759
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:03,360
to significantly to my left

760
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:05,360
it's not really de-radicalizing so much

761
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:06,080
as re-radicalizing and i think it's

762
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:08,400
definitely an

763
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:09,440
improvement but i still worry it's not

764
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:12,400
going to be enough

765
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:14,080
i worry about my boys because i don't

766
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:16,640
think that the left yet has

767
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,440
a final solution to the man question oh

768
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:19,279
no

769
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:21,039
that was worded poorly you know there's

770
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:21,760
kind of two options the left has for

771
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:24,320
disillusioned

772
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:25,679
men the first is the marxist promise of

773
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:27,840
economic revolution

774
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:29,520
we say well actually yes you are

775
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:30,480
oppressed but you're oppressed because

776
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,080
of your class

777
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,919
not your gender so just join the

778
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,640
revolution it's gonna be super [ __ ]

779
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:36,159
crazy

780
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:38,000
we're gonna overthrow the bourgeoisie

781
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:40,799
meow meow smash

782
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,520
no voting and then things will be better

783
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:42,960
for you

784
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:44,960
now i think that has a couple

785
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:47,760
limitations one

786
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:49,200
is that i look at the far left and i see

787
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:51,039
a bunch of people who spend all their

788
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:53,039
time accusing each other of abusing

789
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:53,600
moderator privileges in closed facebook

790
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:57,600
groups

791
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:59,919
and i'm concerned that might not succeed

792
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:01,840
at ending capitalism meow meow

793
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:04,080
like definitely vote for bernie sanders

794
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:06,080
or elizabeth warren or whoever but

795
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:08,320
if you're investing all of your hopes in

796
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:10,080
a capital r revolution

797
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:12,320
i worry that can become like waiting for

798
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:14,880
godot or waiting for the rapture

799
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:15,760
so we do need political change but i

800
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,880
feel like i'm

801
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:19,919
failing my boys if i'm somehow giving

802
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,919
them the idea that

803
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:23,039
revolution is their only hope because

804
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:25,760
here's the other thing

805
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:27,039
even if we did succeed ending capitalism

806
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:30,159
there would still be gender

807
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:32,559
and my boys would still need some model

808
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:33,279
of what it is to lead a good life as a

809
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:34,720
man

810
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:36,480
now the other option the left has for

811
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:39,039
disillusioned men is

812
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:41,039
the feminist tranquilizer we say look

813
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:42,880
toxic masculinity is the reason you

814
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:44,400
don't have room to express your feelings

815
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:46,799
and it's the reason you feel lonely and

816
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:48,400
inadequate so while feminism tells women

817
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:50,240
you hate your body and you're constantly

818
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:52,960
doubting yourself because society

819
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:54,559
did this to you and needs to change we

820
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,919
kind of just tell men

821
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:57,600
you're lonely and suicidal because

822
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:59,440
you're toxic stop it

823
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,720
we tell them they're broken without

824
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,600
really telling them how to fix

825
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:04,320
themselves

826
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:06,000
i think what we need is a new positive

827
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:07,360
ideal of manhood

828
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,039
which i don't think is something that

829
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:10,960
women can create for men

830
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:12,240
even if they wanted to and honestly the

831
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,840
best way for that to happen

832
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:16,240
may actually be some kind of men's

833
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:17,919
movement but on the left the whole idea

834
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:20,240
of a men's movement is basically

835
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:22,320
taboo because the men's movement we all

836
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:23,039
know is basically just a backlash to

837
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:25,279
feminism

838
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:26,159
and at worst it's just straight up

839
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:28,320
misogyny

840
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:30,159
and look boys i understand that being

841
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:31,120
lectured about man spreading for most of

842
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:32,880
2015

843
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:35,039
was super [ __ ] hard for you and

844
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:37,279
you're still mad about it but

845
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:40,000
posting endless outrage porn about false

846
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:41,520
rape accusations and paternity fraud

847
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,360
isn't actually gonna make life any

848
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:44,960
better for you because yes

849
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:47,120
those things are horrible when they

850
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:49,360
happen but they're not systemic

851
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:50,640
issues that affect most men i think what

852
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:54,159
would actually improve

853
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:56,240
life for most men is a positive ideal of

854
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:58,399
21st century manhood

855
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:00,880
but that's not something i can give to

856
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:03,279
you because in case you hadn't noticed

857
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:04,799
i'm literally a [ __ ] woman i can't

858
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:05,520
mom you through this one boys you're on

859
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:07,919
your own

860
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:09,440
you have to help each other so find each

861
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:11,760
other in the comments section

862
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,480
meet up on reddit make friends clean

863
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:15,120
your room

864
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:15,600
leave the house [ __ ] each other i don't

865
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:19,679
know

866
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:19,679
it's worth a try and failing that

867
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:23,360
you could always throw in the towel and

868
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:31,840
become a woman

869
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:31,840
worked for me

870
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:45,840
[Music]

00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:13,840
so

876
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:22,960
[Music]

877
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:24,480

naked right now that's crazy

882
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:35,279
that's super [ __ ] crazy uh according

883
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:37,440
to traditional gender roles

884
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:39,120
men are useful for their labor and women

885
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:41,440
are useful for their wounds

886
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:42,559
well i'm a woman without a womb so i

887
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:44,880
guess i'm useless

888
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:46,159
but i'm beautifully useless ah i'm a

889
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,840
work of art

890
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:49,200
the problem with our society is we've

891
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:52,640
turned men into women

892
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:55,039
it's disgusting as an ally to men

893
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:56,799
it's not my place to speak for them or

894
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:59,840
speak over them but

895
00:29:56,799 --> 00:30:03,279
i just want to use my platform to

896
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:08,240
uplift some male voices who

897
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:08,240
might not have as many subscribers as me

898
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:15,279
i'm not hypergamous i don't need a rich

899
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,440

i am a rich man it's not even really

903
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,440
much of an insult being called a

904
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:25,360
delusional man

905
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:28,159
many great books have been written by

906
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:28,159
delusional man

907
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:36,720
