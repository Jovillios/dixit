[Music]

2
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:34,200
stop they like stuff and I want more

3
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:38,160
stuff my child hearken to my voice which

4
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:40,110
is I Socrates oh no what do you want I

5
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,809
haven't seen you at the symposium of

6
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:45,090
late well yeah because you kind of hate

7
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:47,010
women and it was getting me down my

8
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:49,559
child without my guidance you have

9
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:51,300
become a slave to mirror appetite have

10
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:53,190
you forgotten what I've taught you about

11
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:55,289
the true meaning of happiness the

12
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:58,770
rational contemplation of truth and

13
00:00:55,289 --> 00:01:00,930
justice look I tried that and honestly I

14
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:04,019
don't think it's really my thing I'm a

15
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:04,799
dumb-dumb and I like shiny things ah my

16
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:06,600
child

17
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,760
these are pleasures for the pigs

18
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,909
happiness can only be acquired through

19
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:13,770
the contemplation of beauty itself

20
00:01:10,909 --> 00:01:17,400
perfectly exemplified in the supple

21
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:18,840
bodies of young boys okay thank you for

22
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,700
your feedback we'll take that into

23
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:24,350
consideration

24
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:27,930
look Greeks look we all have wants needs

25
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:30,990
desires and we all want happiness but

26
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:33,060
happiness what does that word even mean

27
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:35,159
I'm just a dumb tongue who likes shiny

28
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:37,049
things and these are questions really

29
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:38,759
better left to the philosophers which is

30
00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:41,100
why I'm not going to present my original

31
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:42,720
ideas in this video instead I will be

32
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:45,090
interpreting one of the most influential

33
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:47,880
works of anti-capitalist philosophy ever

34
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:49,979
produced a series in multiple volumes

35
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:51,840
that examines deeply the concept of the

36
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:54,240
fetishism of the commodity I am of

37
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,430
course talking about worth it a series

38
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,409
on BuzzFeed video about three men who

39
00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:00,119
are younger than me who travel the world

40
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:02,969
and try different foods that cost

41
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:05,219
different amounts of money and then say

42
00:02:02,969 --> 00:02:07,200
whether it was worth it in each episode

43
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:08,590
they taste a type of food at three

44
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,450
different restaurants a three

45
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:13,120
drastically different price points to

46
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:15,580
find out which one is the most worth it

47
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:18,370
for example they compare a $2.00 pizza

48
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:22,060
to a $2,000 pizza that's made of gold

49
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:25,239
and a $1 ice cream to a $1,000 ice cream

50
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:28,299
that's made of gold in a $1 bagel to a

51
00:02:25,239 --> 00:02:30,129
$1000 bagel that's made of gold it is a

52
00:02:28,299 --> 00:02:32,140
lot of gold what do I do it than gold on

53
00:02:30,129 --> 00:02:34,750
my fingers a tag on chip renewal now to

54
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:36,910
the untrained eye worth it may seem like

55
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:39,610
insipid YouTube click father but we

56
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:41,560
intellectuals well we have a taste for

57
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:44,980
insights that penetrate a little deeper

58
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:48,849
we like to take it all in ah the worth

59
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:51,549
it boys Andrew Adams demon these are not

60
00:02:48,849 --> 00:02:53,739
new content creators mere actors

61
00:02:51,549 --> 00:02:56,049
dancing monkeys performing for odd

62
00:02:53,739 --> 00:02:58,239
revenue they're philosophers

63
00:02:56,049 --> 00:02:59,530
spiritual leaders even and what they've

64
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:02,019
accomplished on YouTube

65
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:04,239
quite honestly far surpasses the

66
00:03:02,019 --> 00:03:05,379
combined insights of Marx Engels Lenin

67
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:08,430

Kropotkin I've of course read each of

71
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:17,139
these great thinkers Complete Works many

72
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:19,989
many times but I always come away

73
00:03:17,139 --> 00:03:22,329
dissatisfied and I find myself returning

74
00:03:19,989 --> 00:03:25,090
yet again to the unparalleled master

75
00:03:22,329 --> 00:03:27,040
works of Andrew Adam and Steve see each

76
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:30,880
episode of worth it poses to the viewer

77
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:33,010
a fundamental question is it worth it we

78
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:34,989
may never know take for instance the

79
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:37,870
case of the two dollar pizza versus the

80
00:03:34,989 --> 00:03:39,819
2000 dollar gold pizza which is the

81
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:42,310
better deal I mean how would we even

82
00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:44,829
begin to answer such a perplexing riddle

83
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:46,870
well according to Karl Marx the value of

84
00:03:44,829 --> 00:03:49,000
a commodity must be understood in two

85
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:51,370
ways on the one hand there's the youth's

86
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,650
value the commodities capacity to

87
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:56,290
satisfy some human need and on the other

88
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:58,450
hand there is the exchange value the

89
00:03:56,290 --> 00:04:00,549
quantity determining the ratio by which

90
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:02,500
a commodity is exchangeable with every

91
00:04:00,549 --> 00:04:04,450
other commodity deriving from

92
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:07,030
objectified labour over time and

93
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:09,609
expressed in terms of price so let's not

94
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:11,799
oversimplify things clearly and true

95
00:04:09,609 --> 00:04:14,440
Adam and Steve are inviting us the

96
00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:15,860
viewers of worth it to understand the

97
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:18,200
use value exchange

98
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:20,980
value dichotomy not as a mere

99
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:24,320
hierarchical binary but as a sort of

100
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:26,240
delusion rhizome a non arborescent

101
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:28,370
multiplicity with as many sinuous

102
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,530
interconnections as the truffles on the

103
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:32,540
pizza itself am I making myself clear

104
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:34,580
I'm not it's almost as if the

105
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:36,380
philosophers are simply burdening me

106
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:38,390
with jargon and not actually helping me

107
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:41,330
think through this any better so let's

108
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:42,530
throw philosophy in the trash and start

109
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:54,530
over from the beginning

110
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:55,220
foxes I like stuff and I like shiny

111
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:56,600
things

112
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:58,700
now that's something everyone can

113
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:00,890
understand so let's take that as the

114
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:03,470
first axiom of the economic theory I'll

115
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:05,330
be developing in this video so given

116
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:07,700
that I like stuff and I like shiny

117
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:11,150
things let's return to the question is a

118
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:13,970
2000 dollar pizza worth it well it is

119
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:17,600
covered in gold and gold is shiny so I

120
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:19,850
do like that but the pizza itself seems

121
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:22,160
kind of gross it's got squid ink dough

122
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:24,800
smeared with foie gras Stilton cheese

123
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:27,440
black truffles gold flakes and caviar

124
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:29,390
these flavors are overwhelming and they

125
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,800
don't make any sense together the only

126
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:32,810
thing they have in common is being

127
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:35,030
really expensive and it's like the

128
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:36,950
culinary equivalent of Donald Trump's

129
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:39,140
apartment but Andrew and Stephen sit

130
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:41,180
there with New York's financial district

131
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:43,070
for a backdrop and they try to pretend

132
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:45,640
that the pizza doesn't taste like gold

133
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:45,640
and shed

134
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:50,580
I'm honestly speechless I feel weird is

135
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:52,740
it the gold

136
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:54,540
I just ate two hundred and fifty dollars

137
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:57,140
I feel kinda like like I'm committing a

138
00:05:54,540 --> 00:06:00,180
crime and that's what

139
00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:02,400
$1,250 looks like there's this kind of

140
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:05,670
sadness that sets in as they realized

141
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:07,920
that the $2,000 Pizza isn't worth it at

142
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:09,630
all and they start to feel almost like

143
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:12,000
they've done something immoral it's a

144
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:14,040
feeling I've had many times myself after

145
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,440
spending too much money on some gilded

146
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:18,690
piece of trash in a vain attempt to fill

147
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:21,120
the hollow in my soul is their name for

148
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:23,760
that feeling well I like to call it

149
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:26,760
[ __ ] neoliberalism an opposed to

150
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:28,980
scarcity luxury communist utopia a bad

151
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:31,110
pizza covered in gold would just be a

152
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:32,550
bad pizza covered in gold you might be

153
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:34,920
mad at the chef for making a

154
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:36,750
disappointing pizza but you probably

155
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:39,060
wouldn't be overcome with feelings of

156
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:41,640
emptiness and guilt to fully understand

157
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:43,920
why a 2,000 dollar pizza is not worth it

158
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:47,280
you have to understand it in the context

159
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:49,710
of capitalism the price $2,000 tells you

160
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:51,120
the exchange value of the pizza and if

161
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:52,980
you live in America you have an

162
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,600
instinctive sense for what that means

163
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:56,850
because you know all the other things

164
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:59,100
you could buy with $2,000

165
00:06:56,850 --> 00:07:01,290
for a lot of people $2,000 would buy a

166
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:03,120
few months of food or health care or

167
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:04,470
golden nails and there's a lot of

168
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,690
families who sit around the kitchen

169
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:08,700
table every evening worrying about how

170
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:10,650
they're gonna afford golden nails and

171
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:13,170
it's that awareness that makes the

172
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:15,450
shitty $2,000 Pizza seem not just

173
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:18,180
aesthetically disappointing but almost

174
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:19,740
obscene or even immoral but of course to

175
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:22,200
call it immoral is actually to

176
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:24,150
misidentify the real problem so it's not

177
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:26,010
like those shitty YouTube comments that

178
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:28,530
go pizzas in Africa could have eaten

179
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:30,300
those children how dare you because the

180
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:32,220
problem isn't that Andrew Adam and

181
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:34,320
Steven are bad people for buying an

182
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:36,270
expensive flat bread smeared with gilded

183
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:38,310
cream cheese the problem is our economy

184
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:39,980
fundamentally operates in a way that

185
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:42,390
makes inevitable these repulsive

186
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:44,310
juxtapositions of scarcity and abundance

187
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:46,440
that's why I don't really agree with a

188
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:48,360
philosopher Peter Singer who has this

189
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:50,520
idea that many of the world's problems

190
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:52,230
could be solved if privileged American

191
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:54,300
college students would just become hedge

192
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:55,630
fund managers and donate most of their

193
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:57,610
income to buying mesquite

194
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:59,440
in the Congo I mean sure that would

195
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:01,510
probably help with certain situations

196
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,310
but it's not gonna change the fact that

197
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:05,730
the global economy is structured around

198
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:08,530
cheap exploited labor at the bottom and

199
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:10,810
$2,000 pizzas at the top another way to

200
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:13,330
approach this issue might be to ask who

201
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:15,490
are the goddamn reptiles well they're

202
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:17,740
certainly not the Jews I want to be

203
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:20,310
clear get everyone on the same page that

204
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:23,020
I'm not blaming the Jews for anything

205
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:25,510
except you know cooking the white race

206
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:27,040
but to be fair is someone had to cook

207
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:28,300
them the white race has really been

208
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:30,100
getting on my nerves lately so the

209
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:32,289
lizards are not the Jews they're not

210
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:34,570
reptilians from alpha Draconis they're

211
00:08:32,289 --> 00:08:36,729
not freemasons or globalists or the gay

212
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:38,919
agenda but the key insight is that

213
00:08:36,729 --> 00:08:42,640
they're not even really the capitalists

214
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:44,980
the lizards are capital itself and what

215
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:46,390
does that mean well I don't know but it

216
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:47,950
does make me sound like I've read a lot

217
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:49,180
of Marx doesn't have what I'm trying to

218
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:50,920
say is that the problems with our

219
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:52,720
economy are not just the product of

220
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:55,090
greed or some other personal moral

221
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,640
defect of the wealthy of course some

222
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:59,770
capitalists are terrible people but some

223
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:02,050
probably aren't and either way the

224
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:03,910
virtues or vices of the rich are sort of

225
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:05,980
beside the point so the real point of

226
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:07,960
the golden pizza is that it's emblematic

227
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:09,670
of the fact that the extreme economic

228
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:12,160
inequalities of our society are

229
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:13,600
laughably unjustifiable if I were to

230
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,550
translate the meaning of the golden

231
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,660
pizza into an argument so it goes

232
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:18,700
something like this

233
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:21,010
capitalism as we know it is a defective

234
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:22,420
economic system because although it's

235
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:24,340
good at creating large amounts of wealth

236
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:26,110
it distributes that wealth in an

237
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:27,940
incredibly inefficient way where

238
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:30,610
efficiency is understood not as the

239
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:32,710
capacity to maximize total wealth but as

240
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:34,540
the capacity to maximize human happiness

241
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:36,400
now I need to explain what I mean about

242
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:38,260
happiness here's a question should the

243
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:40,030
economy serve humanity or should

244
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:42,220
humanity serve the economy it seems

245
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:44,410
obvious to me that the economy should

246
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:46,660
serve humanity so what I look for in a

247
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:48,370
good economic system is that it produces

248
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:49,900
the most happiness for the people who

249
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:51,760
are a part of it so if you're willing to

250
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:53,680
go along with this the first question we

251
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,990
should ask is does having more wealth

252
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,670
make people happier and we actually have

253
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:59,460
data about that at least within the

254
00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:01,860
context of our own economics

255
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:03,930
and the data shows that more income does

256
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:05,640
lead to more happiness up to a certain

257
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:07,589
point but the happiness benefit of

258
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:10,290
increased income Plateau is somewhere

259
00:10:07,589 --> 00:10:12,360
between 65 and 95 thousand dollars a

260
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:13,980
year one interpretation of the reason

261
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:16,140
why happiness increases up to the

262
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:18,630
threshold is that at lower income levels

263
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:21,089
more income means less stress about

264
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:23,040
paying rent or mortgages or medical

265
00:10:21,089 --> 00:10:25,320
bills or college tuition but once you

266
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:27,510
pass the threshold more income basically

267
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:29,790
just translates into more disappointing

268
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:31,649
golden pizzas if that interpretation is

269
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:34,170
correct and the current income

270
00:10:31,649 --> 00:10:35,459
distribution seems really irrational at

271
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:37,770
least if the goal is to maximize

272
00:10:35,459 --> 00:10:39,870
happiness the income distribution in the

273
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:42,300
United States is skewed toward the upper

274
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:44,910
extreme so that the national mean income

275
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:47,279
is around 72 thousand dollars right in

276
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:49,500
the plateau zone but the national median

277
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:52,560
income is around 59 thousand dollars

278
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:54,930
significantly below it furthermore 1% of

279
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:56,459
the population or making more than three

280
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:59,070
hundred and eighty-nine thousand dollars

281
00:10:56,459 --> 00:11:01,320
a year several times the peak happiness

282
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:03,839
threshold so at least am i naive eyes

283
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:05,820
what it looks like is that millions of

284
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:08,190
people in this country don't have enough

285
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:10,860
money to securely afford food housing

286
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:12,930
education and health care well a few

287
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:15,120
million others are like constantly

288
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:16,860
gorging themselves on golden pizzas or

289
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,720
something but I'm guessing it's even

290
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:20,130
worse than that because it's not just

291
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,470
that some people don't have enough money

292
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:25,080
to meet all their needs it's that they

293
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:27,180
have to be poor while other people are

294
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:29,370
rich and since people compare themselves

295
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:31,680
to others that leads to all kinds of

296
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:34,140
additional anxieties and resentments and

297
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:36,180
social tensions is a study of capuchin

298
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:38,160
monkey that shows if you reward one

299
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:40,440
monkey for a task with a delicious grape

300
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,420
and a monkey in the adjacent cage with a

301
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:44,550
shitty hue convert the monkey who gets

302
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:46,589
the cucumber loses his shed and if you

303
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:48,690
do this to humans for long enough they

304
00:11:46,589 --> 00:11:50,850
start building guillotines well that's

305
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:53,070
just how it looks to me I could be wrong

306
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:56,040
I mean I'm not an economic theorist and

307
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:57,000
honestly I don't really understand how

308
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,890
the economy works

309
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,410
I don't even check my own bank account

310
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:04,350
balance very often I make the video as I

311
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:06,600
swipe the card so look if I'm wrong and

312
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:08,400
capitalism is good actually just to

313
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:10,020
leave a comment and I'll be happy to be

314
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:11,300
proven wrong but before you do that

315
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:12,570
let's get some of the more obvious

316
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:15,060
objections

317
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:17,580
the way income inequality exists because

318
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:19,290
not everyone does the same jobs some

319
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:21,150
people work harder than others and those

320
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:23,670
people deserve to make more money

321
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:25,680
well the sweatshop workers work really

322
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:27,330
hard and they barely make any money at

323
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,580
all and a lot of people who work minimum

324
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:31,260
wage have to work multiple jobs just to

325
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:33,210
sustain themselves and their families

326
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:35,220
it's actually a ton of work and they

327
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:36,900
barely make enough money to survive but

328
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:38,880
minimum wage workers are unskilled

329
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:40,980
workers why would anyone become an

330
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:42,780
innovator or medical researcher if they

331
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:45,540
could make a good living as a janitor

332
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:47,640
well janitorial work is pretty important

333
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:50,010
actually someone has to cook and clean

334
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:52,050
and I think people who do such necessary

335
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:53,100
work deserve a decent living but I also

336
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:55,620
think a lot of people would find

337
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:57,360
janitorial work boring and I think that

338
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:59,760
the kind of personality that likes to

339
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:02,370
innovate and invent often isn't driven

340
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:04,560
mainly by profit anyway Jonas Salk never

341
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:05,610
patented his polio vaccine even though

342
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,680
he could have made millions of dollars

343
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:09,930
from it because he just cared about

344
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:12,630
humanity and he was driven by a purpose

345
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:14,100
beyond personal profit in fact a lot of

346
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:16,080
great historical scientists were

347
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:18,180
upper-class people who didn't need to

348
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:19,650
work for a living at all and were just

349
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:22,110
driven by their own passion and

350
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:24,540
curiosity so let me get this straight

351
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:26,610
you criticize capitalism and yet you

352
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:29,310
yourself make money on the internet

353
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:31,650
hypocrite much a few years ago I was a

354
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:34,110
broke philosophy graduate student and

355
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:35,970
when I criticized capitalism then people

356
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:37,860
used to say why don't you stop whining

357
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:39,960
and get a real job and earn a living you

358
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:41,910
just present capitalism because you're

359
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:43,950
too lazy to put in the work it takes to

360
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:45,870
succeed so if people who are failing

361
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:47,550
under capitalism can't criticize it

362
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:48,870
because they're just resentful and

363
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:50,460
people who are succeeding under

364
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:53,040
capitalism can criticize it because

365
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:55,170
they're hypocrites then according to you

366
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:58,140
is anyone allowed to criticize

367
00:13:55,170 --> 00:14:00,300
capitalism capitalism may have problems

368
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:02,370
but it's the best economic system there

369
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:04,950
is you wouldn't want to live in Soviet

370
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:05,990
Russia or Maoist China would you well no

371
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:09,740
I wouldn't

372
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:13,730
hello I'm Tatiana thank you :

373
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:17,690
defense dalam [ __ ] off Bosley Daniel

374
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:19,940
fascist so granted a lot of past

375
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:21,470
communist regimes were shitty but that

376
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:23,270
doesn't mean that the current system is

377
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:25,460
the best and final system for all time

378
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:27,290
my approach to this topic is not to try

379
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:28,880
to resurrect soviet communism or

380
00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:30,260
anything like that but rather to

381
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:32,060
identify problems with the current

382
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:36,650
system that seemed to cause unhappiness

383
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:39,140
and instability okay but I like stuff I

384
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:40,940
like stuff too I think a lot of people

385
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:43,220
have this instinctive fear that a

386
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:45,260
capitalism goes so does everything we

387
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:48,290
love I mean when I think of communism in

388
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:51,170
particular I think of austerity scarcity

389
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:53,360
conformity undrinkable victory gin the

390
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:55,880
end of fashion all art required to be

391
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,590
propaganda just an all-around nightmare

392
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:59,720
situation for a person of my persuasion

393
00:14:57,590 --> 00:15:02,000
it's not for no reason at all that I

394
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:03,860
have these anxieties since there was an

395
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,690
aspect of that to some past communist

396
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:08,930
societies but this stuff I'm worried

397
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:11,150
about booze makeup art baths these

398
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:12,860
things existed long before capitalism

399
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:14,300
and they'll exist long after it and I

400
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:15,470
know different types of people will have

401
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:17,540
different things they're concerned about

402
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:19,910
straight guys will be like will there be

403
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:22,760
video games after capitalism Oh God and

404
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:24,230
yeah there will be Tetris is a Soviet

405
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:26,680
game and it's one of the best games of

406
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:26,680
the 80s

407
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:30,730
[Music]

408
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:32,740
some of the stuff we like could probably

409
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:34,660
even be improved if it were liberated

410
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:36,400
from capitalist pressures I mean look

411
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:38,380
with capitalism and the pressure to turn

412
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:40,120
a profit has done two movies the last

413
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:42,070
time I was reading the only book I've

414
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:44,470
ever read two ways of seeing by John

415
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:46,540
Berger I noticed this description of

416
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:48,700
glamour in the context of advertising

417
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:51,340
its promise is not a pleasure but of

418
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:54,010
happiness happiness as judged from the

419
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:57,070
outside by others the happiness of being

420
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:59,260
envied is glamour and I felt kind of

421
00:15:57,070 --> 00:16:01,600
attacked because glamour is very

422
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:04,210
important to us and by us I mean the

423
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:07,720
gays the owls the G's the bees the t's

424
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:09,610
and all those filthy filthy queues but

425
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:11,890
isn't it kind of true that at least in

426
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:13,600
advertising the function of glamour is

427
00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:15,610
to provoke feelings of envy and

428
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,230
inadequacy and the beholder in the

429
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:18,910
service of selling you [ __ ] but the

430
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:21,130
advertising function I think is an

431
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:23,230
appropriation of glamour not something

432
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:24,820
essential to it and maybe glamour would

433
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:26,680
actually be liberated if it weren't

434
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:28,720
constantly conflated with advertising

435
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:31,660
so I guess my message to socialists of

436
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:33,880
the world is that actually stuff is good

437
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:36,880
glamour is good videogames are good

438
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:38,830
luxury is good guys are good I mean even

439
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:40,660
gold is good if you don't abuse it

440
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:42,250
horribly you know the most offensive

441
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:44,980
thing about the golden pizza is

442
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:47,170
ultimately that the $2 pizza is actually

443
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:48,730
better the golden pizza is an affront

444
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:50,680
not just of the people whose medical

445
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:53,260
bills that could have paid but it's an

446
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:55,870
affront to gustatory pleasure itself so

447
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:58,270
I guess my final take here is actually

448
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:59,950
champagne socialism is good but I'm not

449
00:16:58,270 --> 00:17:01,420
talking about the champagne classes

450
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:02,320
becoming social I'm talking about

451
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:04,990
redistributing

452
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:06,250
the goddamn champagne all right now that

453
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:08,410
I've gotten these objections out of the

454
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:10,390
way I'm finally ready to get started

455
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:13,000
part one which you've all been waiting

456
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:13,420
for how to end capitalism once and for

457
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,640
all

458
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:17,530
well I don't know who do you people

459
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:19,569
think I am I'm a socially conscious

460
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:21,910
youtube entertainer not transsexual

461
00:17:19,569 --> 00:17:23,530
Gandhi I mean according to Marxism we

462
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:25,630
can't just start the revolution whenever

463
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:27,310
we feel like it capitalism has to fail

464
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:29,140
and that'll bring about the conditions

465
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:31,720
that make revolution inevitable so I

466
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:34,080
guess we just try to relax and wait for

467
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:37,280
that to happen

468
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:41,450
sure it's bound to happen any day now

00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:44,250

the meantime

472
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:50,429

477
00:17:57,179 --> 00:18:02,610
can we please not hand more power to the

478
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:09,030
absolute worst dingbats our society has
