there will be discussion of transphobic

6
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:32,009
slurs and violence and graphic displays

00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:35,100

hot tea and you can take it out in the

balcony and pour it on some pedestrians

that always cheers me up

15
00:00:51,829 --> 00:00:56,000
one Traps

16
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:59,579
[Music]

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,219
gentlemen of the Academy it is my duty

18
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:05,400
to submit to you the findings of my

19
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:07,680
latest mimetic research many sleepless

20
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:10,560
nights have I lingered in all the great

21
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,990
libraries of Europe scrutinizing volumes

22
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:16,950
ancient and modern in search of the

23
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:22,110
answer to two fundamental questions what

24
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:24,960
are traps and be they gay with respect

25
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:25,830
to the former inquiry I adduce for your

26
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,140
consideration

27
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:30,930
a treatise for the ladies scholar known

28
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:33,479
as the pedantic romantic we're in the

29
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:36,119
derivation of the word trap is traced to

30
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:39,720
patrons of animated pictures from the

31
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:41,280
Orient curious the chronicle begins in

32
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:44,009
the first years of the present century

33
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,649
when devotees of picture forums would

34
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:49,799
proclaim the idiom it's a trap alongside

35
00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:52,079
the likeness of one Admiral Ackbar to

36
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:54,899
suggest that some manner of deception

37
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:57,210
had taken place contemporaneous to this

38
00:01:54,899 --> 00:02:00,180
was a most whimsical mania for

39
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:02,340
depictions of nymph a chaplain asks to

40
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:05,750
some of which the aforementioned slogan

41
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:08,479
would be rejoined the implication

42
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:10,670
the subject of the portrait was not insu

43
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:13,670
the daughter of Eve but rather that the

44
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:17,360
spectator had fallen prey to some manner

45
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:19,730
of transvestite skulduggery furthermore

46
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,550
it appears that from the first the

47
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:23,690
designation trap has signified not only

48
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:26,540
transvestites

49
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:29,090
but transsexuals as well and this must

50
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:31,820
needs be remarked for his evidence such

51
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:34,489
persons of times and flame the last of

52
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:36,770
ordinary men it is hence with respect to

53
00:02:34,489 --> 00:02:41,570
this phenomenon I pose my second

54
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:43,780
question thus fellows is it gay I'm

55
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:47,900
sorry who are you talking to

56
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:49,940

thrown out of Dairy Queen again it must

58
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:56,930
needs be remarked please stop breaking

59
00:02:53,870 --> 00:03:03,709
into my house I shall be a queen of

60
00:02:56,930 --> 00:03:08,739
Dairy I'm sure you will be crossdresser

61
00:03:03,709 --> 00:03:12,260
hi I'm Nathalie when biological woman

62
00:03:08,739 --> 00:03:18,320
can we pan the camera down my hair is

63
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:20,630
less hi our traps gay the meme that will

64
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:23,030
not die originating around 15 years ago

65
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:24,829
on 4chan the word trap refers to either

66
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:27,799
a male crossdresser or a trans woman

67
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:30,440
especially in a context of jnanis kawaii

68
00:03:27,799 --> 00:03:32,600
decadence the meme our traps gay is a

69
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:34,940
mostly jokey debate about the sexuality

70
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:37,400
of men attracted to dick girls futanari

71
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:39,200
MTF you know a lot of these men don't

72
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:41,600
know or care but the difference between

73
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,280
a trans woman and a crossdresser so it's

74
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:45,260
kind of pointless to get hung up on that

75
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,940
the man peaked in popularity about a

76
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:48,680
year ago when someone released the worst

77
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:52,070
specimens of the white race into the

78
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:55,670
wild all traps gay one of life's most

79
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:59,360
important questions are traps traps are

80
00:03:55,670 --> 00:04:02,030
gay you know yes

81
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:06,350
will there will there be transsexuals in

82
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:07,970
the Ethne state hopefully not to the men

83
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:09,920
who meme about this topic it's all

84
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:11,800
light-hearted fun it's part of a wider

85
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,840
game they like to play called is it

86
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:16,300
you know is it gay to have an MMF

87
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:19,030
threesome only if the balls touch don't

88
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:21,160
cross the streams and so on but too many

89
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:23,650
trans women the meme and the word trap

90
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:25,180
itself are highly offensive in fact last

91
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:27,130
year when I first proposed making a

92
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:28,990
video about this topic many trans people

93
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:30,820
on Twitter were outraged because they

94
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:32,890
felt that this topic is just too harmful

95
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:35,170
to even discuss so here's the challenge

96
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:36,580
I face making this video on the one hand

97
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:37,840
there's people who are going to be upset

98
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:39,910
and offended that I'm making a video

99
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,620
about this topic at all and on the other

100
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:43,420
hand there are people who think this is

101
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:44,890
all just harmless otaku should posting

102
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:46,900
and who are going to be annoyed by my

103
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:48,580
trigger warnings but first to the people

104
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:50,170
who think it's too offensive here's what

105
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:51,700
I have to say for myself I've always

106
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:53,380
believed that if you want to persuade

107
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:55,660
anyone it helps to meet them where

108
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:57,910
they're on and in this case our traps

109
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:59,470
gay is where people are on that one of

110
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:01,060
my youtube meetups I met a high school

111
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:02,980
teacher who told me that he overheard

112
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:04,990
some of his male students joking in the

113
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:06,640
hallway about our craps game when those

114
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:08,800
teenage boys go home and Google our

115
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,370
craps gay who do you want to explain it

116
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,770
to them

117
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:14,290
your choices are Miley innopolis this

118
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:16,900
guy a Scottish hate crime convict named

119
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:19,060
count dank EULA or this Tran and at the

120
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:21,310
risk of sounding arrogant I think it

121
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:23,230
should be me you know as trans women we

122
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:24,580
have little influence in society the

123
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:26,500
people who lead the conversations about

124
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:28,480
us are bigger and stronger than we are

125
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:31,360
so we're like a jogger racing against a

126
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:34,360
car the only way to win is to hijack the

127
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:36,670
car and so this video is my attempt to

128
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:39,400
hijack the conversation that straight

129
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:41,200
men are having about us as always my

130
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:43,360
aspiration is to derive a will

131
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:45,160
conclusion from edgy premises to

132
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:48,280
shitpost my way to the moral high ground

133
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:49,660
now straight men isn't all this offense

134
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:51,160
taking just more politically correct

135
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:53,920
cuckold redesigned to take away your

136
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:55,780
free speech well I assure you there will

137
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:57,669
be no taking of your free speech on this

138
00:05:55,780 --> 00:06:00,880
channel unless you clock my makeup

139
00:05:57,669 --> 00:06:02,560
dickbag comment deleted but if you want

140
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,740
to know why trans women are offended by

141
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,990
our crops gay

142
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:07,810
I'm happy to tell you not to silence you

143
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:10,610
of course but just in case you have the

144
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:13,130
intellectual curiosity to want to know

145
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:15,170
why someone different from you might be

146
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:20,260
hurt by something that seems harmless to

147
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:24,710
you so well let's put it this way to

148
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:26,780
transpannic the 1990 documentary Paris

149
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:28,190
is burning depicts the ball culture of

150
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:30,050
black and Latino acts gay and

151
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:31,940
transgender people in New York City in

152
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:33,950
the late 1980s one of the main

153
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:36,290
storylines follows a trans woman named

154
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:38,540
Venus Xtravaganza who describes her

155
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:41,540
precarious existence as a sex worker I

156
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:43,820
was with a guy and he was playing with

157
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:46,160
Mike cities until he touched me down

158
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:48,530
there he felt it he seen and he like

159
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:51,380
totally flipped out he said you [ __ ]

160
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:53,060
[ __ ] you're a freak you're a victim of

161
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:54,770
AIDS and you're trying to give me AIDS

162
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:57,910
what are you crazy you're a homo I

163
00:06:54,770 --> 00:07:00,440
should kill him and like I was really

164
00:06:57,910 --> 00:07:02,780
terrified so I just jumped out the

165
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:04,730
window during the filming of Paris is

166
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:06,860
burning Venus was choked to death

167
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:08,780
presumably by a client her body was

168
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:10,940
discovered four days later under a hotel

169
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:12,800
pad trans women in my country almost

170
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:14,780
entirely trans women of color are

171
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,690
murdered at a disgracefully high rate

172
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:19,730
reaching a record of 29 deaths and 2017

173
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:21,500
the men who murdered trans women often

174
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:23,240
claimed they were provoked to violence

175
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:25,190
by the alleged deception of their

176
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:28,280
victims this is what's called the trans

177
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:30,650
panic defense when legally invoked as in

178
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:33,200
the 2004 trial of the killers of the

179
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:35,000
teenage trans girl Gwen Araujo one of

180
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:37,280
the killers who had sex with Gwen before

181
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,770
learning she was trans cried I can't be

182
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:41,690
[ __ ] gay before beating her to death

183
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:43,820
men are often willing to side with these

184
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:45,470
killers saying that if trans women don't

185
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:47,450
want to get murdered then they shouldn't

186
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:50,210
trick men but what you have to

187
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:51,500
understand is first men usually do know

188
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:53,360
when they're having sex with a trans

189
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:55,460
woman like if you have a dick it's

190
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,170
pretty hard actually do you have sex

191
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:59,660
with someone and have them not notice it

192
00:07:57,170 --> 00:08:02,090
and second a lot of men view trans

193
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:04,100
women's entire existence as itself a

194
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:05,910
kind of trickery a black trans woman

195
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:08,250
named Ilan nettles was murdered

196
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:10,410
Haarlem in 2013 by a man whose friends

197
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:13,050
had mocked him for flirting with her all

198
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:15,060
she did to provoke him was walk down the

199
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:17,340
street with two friends the common

200
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:19,440
thread here is not deception on the part

201
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:21,480
of the victims but rather the drive of

202
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,760
the killer's to protect their social

203
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:25,650
standing as masculine and straight but

204
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:28,230
being perceived as a kind of fraudulent

205
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:30,300
lure is something that many trans women

206
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:33,180
across class and raised experienced some

207
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:36,270
version of because men view femininity

208
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:39,210
itself as a kind of enticement as the

209
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:41,550
orchid Asia's invitation to a proboscis

210
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:43,500
I was just reading a Twitter thread by a

211
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:45,510
trans woman who was attacked recently by

212
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:47,610
a man at her bar who started flirting

213
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:49,380
with her until he realizes she was trans

214
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:50,550
and then punched her like what was she

215
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:52,800
supposed to do to stop that from

216
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:54,720
happening just stay at home for trans

217
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,880
women fears about men retaliating

218
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,800
against us for existing actually limit

219
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:01,050
our freedom there's bars I won't go into

220
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:03,480
because I don't trust the clientele to

221
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:05,880
side with me if some [ __ ] like that goes

222
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:07,530
down and I've had little scares I was in

223
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:09,840
the back of an uber once the driver

224
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:11,760
comes on a little flirty you know what's

225
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:13,830
your name are you a student and I'm

226
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:16,110
thinking wow he thinks I'm young enough

227
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:18,420
to be a student but at some point he

228
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:20,550
goes silent and suddenly I'm getting a

229
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:23,340
very icy glare in the rear view mirror

230
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:25,590
like [ __ ] clocked and for a second

231
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:27,750
I'm like [ __ ] I'm gonna die in the back

232
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:30,090
of this car and of course I didn't die

233
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:30,960
the rest of the ride was quiet but it

234
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:33,330
was fine

235
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:35,040
I mean I'm gonna be fine because white

236
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:36,600
middle-class transsexuals don't get

237
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,790
murdered in this country the murder

238
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:40,800
issue exists at a specific intersection

239
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:42,690
of gender class and race and it's really

240
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,610
not my oppression to claim you know I

241
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:46,590
sometimes hear white bougie middle class

242
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:48,540
computer program or trans women be like

243
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:51,150
we're getting murdered in the streets

244
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:53,430
who's we it's not white middle-class

245
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:55,920
trans women so the transpannic murder

246
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:57,690
issue is really not my lane it exists at

247
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,940
this intersection of masculinity and

248
00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:01,320
race and it's really not a conversation

249
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:04,410
that should be led by a white woman

250
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:06,060
especially when there's so so so many

251
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:08,750
things to critique about white

252
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:11,370
masculinity let's talk about some now

253
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:15,210
three taking offense

254
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:17,100
okay back to traps now this is my lane

255
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:19,710
I'm not sure anything has ever been more

256
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:22,800
my lane ah the exquisite pleasure of

257
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:24,960
being entitled to the soapbox so boys

258
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:27,120
I've showed you how trans women's

259
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:29,100
freedom is abridged by our need to

260
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,450
navigate around men who you are gender

261
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:33,810
presentation and start our very

262
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:35,610
existence as a kind of trap I think it

263
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:37,770
should therefore be pretty clear why

264
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:39,270
trans women are not the biggest fans of

265
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:41,760
you using that word for us or for

266
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:43,589
futanari or cross dressers or whatever I

267
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:46,260
mean to be honest if someone calls me a

268
00:10:43,589 --> 00:10:48,360
trap my response is more like Wow a

269
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:50,280
transfer thought I look like a woman

270
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:51,540
but that's because I'm so pathetic I

271
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:53,160
have to go dumpster diving for

272
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:55,110
validation but the rest of the trans

273
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:56,940
women out there the ones with dignity

274
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:59,220
and self-respect you should definitely

275
00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:00,660
not call them drops of course some trans

276
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:02,370
women will overstate the case and say

277
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:04,589
the word trap is literally getting trans

278
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:06,330
women killed which I can't find any

279
00:11:04,589 --> 00:11:08,550
examples of the word trap being

280
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:10,740
connected to a murder but why don't we

281
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:12,600
stop using the word before someone dies

282
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:14,640
hmm because what you're doing when you

283
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:16,620
call trans women traps is you're showing

284
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,570
that you think of us the exact same way

285
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:20,460
as the men who try to justify attacking

286
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:22,830
us when a man kills a trans woman

287
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:24,900
literally the argument he trots out in

288
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:26,700
court is that he was trapped and that's

289
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:27,570
what you're reminding us of when you use

290
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:29,339
that a word

291
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:31,020
and that's why trans women are getting

292
00:11:29,339 --> 00:11:32,970
triggered over you know sometimes people

293
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:35,850
have good reasons for being triggered by

294
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:38,010
things and this is one of those times so

295
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:40,050
if I were a different kind of creator I

296
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:41,670
could really end this video now I think

297
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:44,040
I've made a pretty convincing case that

298
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:46,589
trans women are justifiably offended by

299
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:48,360
the word trap but if I leave it at that

300
00:11:46,589 --> 00:11:51,270
and this is for you Twitter this is why

301
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:53,670
I made this video if I simply argue that

302
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:55,740
our traps que is offensive then here's

303
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:57,780
what happens first a lot of people

304
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:59,059
simply don't give a [ __ ] in fact me

305
00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:00,679
telling them it's offensive only

306
00:11:59,059 --> 00:12:02,359
makes them want to say it more because

307
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:04,969
they feel in a deep level that they are

308
00:12:02,359 --> 00:12:06,799
by nature superior to trans people so an

309
00:12:04,969 --> 00:12:08,329
uppity to need telling them what words

310
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:10,459
they're allowed to say completely

311
00:12:08,329 --> 00:12:12,529
embraces them so they'll comment traps

312
00:12:10,459 --> 00:12:14,389
are gay well just to reaffirm their

313
00:12:12,529 --> 00:12:16,489
superiority over me and that I have no

314
00:12:14,389 --> 00:12:17,929
power or influence over them and there's

315
00:12:16,489 --> 00:12:21,079
really nothing I can do about those

316
00:12:17,929 --> 00:12:23,089
people but another group of people the

317
00:12:21,079 --> 00:12:25,879
socially progressive liberals they'll

318
00:12:23,089 --> 00:12:27,499
say ok so since you're offended by it I

319
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:29,089
won't say the word trapped anymore and

320
00:12:27,499 --> 00:12:30,859
they'll be super woke about it and

321
00:12:29,089 --> 00:12:32,479
they'll post Twitter call-outs canceling

322
00:12:30,859 --> 00:12:33,889
anyone who uses the word trap and

323
00:12:32,479 --> 00:12:35,809
they'll be very respectful and

324
00:12:33,889 --> 00:12:38,329
compassionate toward trans people in

325
00:12:35,809 --> 00:12:40,969
public so long as it makes them look

326
00:12:38,329 --> 00:12:42,919
good to indulge and pity this tragic

327
00:12:40,969 --> 00:12:45,529
third-world country of a gender minority

328
00:12:42,919 --> 00:12:47,479
but then you'll go home at night and in

329
00:12:45,529 --> 00:12:50,359
that twilight between consciousness and

330
00:12:47,479 --> 00:12:53,689
sleep their inner voice will whisper but

331
00:12:50,359 --> 00:12:55,459
our traps and then years later when

332
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:57,499
their son brings home a transgender

333
00:12:55,459 --> 00:12:59,569
girlfriend will suddenly watch all that

334
00:12:57,499 --> 00:13:01,429
shallow openness vanish like so much

335
00:12:59,569 --> 00:13:03,859
politically correct a vapor real

336
00:13:01,429 --> 00:13:06,229
acceptance has to be built and real

337
00:13:03,859 --> 00:13:08,839
understanding so it's not enough for me

338
00:13:06,229 --> 00:13:13,909
to argue that our traps gay is offensive

339
00:13:08,839 --> 00:13:18,169
I also have to argue whether drops are

340
00:13:13,909 --> 00:13:21,489
gay so our traps gay let's watch an

341
00:13:18,169 --> 00:13:21,489
instructional video to learn more

342
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:33,119
[Music]

343
00:13:35,529 --> 00:13:45,370
or a philosopher hello boys it is I the

344
00:13:41,769 --> 00:13:47,439
half Queen points after 30 days and 30

345
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:49,149
nights the philosopher descended from

346
00:13:47,439 --> 00:13:52,899
the mountaintop and to the gathered

347
00:13:49,149 --> 00:13:55,769
villagers thus spake our traps gay and

348
00:13:52,899 --> 00:14:01,319
he to whom the half Queen thus replied

349
00:13:55,769 --> 00:14:01,319
hmm let's see let me think about it oh

350
00:14:01,589 --> 00:14:05,949
I'm gonna stop saying trap now because

351
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:07,480
it's not a good word as has been

352
00:14:05,949 --> 00:14:08,860
explained in fact it's really best to

353
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:11,079
treat it like a slur so what we're

354
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:13,029
really asking here is if a man is

355
00:14:11,079 --> 00:14:15,699
attracted to or has sex with a trans

356
00:14:13,029 --> 00:14:18,249
woman is that gay well the simple answer

357
00:14:15,699 --> 00:14:22,449
is no because trans women are women and

358
00:14:18,249 --> 00:14:24,459
a man having sex with a woman is let's

359
00:14:22,449 --> 00:14:27,189
see here according to the experts I've

360
00:14:24,459 --> 00:14:28,720
consulted it is not in fact gay but

361
00:14:27,189 --> 00:14:30,279
that's not the most persuasive answer

362
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,379
because in order to find it convincing

363
00:14:30,279 --> 00:14:34,689
you already have to believe that trans

364
00:14:32,379 --> 00:14:36,639
women are women and unfortunately if you

365
00:14:34,689 --> 00:14:39,069
ask the average person about this what

366
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:42,430
they say is something like sure I think

367
00:14:39,069 --> 00:14:44,889
trans women are women but they shouldn't

368
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:47,199
expect men to want to date them unless

369
00:14:44,889 --> 00:14:50,949
they're into that sort of thing

370
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:53,350
oh and what sort of thing is that

371
00:14:50,949 --> 00:14:54,850
usually when a man tells you he's dating

372
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:57,399
a woman and you say oh what's she like

373
00:14:54,850 --> 00:15:00,939
and he says she's from Cincinnati your

374
00:14:57,399 --> 00:15:03,910
response is not oh David I didn't

375
00:15:00,939 --> 00:15:05,769
realize you were into that sort of thing

376
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:09,220
in other words these people tell you

377
00:15:05,769 --> 00:15:10,389
trans women are women but and then they

378
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:12,639
say something that shows they don't

379
00:15:10,389 --> 00:15:13,059
really think trans women are women at

380
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:15,370
all

381
00:15:13,059 --> 00:15:17,800
so since test audiences have proven

382
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:19,929
shaky on that point it would basically

383
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:21,670
be circular reasoning for me to try to

384
00:15:19,929 --> 00:15:24,129
argue that attraction to trans women

385
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:26,290
isn't gay because trans women are women

386
00:15:24,129 --> 00:15:28,000
since the womanhood of trans women is

387
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:28,600
precisely the point that's being

388
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,519
disputed

389
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:33,399
so maybe the observational approach is

390
00:15:30,519 --> 00:15:35,290
better the facts are indisputable many

391
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:37,600
heterosexual men are attracted to trans

392
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:39,160
women and comparatively few gay men are

393
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,930
now to trans women

394
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:43,029
is just an obvious fact about our

395
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:45,759
everyday experience in the world we now

396
00:15:43,029 --> 00:15:48,040
who's attracted to us and who isn't so

397
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:50,290
to us this completely unnecessary debate

398
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:52,870
it's as impractical as the question of

399
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:54,819
whether the Sun will rise tomorrow sure

400
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:57,519
philosophers can say but how do we know

401
00:15:54,819 --> 00:15:59,470
the Sun will rise tomorrow to which the

402
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:01,569
correct response is shut the [ __ ] up

403
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:03,310
nerd stop playing 3d chess against your

404
00:16:01,569 --> 00:16:04,930
own brain and find a real thing to worry

405
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:06,459
about it's just a basic fact of

406
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:08,709
experience that the Sun rises every

407
00:16:06,459 --> 00:16:10,569
morning and to transwomen it's a basic

408
00:16:08,709 --> 00:16:12,399
fact of experience of the people who are

409
00:16:10,569 --> 00:16:14,680
attracted to us are people who are

410
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:16,089
attracted to women of this is man I've

411
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:18,850
been with since I started my transition

412
00:16:16,089 --> 00:16:20,829
all identify is straight and all had

413
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:23,589
only ever been with six women until this

414
00:16:20,829 --> 00:16:26,019
trio malong am I really so powerful as a

415
00:16:23,589 --> 00:16:28,509
doctress that lifetime heterosexuals are

416
00:16:26,019 --> 00:16:32,290
turning gay over these tiny tips let's

417
00:16:28,509 --> 00:16:34,600
not get cocky I mean if a man is

418
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:36,430
attracted to women and not to men and he

419
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:38,560
perceives me as a woman and is attracted

420
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:40,600
to me as a woman and he sleeps with me

421
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:43,029
and then he continues being attracted to

422
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:44,829
women and not to men in what world is

423
00:16:43,029 --> 00:16:46,689
that anything but a straight man what

424
00:16:44,829 --> 00:16:48,579
wild maze of reasoning do you have to

425
00:16:46,689 --> 00:16:50,560
invent argue that this man is really gay

426
00:16:48,579 --> 00:16:52,240
well we all know exactly how this maze

427
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:56,649
of reasoning goes beginning with the

428
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:58,870
obvious what about the penis oh yes the

429
00:16:56,649 --> 00:17:00,790
penis look baby we'll get to the penis

430
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:02,410
don't you worry about that but first I

431
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:04,839
should remind everyone that a lot of

432
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:08,069
trans women do in fact have vaginas

433
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:08,069
because they got filed

434
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:13,929
in fact I've been thinking of signing up

435
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:16,000
for a vagina myself but the thing is I

436
00:17:13,929 --> 00:17:18,339
make too much money for Medicaid now so

437
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,049
I have to form an LLC become my own

438
00:17:18,339 --> 00:17:22,270
employer so I can give myself health

439
00:17:20,049 --> 00:17:24,010
benefits and AH has so much paperwork

440
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:25,419
you were to be going to unincorporated

441
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:26,890
legal entity in this country just

442
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:28,630
thinking a [ __ ] cut of course

443
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:30,610
transphobic radical feminists will say

444
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:32,530
it's not a real vagina just a [ __ ] hole

445
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:35,350
because the real vagina is a sacred

446
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:37,179
passage and that's fine by me what am I

447
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:39,760
gonna do with a sacred passage anyway

448
00:17:37,179 --> 00:17:41,200
get fingered by the Pope pass straight

449
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:43,270
men don't get hung up on this I

450
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,400
guarantee you no straight man has ever

451
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:46,990
thought of a vagina as a sacred passage

452
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:48,490
they're either grossed out by it or

453
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:50,260
they're trying to climb inside what I'm

454
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:51,970
trying to say is in the past I've been a

455
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:54,340
little uncertain about getting a vagina

456
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:56,770
because my genital dysphoria is that bad

457
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:59,169
and besides chicks with dicks are very

458
00:17:56,770 --> 00:18:01,090
in right now right 2019 very trending

459
00:17:59,169 --> 00:18:02,650
and being a [ __ ] it's kind of like

460
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:04,419
being a legendary Pokemon you know

461
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:06,250
people take interests people pay

462
00:18:04,419 --> 00:18:06,880
attention to you and isn't that what we

463
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:08,409
all want

464
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:11,169
but unfashionable though it is I do

465
00:18:08,409 --> 00:18:13,299
think I want the surgery because well

466
00:18:11,169 --> 00:18:15,970
guys kind of confess something kind of

467
00:18:13,299 --> 00:18:18,640
dark to you I have this really [ __ ] up

468
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:20,799
fetish where I want a boy to put his

469
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:23,559
penis in my vagina

470
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:24,880
crazy right I mean I like anal but the

471
00:18:23,559 --> 00:18:27,159
gross thing about anal is you have to

472
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,720
eat will you I don't want to eat well I

473
00:18:27,159 --> 00:18:30,909
want to shove garbage into my mouth hole

474
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,380
and get dick does that a crime it has

475
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:34,240
kind of a scary surgery though like one

476
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:35,230
of my vagina sucks I'm afraid I have

477
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,880
some bad news

478
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:39,460
the tests are bought and were showing

479
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:42,280
them in the medical terminology your

480
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:44,049
vagina does indeed suck the point is the

481
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:45,429
easy sell version of the argument I'm

482
00:18:44,049 --> 00:18:47,289
making is that there's nothing

483
00:18:45,429 --> 00:18:49,030
homosexual of at a man's attraction to a

484
00:18:47,289 --> 00:18:51,309
trans woman who's been on hormones a

485
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:53,350
couple years she has female skin she

486
00:18:51,309 --> 00:18:55,330
smells like a woman she has breasts

487
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:57,520
she's giving hair body face she's

488
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:59,470
post-op and has a vagina no even in this

489
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:01,299
situation people will still say it's gay

490
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:03,820
because of the chromosomes but look

491
00:19:01,299 --> 00:19:06,130
human beings have five senses and none

492
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:07,539
of them can detect chromosomes sexual

493
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:09,490
attraction is not based on some

494
00:19:07,539 --> 00:19:12,010
chromosomal metaphysics of gender it's

495
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:13,690
based on perception and of your man and

496
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:15,580
you perceive someone as a woman and

497
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:17,679
you're attracted to her as a woman then

498
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:18,070
you are having a heterosexual moment my

499
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:20,440
dude

500
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:22,900
congratulations UUM breeder the argument

501
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:25,000
people make is okay fine it's straight

502
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:26,890
if you mistake her for a biological

503
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:30,640
woman but if you know she's a man and

504
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:32,410
you're still attracted then it's yeah so

505
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,570
look if you believe that trans women are

506
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:36,610
men the not belief might interfere with

507
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:38,200
your perceptions and it might change the

508
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:40,540
relationship between your perceptions

509
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:42,610
and your sexual response but more likely

510
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:44,620
is that you still will feel attraction

511
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:46,210
to the trans woman only if you value

512
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:48,040
your identity as a straight man

513
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:50,050
you'll feel ashamed of your attraction

514
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:51,670
you know try to fight and deny it and

515
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:53,710
you'll probably end up treating trans

516
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:56,260
women like absolute garbage now if I

517
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:58,540
wanted to make the SJW 101 type response

518
00:19:56,260 --> 00:20:01,270
here I would say trans women are women

519
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:03,190
because they identify as women and so

520
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:04,780
every heterosexual man who's

521
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:07,540
experiencing attraction to a trans woman

522
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:09,880
is necessarily experiencing heterosexual

523
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:12,610
attraction because of the way the person

524
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:13,840
he's attracted to identifies but that's

525
00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:15,940
just replacing the black and white

526
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:17,410
thinking of a biology dogma with the

527
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:20,140
black and white thinking of an identity

528
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:22,060
dogma but human sexuality is not black

529
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:24,250
and white it's not even shades of grey

530
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:26,440
it's a multicolored acid trip it's

531
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:28,150
centaur Donna Summer charging at you

532
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:29,980
with a spanking paddle so sexual

533
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:31,750
attraction is not based on chromosomes

534
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:34,120
but it's not usually based on

535
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:36,190
psychological identity either most of

536
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:38,080
the time initial attraction anyway is

537
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:40,090
based on what I'd call presentation

538
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:41,860
how're you looking at and I think that's

539
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:44,080
especially true of men they get turned

540
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:46,690
on by that initial visual pop they see

541
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:48,580
they concur they come I mean you have to

542
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:52,150
admire the simplicity of it sometimes I

543
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:54,430
wish I said look if what you want is a

544
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:56,380
woman who pumps then rest assured there

545
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:58,120
are plenty of trans women who pop maybe

546
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:59,890
you don't think I pop but you'd be

547
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:02,050
hard-pressed to argue that any number of

548
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:04,540
trans models and actresses don't pop as

549
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:06,610
much as any sis woman pops so the pop is

550
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:08,500
undeniable no one's questioning the pop

551
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:10,090
in fact without the pop it never would

552
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:11,980
have occurred to man to call trans women

553
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:13,960
traps because they wouldn't be trapped

554
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:15,850
if they weren't attracted in the first

555
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:18,190
place but a lot of men seem to think

556
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:20,020
that the pop the visual presentation of

557
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:22,270
a trans woman is some kind of illusion

558
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:24,490
or facade that at some point will be

559
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:27,070
dropped revealing that our womanhood

560
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:28,450
sham and that were really man now here's

561
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:30,460
a big difference between dating a trans

562
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:33,280
woman and dating a drag queen if you did

563
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:34,960
assist dry queen at some point you're

564
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:37,210
getting a man honey as explained by the

565
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,770
only good youtuber Jasmine masters I

566
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:40,540
don't want to date nobody who wouldn't

567
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:42,780
date me like this because this comes off

568
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:46,120
and you're not doing nothing with this

569
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:47,770
but if you date me there's no D dragging

570
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:50,800
there's no moment where I become a man

571
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:51,910
baby what you see is what you got at

572
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:55,450
least on this side this is my natural

573
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:57,340
side and this is my biological side

574
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:58,390
we're discussing people are trans we

575
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:59,800
immediately scan the first paragraph

576
00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:03,840
trans woman in never purse them and

577
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:05,429
their biological pronouns biology

578
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:07,919
everyone's always hating on trans women

579
00:22:05,429 --> 00:22:09,389
for being stereotypically feminine so

580
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:11,190
why do you think that in the bedroom

581
00:22:09,389 --> 00:22:13,200
we'd be any other way part of it is that

582
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:14,909
people are really ignorant about hormone

583
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:17,100
replacement therapy and what it does for

584
00:22:14,909 --> 00:22:19,470
trans women it feminized as our skin or

585
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:21,779
smell our body fat distribution and

586
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:24,750
makes us grow breasts that's right these

587
00:22:21,779 --> 00:22:26,399
are my very real very biological titties

588
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:27,450
I mean I'm wearing a push-up bra but at

589
00:22:26,399 --> 00:22:31,710
least there's something to push-up now

590
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:33,750
here I'll show you I mean they're small

591
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:36,240
but it's not by any measure a male chest

592
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:39,120
and what I have is very real very

593
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:40,350
biological and very female you people

594
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:43,590
think everything to do with trans women

595
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:45,090
is fake fake boys fake boobs fake hair

596
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:46,799
but that's prejudice more than

597
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:48,720
observation like I've noticed that

598
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:51,659
whether or not I actually wear a wig in

599
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:53,340
a video has exactly zero effect on how

600
00:22:51,659 --> 00:22:55,500
many people comment to call me a man in

601
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:57,029
a wig so I may as well just wear wigs my

602
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:58,380
mates look at my boobs done too since

603
00:22:57,029 --> 00:23:00,360
people are gonna call them fake either

604
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:02,250
way but for what it's worth this is my

605
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:03,630
real hair at least on this half and

606
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:06,600
these are my real boobs

607
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:08,429
and if I bring home a gentleman all that

608
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:10,380
stays on in bed and it's there when I

609
00:23:08,429 --> 00:23:13,350
wake up in the morning but what about

610
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:15,960
the penis alright alright look if the

611
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:16,380
penis is feminine how is that gay I rest

612
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,450
my case

613
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:17,460
roll credits

614
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:21,869
[Applause]

615
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:21,869
[Music]

616
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:29,580
six the feminine penis look some guys

617
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:30,930
want the t's and the D and that's now a

618
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:32,910
lot of people assume that the

619
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:34,860
involvement of a dick even a lady dick

620
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:37,740
makes any sexual interaction with a man

621
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:41,220
gay but isn't male homosexuality usually

622
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:43,860
understood as attraction to men and not

623
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:46,200
merely two penises wherever they may

624
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:49,050
arise I think there probably are some

625
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:50,760
gay men who really just like dick and

626
00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:52,680
I'm not judging I'm not here to attack

627
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:54,660
anyone's preferences but being a

628
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:57,150
straight man I don't really think that's

629
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:59,520
best understood as a man attracted to

630
00:23:57,150 --> 00:24:01,590
vaginas you call women [ __ ] but then

631
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:03,390
you're always like yo periods I'm a

632
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:05,190
straight man I'm not used to putting a

633
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:06,870
towel down when I [ __ ] I don't know how

634
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:08,400
to use a condom because I expect this

635
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:09,870
room and it be on birth control and do

636
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:12,150
everything for me and then you have

637
00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:13,980
straight in cells online calling Leah be

638
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:16,050
a roast-beef and generally putting on a

639
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:17,970
show of vaginal disgust I mean if you're

640
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:19,950
gonna date sis women are post-op trans

641
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:21,840
women I think you owe it to them to be a

642
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:23,220
little more of a Jain appositive because

643
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:25,980
even those straight men are like you

644
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:27,960
dicks that's gay you guys also kind of

645
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:29,970
love dicks you're always drawing them

646
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:31,830
your buildings look like dicks you're

647
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:33,690
poor and all has dicks in it so what

648
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:35,970
about dicks on chicks well men like

649
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:36,960
chicks and men like dicks so what's the

650
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:38,940
problem officer

651
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:41,010
I think the booming popularity of tea

652
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:43,740
girl porn speaks for itself on pornhub

653
00:24:41,010 --> 00:24:45,390
the [ __ ] category contains more

654
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:48,480
videos than other such popular

655
00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:50,400
categories as rough sex orgy and webcam

656
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:52,500
and it's mostly straight men who watch

657
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:54,090
it when a dull Empire dot-com moved

658
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:55,710
their tea girl content from their gay

659
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:58,710
site to their straight site views

660
00:24:55,710 --> 00:25:00,660
increased 50% in 2016 the same year

661
00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:02,880
North Carolina passed a transphobic and

662
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:04,980
discriminatory bathroom bill the adult

663
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:07,290
site game links top-selling titles in

664
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:10,140
North Carolina where my transsexual

665
00:25:07,290 --> 00:25:13,110
teacher [ __ ] shenanigans and Joey

666
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:15,180
sill Vera's trans visions six a lot of

667
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:17,220
straight men first find out about trans

668
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:19,620
women through porn which isn't great

669
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:21,990
since most t girl porn is not trans

670
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:24,240
positive and uses dehumanizing slurs

671
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:25,650
like [ __ ] and [ __ ] which is how you

672
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:27,600
end up living in a country full of

673
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:29,850
people who will jerk off to you but

674
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:32,250
won't give you rights so to a lot of men

675
00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:34,650
that's the representation we have she

676
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:35,850
emails [ __ ] and Caitlyn Jenner great

677
00:25:34,650 --> 00:25:38,010
I love that for

678
00:25:35,850 --> 00:25:40,020
now there probably are some men who will

679
00:25:38,010 --> 00:25:42,750
always be put off by a woman's having a

680
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:45,690
dick and you know what that's fine not

681
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:48,270
every man can be a poet a visionary a

682
00:25:45,690 --> 00:25:50,340
sage you like what you like I'm not here

683
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:52,470
to police anyone's desires in fact quite

684
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:55,170
the opposite I'm here to liberate men of

685
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:57,000
sophisticated taste from society's cruel

686
00:25:55,170 --> 00:25:59,190
and unjust prejudice against their tea

687
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,470
girl loving ways the liberation begins

688
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:02,700
with understanding so who are the men

689
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:04,260
who love trans girls

690
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:05,730
well according to trans women I've

691
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:08,790
talked to in my own personal experience

692
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:11,640
the Meno datas can be divided into three

693
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:14,250
general groups Group one are men who to

694
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:16,350
be honest or actually kind of put off by

695
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:18,000
the dick but they're so attracted to the

696
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:20,010
woman it's attached to that they're

697
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:24,300
willing to work around it or wait for it

698
00:26:20,010 --> 00:26:26,130
to grow on them group two are men who

699
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:27,540
are attracted to trans women including

700
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:30,150
their penises but they don't

701
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:31,980
specifically fetishize the penis so they

702
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:33,690
wouldn't mind if they're trans lover had

703
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:35,220
genital reassignment and got a vagina

704
00:26:33,690 --> 00:26:37,680
and then group three or a man who

705
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:39,570
specifically fetishize chicks with dicks

706
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:41,550
and often want to worship the pain

707
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:43,290
answer be penetrated by it now Group

708
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:45,720
three or where the trans community calls

709
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:47,700
chasers stating chasers is generally a

710
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:49,860
bad idea because their attraction to us

711
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:51,630
is based around fetishizing or genitals

712
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:53,760
which is often the part of us that were

713
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:55,350
most uncomfortable with so if you're a t

714
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:57,510
girl who likes men and group two is

715
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:59,400
really Goldilocks perfection unless you

716
00:26:57,510 --> 00:27:01,170
really like topping or you found the

717
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:02,970
surgery now I should say that group two

718
00:27:01,170 --> 00:27:04,950
does include some bisexual men and

719
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:06,930
bisexual people of either gender can be

720
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:09,090
great partners if you're trans you like

721
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:11,460
girls you like dick I'm a girl with a

722
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:12,930
deck let's make this happen that said if

723
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:15,060
someone views that part of me as male

724
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:15,540
and wants me to do with it but man deal

725
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:17,970
with it

726
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:19,740
then pass not interested now you might

727
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:22,920
be wondering what is this postmodern

728
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:24,570
neo-marxist SJW insanity how can i view

729
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:26,670
it as anything other than a male part

730
00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:28,580
it's a [ __ ] penis well I'm glad you

731
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:31,500
asked I always jump at the opportunity

732
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:33,600
to enlighten someone about the X disease

733
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:35,520
of the feminine penis you see there are

734
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:38,970
three factors that make a penis feminine

735
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:41,580
context usage and physiology so first

736
00:27:38,970 --> 00:27:44,220
context picture and your mind's eye a

737
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:44,930
feminine woman now picture her with a

738
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:46,910
penis

739
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:49,100
that's not a man's penis that's a

740
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:51,590
woman's penis it's feminine because of

741
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:54,530
the context without it's in second usage

742
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:57,260
a lesson and penis etiquette it

743
00:27:54,530 --> 00:27:59,780
gentlemen need not be coy about his

744
00:27:57,260 --> 00:28:02,210
penis he may flaunt he may brandish he

745
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:05,530
may he may penetrate he may order you to

746
00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:05,530
get on your knees like a good girl

747
00:28:05,770 --> 00:28:11,240
whereas it is a truth universally

748
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:14,840
acknowledged that a lady of good

749
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:17,000
breeding never brandishes her penis when

750
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:19,130
she rises from the bath she covers it

751
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:21,050
gracefully with a demure hand

752
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:24,290
and when not in use she keeps it

753
00:28:21,050 --> 00:28:27,230
carefully stowed away here's how to tuck

754
00:28:24,290 --> 00:28:29,870
your penis like a lady the first step is

755
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:31,820
to put on a set of vicious stiletto

756
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:35,240
claws this doesn't make things any

757
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:37,370
easier but it does build character next

758
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:40,730
you want to take not one but two pairs

759
00:28:37,370 --> 00:28:43,490
of cotton lined poly spandex bikini cut

760
00:28:40,730 --> 00:28:45,530
panties at least one size too small and

761
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:48,380
pull them most of the way up your legs

762
00:28:45,530 --> 00:28:49,490
now there's just no way to put this

763
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:51,560
delicately my dears

764
00:28:49,490 --> 00:28:53,540
you're gonna take your claw and you're

765
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:55,700
gonna grab your scrotum and you're gonna

766
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:57,650
yank that bubblegum back into your peach

767
00:28:55,700 --> 00:29:00,020
crease now hold it back with one hand

768
00:28:57,650 --> 00:29:02,900
and with your other hand push your penis

769
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:04,580
back pressing those little legs up into

770
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:06,590
your pelvis bring your thighs together

771
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:09,170
to hold everything in place and then

772
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:11,450
pull your panties up front first then

773
00:29:09,170 --> 00:29:13,670
back run your hand over it to make sure

774
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:16,700
nothing's seeping out the sides and then

775
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:18,500
voila it's like it was never there for

776
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:20,960
more information you can purchase my

777
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:22,700
book talk your penis with a new foreword

778
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:24,800
by dr. Jordan Pete Peterson

779
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:27,230
I've never explained but the context and

780
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:29,360
the usage of the feminine penis so let

781
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:30,860
us now turn to physiology most people

782
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:33,080
don't realize that taking feminizing

783
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:34,820
hormones actually changes the anatomy

784
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:37,340
and functionality of the genitals

785
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:39,680
shrinking everything down and softening

786
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:41,690
everything up that means changes to a

787
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:43,490
little thing not a lot of people are

788
00:29:41,690 --> 00:29:45,080
talking about but something I've been

789
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:47,210
trying to raise awareness of you know

790
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:52,100
start a conversation open a dialogue

791
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:53,610
really get people talking about 7 the

792
00:29:52,100 --> 00:30:01,200
mouthfeel

793
00:29:53,610 --> 00:30:04,740
oh hi it's me Natalie when you're

794
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:09,420
tasting specialist I have tasted

795
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:12,780
everything the Royal Flush oral sex girl

796
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:14,850
deck boy dick girl [ __ ]

797
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:18,180
and let us not forget about the

798
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:21,150
masculine clitoris but today we amuse

799
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:24,150
the palate with the feminine penis now

800
00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:26,250
with respect to flavor the feminine

801
00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:28,950
penis has more sweetness in the

802
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:31,440
masculine penis and fewer truffle mousse

803
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:37,560
while retaining the fundamental dick

804
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:40,020
umami with respect to mouthfeel the

805
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:42,090
feminine penis is of course softer and

806
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:45,060
smoother than the masculine penis and

807
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:48,090
does not become as urgent and as for the

808
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:51,210
common taste well it is a known fact

809
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:52,620
that girl come is clear liquid and

810
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:56,160
tastes of saline

811
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:58,710
whereas boy come is milky viscous and

812
00:30:56,160 --> 00:31:02,340
more acidic it is therefore the

813
00:30:58,710 --> 00:31:06,600
consensus among sommeliers that sucking

814
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:13,249
a female penis is not gay Cheers

815
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:17,279
[Music]

816
00:31:13,249 --> 00:31:18,299
eight being straight is pretty good so

817
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:20,070
I've been trying to clear up some

818
00:31:18,299 --> 00:31:22,470
misconceptions about sex with trans

819
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:24,210
women but ultimately you kind of just

820
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:26,999
need to try it yourself to fully

821
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:29,700
viscerally understand why sex through

822
00:31:26,999 --> 00:31:31,710
the trans women is sex with a woman now

823
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:34,110
we must always be wary of being overly

824
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:36,389
simplistic and are thinking sexuality is

825
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:38,159
complicated and while it's undeniable

826
00:31:36,389 --> 00:31:41,489
that many straight men are attracted to

827
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:43,559
trans women the messy reality is that a

828
00:31:41,489 --> 00:31:45,419
lot of straight men are also attracted

829
00:31:43,559 --> 00:31:47,399
to male Kroft stressors before I

830
00:31:45,419 --> 00:31:49,350
transition I was a crossdresser and I

831
00:31:47,399 --> 00:31:51,419
didn't present super womanly either like

832
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:53,700
fully doctor Frankenberger

833
00:31:51,419 --> 00:31:55,470
and that's why I'm so iconic I showed

834
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:57,720
the world that in two years you can

835
00:31:55,470 --> 00:32:01,019
transition from literally dr. Franken

836
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:02,730
for her to a very real very biological

837
00:32:01,019 --> 00:32:04,739
drag queen but even when I was that

838
00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:07,590
baritone voice transvestite

839
00:32:04,739 --> 00:32:09,269
I still got semi regular messages from

840
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:11,429
Matt and being like though I'm a

841
00:32:09,269 --> 00:32:13,619
straight man but I'm like really

842
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:16,200
attracted to you and you trust as a

843
00:32:13,619 --> 00:32:18,690
woman and it's really making me question

844
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:20,730
my sexuality now I could flatter myself

845
00:32:18,690 --> 00:32:22,529
with some kind of retcon and be like

846
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:24,659
well maybe those men just picked up am i

847
00:32:22,529 --> 00:32:26,639
inherently womanly female energy

848
00:32:24,659 --> 00:32:29,039
innocence that I've always had since I

849
00:32:26,639 --> 00:32:30,869
was born a female and biological soul

850
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:33,119
trapped in the body of a cross-dressing

851
00:32:30,869 --> 00:32:34,200
baby but let's be real there are

852
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:35,940
straight men have thought of cross

853
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:37,499
dressers they're straight men who [ __ ]

854
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:40,200
drag queens there are straight

855
00:32:37,499 --> 00:32:42,509
identifying men who [ __ ] other straight

856
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:44,580
identifying men what is going on here

857
00:32:42,509 --> 00:32:45,809
straight man what is your deal who are

858
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:47,489
you what is your life

859
00:32:45,809 --> 00:32:50,129
how does she become straight do they

860
00:32:47,489 --> 00:32:51,809
recruit you were you grilled I blame the

861
00:32:50,129 --> 00:32:53,669
parents let's go back to the game you

862
00:32:51,809 --> 00:32:56,129
guys like to play the one I call is this

863
00:32:53,669 --> 00:32:58,379
gay the commonly understood definition

864
00:32:56,129 --> 00:33:00,059
of homosexual acts is that their sex

865
00:32:58,379 --> 00:33:02,309
acts between people of the same gender

866
00:33:00,059 --> 00:33:04,409
but I've heard men argue that if a woman

867
00:33:02,309 --> 00:33:06,450
puts on a strap-on and takes a guy then

868
00:33:04,409 --> 00:33:08,730
that's gay or that it's gay if a man

869
00:33:06,450 --> 00:33:10,590
enjoys a woman touching his nipples to

870
00:33:08,730 --> 00:33:13,409
be clear we're talking about one man and

871
00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:15,600
one woman Eve sucking Adam's nipples and

872
00:33:13,409 --> 00:33:17,609
according to these men it's totally gay

873
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:20,309
with that shoes is that the idea of

874
00:33:17,609 --> 00:33:22,200
heterosexuality includes much more than

875
00:33:20,309 --> 00:33:24,360
just sex between a man and a woman it

876
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:26,460
actually encompasses a complex series of

877
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:28,500
rituals that must be performed by people

878
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:30,270
who have claimed the correct roles so if

879
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:32,340
a man deviates from his assigned part

880
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:34,260
and he approved bedroom activities then

881
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:36,750
according to this very fragile view of

882
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:38,520
heterosexuality he ceases to be strange

883
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:40,740
even a man's own relationship with his

884
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:43,140
body is policed by these narrow confines

885
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:45,450
for instance some men won't even wash

886
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:47,970
their own [ __ ] for fear that some

887
00:33:45,450 --> 00:33:50,700
involuntary twinge of anal pleasure

888
00:33:47,970 --> 00:33:53,010
might transform them irrevocably into

889
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:54,450
raving homos I mean to be fair before I

890
00:33:53,010 --> 00:33:55,799
washed my [ __ ] I was a quarterback

891
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:59,250
now I'm a cheerleader

892
00:33:55,799 --> 00:34:01,679
Vict ry don't tell the coach I was a guy

893
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:03,540
this obsession with the details of what

894
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:05,730
sex is allowed and what prohibited

895
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:07,919
reminds me of what psychologist Jonathan

896
00:34:05,730 --> 00:34:10,350
Hite calls an ethics of purity and

897
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:12,030
degradation basically it's a style of

898
00:34:10,350 --> 00:34:13,980
neural thinking that treats the body

899
00:34:12,030 --> 00:34:15,899
like a temple if I must be protected

900
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:18,000
from desecration which means you have to

901
00:34:15,899 --> 00:34:19,889
obey laws about how you can [ __ ] and

902
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,629
what you can eat so for example

903
00:34:19,889 --> 00:34:24,179
religious dietary laws

904
00:34:21,629 --> 00:34:27,000
I think this hyper-masculine hetero man

905
00:34:24,179 --> 00:34:29,040
code is basically an ethics of purity a

906
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:31,679
kind of kosher law governing

907
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:33,540
straightness and the is this gay game is

908
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:35,190
his theology now this whole line of

909
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:37,590
thinking has been reduced to absurdity

910
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:39,690
pretty effectively by of all people

911
00:34:37,590 --> 00:34:42,119
count thank you law if you class

912
00:34:39,690 --> 00:34:44,669
yourself as a straight man I'm Jill

913
00:34:42,119 --> 00:34:47,280
masturbating that means that you're

914
00:34:44,669 --> 00:34:50,369
touching a deck and that's key

915
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:52,200
well memed my lord where it means the

916
00:34:50,369 --> 00:34:54,210
pinnacle of the whole conversation is

917
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:56,790
reached when Dan Keeler concludes that

918
00:34:54,210 --> 00:34:59,430
since a woman inherits half her DNA from

919
00:34:56,790 --> 00:35:01,500
her father she's technically half a man

920
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:04,650
and therefore having sex with a woman

921
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:07,380
it's pretty gay obviously this is

922
00:35:04,650 --> 00:35:09,300
shitposting but it's logically just as

923
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:11,369
good an argument as traps are gay

924
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:13,619
because chromosomes so I think what we

925
00:35:11,369 --> 00:35:16,290
have here is a very bad theory about

926
00:35:13,619 --> 00:35:21,150
what it is to be gay so what is being

927
00:35:16,290 --> 00:35:24,869
gay Socrates on second thought I don't

928
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:26,790
know her 9 being gay is good actually

929
00:35:24,869 --> 00:35:28,230
sometimes when you've been arguing about

930
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:30,480
something for more than half an hour

931
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:32,040
it's good to take a step back and ask

932
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:33,900
yourself why are we even asking this

933
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:35,550
question in the first place why does it

934
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:37,620
even matter whether attraction

935
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:40,020
gay or straight it seems like the most

936
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:42,570
pressing reason is that a lot of men

937
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:44,970
equates straightness with manhood and

938
00:35:42,570 --> 00:35:47,550
they defend their manhood at all costs

939
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:49,140
now men this might be difficult to hear

940
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:52,020
and maybe you don't want to hear it from

941
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:54,000
me but this idea of manhood is hurting

942
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:55,560
you and it's hurting since women and

943
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,570
it's hurting trans women and it's

944
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:59,760
hurting gay people for one thing it

945
00:35:57,570 --> 00:36:01,590
makes you really really bad at sex who

946
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:03,600
wants to sleep with a guy who is so hung

947
00:36:01,590 --> 00:36:05,760
up on homophobic paranoia that he can't

948
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:07,650
even enjoy his own body having your

949
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:10,020
nipples sucked does not make you gay

950
00:36:07,650 --> 00:36:13,050
being pegged does not make you gay

951
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:16,260
sucking another man's dick just to try

952
00:36:13,050 --> 00:36:18,030
it does not make you gay and why because

953
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:21,120
being gay is a socially constructed

954
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:23,280
identity defined as a type of person

955
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:24,420
who's persistently attracted to people

956
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:26,220
of the same gender

957
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:27,840
if you're persistently attracted to

958
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:30,090
people of the same gender and you

959
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:32,910
identify with the word gay then you're

960
00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:34,770
gay if not then you're not and nothing

961
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:36,600
you can do will change that so that's

962
00:36:34,770 --> 00:36:39,090
one reason to stop worrying about this

963
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:40,890
and reason to is that being gay is good

964
00:36:39,090 --> 00:36:42,510
actually I mean why would you be worried

965
00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:44,670
about this if you didn't think being gay

966
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:47,670
was bad now I don't identify as gay

967
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:51,450
except in some pan LGBT cultural sense

968
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:54,000
we the gay but as a queer person I can't

969
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:56,460
help but be a little bit wounded by the

970
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:59,010
fact that straight men are so obsessed

971
00:36:56,460 --> 00:37:01,290
with proving that they aren't like us

972
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:03,270
but that is not a wound I'm going to

973
00:37:01,290 --> 00:37:05,670
dwell on because life is much too short

974
00:37:03,270 --> 00:37:08,550
for me to waste any more time processing

975
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:12,360
your homophobic baggage or traps gay

976
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:14,370
baby who cares just to it feels good

977
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:16,590
that's the simple answer but the truth

978
00:37:14,370 --> 00:37:17,820
is that when people say craps are gay

979
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:20,250
but there's nothing wrong with being gay

980
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:22,410
that is nothing but a sneaky attempt to

981
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:25,410
call trans women men and to reinforce

982
00:37:22,410 --> 00:37:27,480
the stigma against dating us among the

983
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:29,970
group of people who are in fact most

984
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:32,130
attracted to us because it is mostly

985
00:37:29,970 --> 00:37:35,010
straight men and not gay men who like us

986
00:37:32,130 --> 00:37:36,810
in the gay stigma is the reason why only

987
00:37:35,010 --> 00:37:38,940
a small fraction of the men who were

988
00:37:36,810 --> 00:37:41,820
attracted to us are willing to openly

989
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:43,560
date us and the stigma is very real a

990
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:46,320
straight man who date's a trans woman

991
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:48,410
takes on some of the burden of queerness

992
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:50,630
men who date us can be mocked

993
00:37:48,410 --> 00:37:53,300
other men they can be rejected by their

994
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:56,000
families they experience and short a

995
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:59,330
sample of the difficulty all queer

996
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:01,610
people face but a real man in my opinion

997
00:37:59,330 --> 00:38:03,950
is not the kind of man who lets other

998
00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:06,680
people's prejudices control his life a

999
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:08,930
real man does not act like an insecure

1000
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:09,860
little boy afraid of what people will

1001
00:38:08,930 --> 00:38:12,860
say about him

1002
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:16,850
a real man owns what he likes and is not

1003
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:20,540
ashamed of the women he loves and so my

1004
00:38:16,850 --> 00:38:23,720
edgy little boys by that measure I may

1005
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:26,890
be a woman but I'm still more of man

1006
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:26,890
than you

1007
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:41,230
ten I have feelings too well I guess

1008
00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:43,930
today we learned that our traps gay is

1009
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:46,059
not a debate worth winning because just

1010
00:38:43,930 --> 00:38:48,280
by participating we're accepting the

1011
00:38:46,059 --> 00:38:50,410
validity of an innocence e'er question

1012
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:52,960
and the bigoted assumptions that relies

1013
00:38:50,410 --> 00:38:54,760
on now some harsh words have been said

1014
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:57,010
about men tonight and I think that

1015
00:38:54,760 --> 00:39:00,039
harshness is deserved hashtag not all

1016
00:38:57,010 --> 00:39:02,500
gamers but also this video completely

1017
00:39:00,039 --> 00:39:04,630
centers men's feelings and I have

1018
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:06,430
feelings too god damn it and some of

1019
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:08,500
those feelings are not all that

1020
00:39:06,430 --> 00:39:12,609
different from the anxieties men have

1021
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:14,829
let me explain let me explain

1022
00:39:12,609 --> 00:39:17,109
so I identify my sexuality as queer and

1023
00:39:14,829 --> 00:39:18,990
poly which in my case is politically

1024
00:39:17,109 --> 00:39:21,579
correct terminology for confused [ __ ]

1025
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:23,920
before I transitioned I dated women and

1026
00:39:21,579 --> 00:39:26,829
I still do have less specious and less

1027
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:28,690
bonaga feelings but early on my

1028
00:39:26,829 --> 00:39:30,910
transition I encountered a lot of turf

1029
00:39:28,690 --> 00:39:32,859
[ __ ] and it really scared me off dating

1030
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:35,049
sis lesbians which I never have even

1031
00:39:32,859 --> 00:39:36,760
before I transitioned the question do I

1032
00:39:35,049 --> 00:39:38,890
want to [ __ ] men have been in the back

1033
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:39,800
of my head for a long time but about a

1034
00:39:38,890 --> 00:39:42,280
year ago I was like

1035
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:45,380
[Music]

1036
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:47,390
how to [ __ ] men but when I first started

1037
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:49,670
messing around with men I mean I was

1038
00:39:47,390 --> 00:39:51,140
terrified because men are scary and in

1039
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:53,450
my early transition I'd only dated

1040
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:55,640
bisexual trans people and enemies and as

1041
00:39:53,450 --> 00:39:57,620
an aside some of those experiences were

1042
00:39:55,640 --> 00:40:00,380
really revelatory a person with a vagina

1043
00:39:57,620 --> 00:40:02,000
can be fully a man in bed that teaches

1044
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:03,290
you something about gender and might be

1045
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:06,530
harder to learn otherwise

1046
00:40:03,290 --> 00:40:08,540
and loving a trans woman like I still

1047
00:40:06,530 --> 00:40:11,330
sometimes do struggle to fully believe

1048
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:13,280
that I'm a real woman but to experience

1049
00:40:11,330 --> 00:40:15,560
another trans woman not just as a woman

1050
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:17,780
but as like the radiant model of

1051
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:19,790
womanhood that's an experience that's

1052
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:21,200
meant a lot to me and if you're

1053
00:40:19,790 --> 00:40:23,450
attracted to women and that's an

1054
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:25,250
experience you haven't had you're

1055
00:40:23,450 --> 00:40:27,350
missing out but what I was gonna say is

1056
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:28,880
bisexual trans and non-binary people are

1057
00:40:27,350 --> 00:40:30,590
a pretty safe group of people to date

1058
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:32,330
when you're early in transition because

1059
00:40:30,590 --> 00:40:33,890
they're pretty chill about anatomy and

1060
00:40:32,330 --> 00:40:36,050
presentation but if you're gonna date

1061
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:38,780
says headmen you need to be serving

1062
00:40:36,050 --> 00:40:40,670
women and I guess I don't need to but it

1063
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:42,470
doesn't hurt and I did wonder if I was

1064
00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:44,900
woman enough for it so the first couple

1065
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:46,520
of times I was so afraid I was like when

1066
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:49,340
I take my clothes off is he gonna think

1067
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:51,650
I'm a man basically my anxiety was our

1068
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:53,840
crops gay but what I ended up doing is

1069
00:40:51,650 --> 00:40:55,400
just working up to things gradually and

1070
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:57,650
of course you start by sucking dick

1071
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:59,390
that's very safe because like what

1072
00:40:57,650 --> 00:41:02,030
red-blooded man is gonna turn down a

1073
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:03,890
t-girl [ __ ] and it doesn't involve my

1074
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:06,050
junk in any way then I got a little

1075
00:41:03,890 --> 00:41:08,090
bolder and I got with a guy who like

1076
00:41:06,050 --> 00:41:10,730
years before I transitioned we'd been

1077
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:12,200
guy friends so to then have a sexual

1078
00:41:10,730 --> 00:41:14,960
experience where it was very much

1079
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:17,240
between a man and a woman like that [ __ ]

1080
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:18,830
is super hot recently I took what seemed

1081
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:20,980
like the biggest risk and I let a

1082
00:41:18,830 --> 00:41:23,830
straight guy go down on me

1083
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:25,240
so nervous about that because like what

1084
00:41:23,830 --> 00:41:27,730
if he thinks I'm a man what if he's

1085
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:30,250
repulsed can you feel like a woman while

1086
00:41:27,730 --> 00:41:34,840
your dick is being sucked the answer is

1087
00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:36,970
yes it was so hot I loved it he loved it

1088
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:40,109
and just knowing that he'd never done

1089
00:41:36,970 --> 00:41:43,869
that before but I would say it's special

1090
00:41:40,109 --> 00:41:47,050
10 out of 10 and you know what he told

1091
00:41:43,869 --> 00:41:49,510
me after he told me he liked the

1092
00:41:47,050 --> 00:41:52,900
mouthfeel everyone's talking about it

1093
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:55,000
now [ __ ] so look I really don't want

1094
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:57,640
to shame men for being anxious about

1095
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:59,920
dating trans women because I mean I was

1096
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:02,200
anxious to in the other direction but I

1097
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:04,000
do wanna shame man for treating trans

1098
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:06,580
women like their dirty little secrets

1099
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:08,200
and I do on a shame man for dehumanizing

1100
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:10,480
us and voting away our rights my day

1101
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:12,490
well jerking off to [ __ ] foreign by

1102
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:14,050
night and I do wanna shame man for

1103
00:42:12,490 --> 00:42:16,330
refusing to date us because they're not

1104
00:42:14,050 --> 00:42:18,400
[ __ ] strong enough to shoulder one

1105
00:42:16,330 --> 00:42:20,710
hundredth of the burden of stigma that

1106
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:22,840
every trans woman carries every moment

1107
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:25,150
of every day and I do want a shame men

1108
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:26,650
for attacking their trans girlfriends

1109
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:28,600
because they couldn't stand being

1110
00:42:26,650 --> 00:42:31,990
treated like a gay man for five minutes

1111
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:34,030
that is pathetic if you're so worried

1112
00:42:31,990 --> 00:42:36,220
about proving you're a man why don't you

1113
00:42:34,030 --> 00:42:38,530
start by standing up for the women you

1114
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:41,350
love you [ __ ] cowards

1115
00:42:38,530 --> 00:42:43,990
so look what I'm asking for is so basic

1116
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:45,820
don't call human beings traps if here

1117
00:42:43,990 --> 00:42:48,940
trying to trans women don't be ashamed

1118
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:51,070
of it it's okay you can date us or more

1119
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:53,140
than just jackoff material if you aren't

1120
00:42:51,070 --> 00:42:54,940
attracted to trans women respect the

1121
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:55,420
people who are if you do date a trans

1122
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:57,160
woman

1123
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:58,960
treat her like a princess because God

1124
00:42:57,160 --> 00:43:01,960
knows she's been through enough [ __ ] and

1125
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:03,280
finally protect trans women of color at

1126
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:05,470
all costs

1127
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:09,910
all we want here is basic human decency

1128
00:43:05,470 --> 00:43:15,040
is that really too much to ask well this

1129
00:43:09,910 --> 00:43:18,000
is the internet so yes yes it is god

1130
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:18,000
damn it

1131
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:29,650
well that was long

1132
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:32,859
I suppose the lesson his as Sigmund

1133
00:43:29,650 --> 00:43:34,760
Freud once said sometimes a cigar is

1134
00:43:32,859 --> 00:43:37,919
just a beautiful woman's
