[Music]

00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,320
all right

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:13,840
so what are we looking at what new hell

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,599
have we sunk to now

5
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,880
here in the united states if they ask

6
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:18,400
you how you are you just have to say

7
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,840
that you're fine and you're not really

8
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,760
fine but you just can't get into it

9
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:24,480
because they would never understand well

10
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,920
it's a kentucky police patrol car with a

11
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,640
blue lives matter

12
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,599
thin blue line punisher skull on the

13
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,800
hood

14
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:34,640
um there's a lot to unpack here

15
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,320
but let's stick to tradition and begin

16
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,480
by examining the skull

17
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,879
the skull is the symbol of the punisher

18
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,399
the marvel comics vigilante anti-hero

19
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:44,399
the punisher's real name is frank

20
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:46,079
castilloni but he changed it to frank

21
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,520
castle i guess because he's ashamed of

22
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,360
his sicilian heritage

23
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,120
disappointing frank castle is an

24
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,960
ex-marine whose wife and kids are

25
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,120
murdered by the mob leaving him an empty

26
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,039
husk of a man whose only consolation is

27
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,480
his obsession with revenge nia

28
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:00,160
there's been a lot of tv and movie

29
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,239
adaptations of the punisher and his

30
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,640
research for this video i did watch all

31
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:05,040
of them

32
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,680
and my conclusion is that the best one

33
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,840
is the 1989 version where dolph lundgren

34
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,760
dyes his hair black to pass his sicilian

35
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,680
and runs around naked and sweaty in the

36
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,520
sewers worshiping the god of vengeance

37
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:19,680
at a shrine of trash

38
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:23,280
you know just like the police do

39
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,479
number 60. hi i'm natalie creator of

40
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,880
catra points

41
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:28,799
and no i'm not a cat girl i'm a cat

42
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,119
woman i'm sorry you're intimidated by

43
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,960
that

44
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:32,400
look i'm tired of only being valued for

45
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,640
my petite

46
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,200
heterosexual body i'd like to be

47
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:41,840
recognized for my worth as a mother

48
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,840
as a wife and

49
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:46,320
as a woman with values just kidding i'm

50
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,200
trash

51
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,159
let's talk about justice oolu justice is

52
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,439
when i get

53
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:55,439
lots of headphones the punisher's main

54
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:56,560
quest is to kill all the mobsters who

55
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:58,719
murdered his family

56
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,320
but once he gets revenge he can't stop

57
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,719
killing because it's the only thing that

58
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,040
gives

59
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:05,600
meaning to his shitty life so he wages a

60
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:07,600
one-man war on organized crime but no

61
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,000
matter how many bad guys he kills it's

62
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,319
never

63
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,959
enough because new criminals just come

64
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:15,599
along and take the place of the old ones

65
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,000
it's like a cycle where violent city

66
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:18,800
gets

67
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,680
violence and nothing ever really changes

68
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,520
it's almost

69
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,280
like this comic book is trying to tell

70
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,239
us something about the nature of crime

71
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,760
and punishment

72
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:28,560
but you know what let's not overthink

73
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,040
this sure just slap a giant skull on the

74
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,840
car

75
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,519
great perfect are we the baddies look

76
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,959
maybe you're assuming i'm one of these

77
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:40,080
lib tarted antifa sympathizing

78
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:42,720
big government anarchists who sits

79
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,640
behind my iphone with my latte

80
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,400
criticizing the police even though i

81
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,599
could never do a job one-tenth as

82
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,560
difficult as theirs

83
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:52,080
and to that i say how dare you assume

84
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:55,120
things that are entirely correct

85
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,720
this is excuse me a damn fine cup of

86
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,159
coffee there's just nothing better than

87
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,440
waking up in the morning

88
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:01,200
and having the first dose of the

89
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:04,710
chemical you're addicted to they tried

90
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:06,480
to make me go to rehab i said

91
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:08,720
[Music]

92
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,640
you seem like a reasonable person a

93
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,560
person of science a

94
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,760
seasoned vendor at the free marketplace

95
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,080
of ideas gorge

96
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,519
and as a reasonable person i'm sure you

97
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,080
wouldn't dismiss my argument just

98
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:20,800
because

99
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,519
i happen to enjoy head paths as socrates

100
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,840
once said

101
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:25,920
two plus two is four is equally true

102
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,959
whether uttered by a philosopher king or

103
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:31,840
a peasant nave

104
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:34,400
or a neko mimi kawai daves

105
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:36,239
this problematic cringe culture is dead

106
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,040
and we have killed it this is beyond

107
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,680
cringe

108
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:41,440
this is cursed children cursed so

109
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,040
actually socrates didn't say this quote

110
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,200
i just made it up but

111
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,560
that just proves the point i'm making so

112
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,640
maybe you should hear me out

113
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,319
yeah i'm making this video at a time

114
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,080
when hundreds of videos of police

115
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:52,879
brutality are being shared on social

116
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,959
media

117
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:56,959
spurring on a movement to abolish police

118
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,840
and prisons and at the same time

119
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:01,200
there's a growing culture of online

120
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:03,040
vigilantism where justice is taken into

121
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,360
the hands of twitter mobs demanding

122
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,159
accountability and consequences for bad

123
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,400
behavior

124
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:09,519
all of this raises a lot of questions

125
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,519
questions like

126
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:13,120
what should the consequences be for bad

127
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,159
behavior who should impose these

128
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,320
consequences

129
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:17,359
and under what circumstances and for

130
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,759
what purpose

131
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:21,120
if we were to abolish police in prisons

132
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,800
what would take their place

133
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,840
oh my god these contacts i'm literally

134
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,759
doing a whole video with [ __ ]

135
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,199
sideways cat eyes ridiculous

136
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:30,400
why don't we start with the basics and

137
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:31,919
ask ourselves what is justice socrates

138
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,759
it's a question philosophers have

139
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:37,360
pondered for thousands of years

140
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:37,360
with no conclusive answers

141
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,880
i think i can probably figure this out

142
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,560
in a youtube video because the

143
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:47,040
philosophers were dummies

144
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:50,400
and i am very smart rah-rah rasputin

145
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:53,360
one revenge the punisher represents a

146
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:55,440
particular idea about what justice is

147
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,440
symbolized by the skull he wears on his

148
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:00,240
t-shirt so that bad guys know

149
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:02,240
they're about to get punished the

150
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,320
punisher's view is that justice means

151
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,320
harming people who harm people

152
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,840
an eye for an eye this is called

153
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,919
retributive justice

154
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,080
the idea that people who commit crimes

155
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:12,960
deserve punishment in proportion to

156
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,440
their crime

157
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,800
it's a very emotionally powerful idea of

158
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,800
what justice is

159
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,039
because it's rooted in our instinct to

160
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,479
strike back at someone who's harmed us

161
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:25,280
social animals like humans and

162
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:26,639
chimpanzees often practice revenge

163
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,800
probably because it serves an

164
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:31,039
evolutionary function if another monkey

165
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,880
in your monkey troop steals your bananas

166
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:34,800
and you don't get revenge then other

167
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,360
monkeys will learn that you're a doormat

168
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,360
monkey

169
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,720
but if you get revenge on the thief

170
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,560
monkey by

171
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,400
i don't know letting her boyfriend pick

172
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,320
parasites out of your fur

173
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,840
then that sends a message to the other

174
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:48,400
monkeys that it is not

175
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,680
profitable to mess with you so our

176
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,840
little monkey brains

177
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,600
have evolved a taste for vengeance and

178
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,479
even in cases where it doesn't actually

179
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,199
benefit us

180
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:58,479
our desire for retribution is strong and

181
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:00,639
our little monkey brains

182
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,680
reward us with a pleasant feeling of

183
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:04,639
catharsis

184
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,360
when justice of this kind is served so

185
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:07,360
of course

186
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,800
there's a lot of content out there

187
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,520
devoted to scratching this

188
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:13,919
itch for example there's a subreddit

189
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,759
called r slash justice served with one

190
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:17,520
and a half million subscribers

191
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:20,160
i first found justice search when the

192
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,360
popular feed showed me this post of two

193
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,680
teenage thieves

194
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,720
stripped naked humiliated and

195
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,960
photographed as

196
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:29,360
punishment and all this celebrated under

197
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:31,120
the heading police justice

198
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,479
in fact before the murder of george

199
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,720
floyd by police

200
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:35,600
the description of the community was now

201
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:39,680

202
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:43,199
more police brutality um fun fact

203
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:45,360

to justice served right away thinking

206
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,120
someone should be keeping an eye on

207
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:52,080
these people here's a typical justice

208
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,360
surge post

209
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:58,720
woman sets p-e-d-o husband on

210
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:01,840
fire after catching him r-a-p-e

211
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:03,759
seven-year-old daughter titled this man

213
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:08,720
instant regret predator exposed to be

214
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:09,919
honest when i wrote this part of the

215
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,520
script i forgot i was going to be

216
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:12,720
wearing carriers i'm really out here

217
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,560
trying to have a conversation about

218
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:18,240
immolating sex offenders while

219
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:21,599
dressed like a aging bargain bin

220
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:24,080
bell delphine impersonator well

221
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:26,080
dress for the job you want i mean humsta

222
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:28,240
amongst us wouldn't set their husband on

223
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,680
fire under those circumstances right

224
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,080
let's look at the comments on that post

225
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:34,319
though let's read the room

226
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:36,160
she's a hero in my opinion should have

227
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:38,960
had it live on television

228
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,479
give her a medal give her two medals so

229
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,599
most people are in favor of setting

230
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:43,520
predators ablaze

231
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:45,680
but you know there's always a couple

232
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,400
buzz kills in there whining as usual

233
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,800
about

234
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:51,120
oh maybe we shouldn't be cheering on

235
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,080
burning people alive with no due process

236
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,080
and no evidence

237
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:56,160
lots of men like to [ __ ] my wife because

238
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,680
i'm too busy crying about due process

239
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,479
but those people get shouted down pretty

240
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:02,240
fast

241
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:04,560
they get called pedo simps pedo

242
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,160
so justice served is a community for

243
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,160
people to gather together

244
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,759
and bond over our shared love of

245
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,080
extrajudicial violence

246
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:13,919
but of course there's always someone who

247
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,919
takes it a little too far

248
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:18,319
on this video of a thief being kicked in

249
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:20,879
the head until his face is a bloody pulp

250
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:22,240
one commenter says that's a justice

251
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:24,319
boner for me

252
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,759
i dream of the day i catch the thieves

253
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:29,360
that stole from me

254
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:32,399
and kicked the life out of them criminal

255
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:34,640
fail prank gone wrong so

256
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:38,000
when the righteous zeal for justice

257
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:40,560
becomes the cloak of bloodlust

258
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,560
that is off-putting to some people as

259
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,680
one disgruntled former justice service

260
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,760
subscriber put it

261
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:47,760
i wanted to see stories and videos of

262
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:51,200
[ __ ] getting their comeuppance

263
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:53,760
instead i got bombarded with an angry

264
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,959
toxic moral absolutism everything is

265
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,959
black and white with them

266
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:58,080
if you don't support mutilating someone

267
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:00,000
beyond repair

268
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:02,000
then you must support giving them a slap

269
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,760
on the wrist and letting them [ __ ] your

270
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,200
wife

271
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:07,519
unsubscribed but even this liberal

272
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,279
cuckold still wanted to watch

273
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:11,360
videos of [ __ ] getting their

274
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:11,680
comeuppance i think pretty much everyone

275
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,480
is

276
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,680
capable of enjoying some version of this

277
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,680
type of content

278
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,880
there's a lot of sub genres you've got

279
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:21,200
justice porn

280
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,560
play stupid games win stupid prizes

281
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:26,880
instant karma

282
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:28,959
bad parking revenge predator poaching

283
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,320
serial killer sentenced to death and the

284
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:34,160
whole train clapped

285
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:36,640
instant justice was served karma fails

286
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,279
stupid people getting what they deserved

287
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,680
karma

288
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:40,959
a lot of this content has kind of a

289
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,680
right-wing feel to it

290
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:45,360
unmarked police justice criminal gets

291
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:48,480
shot after fighting cop

292
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:52,240
home invader takes shotgun blast to the

293
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:54,160
balls arizona just arizona

294
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,600
what more is there to say arizona

295
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:58,480
justice served

296
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:00,480
punished it reminds me of nra people who

297
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,000
spend 10 hours a day fantasizing about

298
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,680
how they're gonna kill home intruders

299
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,120
with the gun they keep in the bathroom

300
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:07,680
but i don't think this longing for

301
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:09,600
retribution is distinctively right-wing

302
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:11,200
left-wing people have the exact same

303
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,320
emotional response

304
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,040
they just have it in different

305
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,600
situations think about the jubilation on

306
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,000
twitter

307
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,200
when they get a racist care and fired

308
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,040
remember that ugly hug

309
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,120
lisa who harassed a black man in front

310
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:26,399
of an apartment building

311
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:27,839
karma and she got her husband fired

312
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:29,680
dumb [ __ ] really should have minded her

313
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:32,079
business love to see it

314
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,800
she will probably end up with community

315
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:35,360
service

316
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,079
and a fine but i would love to see her

317
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,360
in jail

318
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:40,320
for at least six months firing them was

319
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,519
not enough

320
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:47,920
life in prison

321
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:50,720
life in prison an example i personally

322
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:52,640
enjoy is that video of daniel holtzclaw

323
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,399
the cop who abused his power to sexually

324
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:56,320
assault a series of black women

325
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:59,860
crying in court as he's sentenced to

326
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:01,279
serve 263 years in prison

327
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:02,800
[Music]

328
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:04,640
he just cannot believe that he's

329
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,720
actually facing consequences for this

330
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,680
and of course there's the much savered

331
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:13,360
the vigilante punching of

332
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:15,120
nazi richard spencer let's watch it now

333
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,480
please try not to enjoy this remember

334
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:20,480
this is purely for

335
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:24,640
educational monetizable purposes

336
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,640
it's uh pepe has become kind of a symbol

337
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:30,320
that was informative but let's be honest

338
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:35,040
the reason that video was so popular

339
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:38,079
is people just enjoyed watching an nazi

340
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:41,920
get what he deserves justice

341
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:43,200
served punished smashing very happy they

342
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:46,560
found

343
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,440
remember to smash subscribe so this

344
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,760
punitive

345
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,279
retributive impulse no matter how

346
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:54,399
righteous it feels

347
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:57,120
is still basically a situational form

348
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:59,279
of sadism of shot and freuda the

349
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:02,160
satisfaction of justice served

350
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:03,120
is the pleasure we take in inflicting or

351
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:06,240
witnessing

352
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:09,440
the suffering of someone who deserves it

353
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,639
now the phrase deserves it is doing a

354
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,399
lot of work here

355
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:13,680
the correct use of that phrase is the

356
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:15,279
difference between a morally

357
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:17,040
well-adjusted person

358
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:19,920
and someone who's hiding bodies in the

359
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:23,680
crawl space it puts the lotion on its

360
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:26,240
skin yeah but people generally agree

361
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:27,600
that those who harm others deserve to be

362
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,920
harmed themselves

363
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,959
it's why we love stories about revenge

364
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:34,000
stories like

365
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:36,959
mean girls the crow old boy

366
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,839
titus andronicus and matilda much too

367
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:39,839
good for children

368
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,880
revenge is such a popular plotline

369
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:47,200
because it's easy for people to identify

370
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:49,279
with a revenge seeking protagonist

371
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:51,440
and it's just the easiest way to hype

372
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:53,120
people up about spectacles of violence

373
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,920
this technique was used in one of the

374
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:57,839
first books ever the odyssey by homer

375
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:59,920
i stole this copy from my high school

376
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:01,680
and i stole this copy from my college

377
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:03,440
i still just read the spark notes well

378
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:06,720
let's read it now see

379
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:08,399
i knew this would be useful someday

380
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,000
god he's such a [ __ ] boy what does

381
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:12,320
athena see in this man

382
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,279
it must be really hot okay i'm ready for

383
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,160
my book report

384
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:17,680
so the hero of the story is odysseus and

385
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:19,120
the whole book is him

386
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:22,320
trying to get home to the island of

387
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:25,120
ithaca after um

388
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:27,279
okay so in the prequel odysseus shitty

389
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:29,440
friend menelaus throws a tantrum

390
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:30,800
after his wife leaves him to run off

391
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,320
with a turkish guy she was actually

392
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:35,440
attracted to how dare she

393
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:36,160
so menelaus dragged an entire nation to

394
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,920
war

395
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:40,079
instead of doing what any normal man

396
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,440
would do and blowing off some steam at

397
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:42,880
femboy symposium

398
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:45,199
anyway when odysseus finally gets back

399
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,079
to ithaca he finds that his house is

400
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:48,480
full of men

401
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:49,120
who are eating his food and drinking his

402
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,079
wine

403
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:54,000
and trying to marry his wife so odysseus

404
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:56,240
and this is the hero of our story here

405
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,040
he murders all of his wife's suitors as

406
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:00,160
payback

407
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:02,560
and then he rounds up all the slave

408
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,920
women who slept with the suitors and he

409
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:07,120
has them all hanged

410
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:09,199
and this one suitor valentius odysseus

411
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,880
ties him up and cuts off his ears and

412
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:13,440
nose and feet

413
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:14,320
and then rips off his genitals to feed

414
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,920
to the dogs

415
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:18,320
in reading this i guess i find myself

416
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:20,560
asking uh

417
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:23,120
was this really necessary like as a test

418
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:25,440
reader my feedback for homer is

419
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,720
maybe workshop this i mean super

420
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,240
unlikable protagonist

421
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,839
really kind of kills it for me i guess

422
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:32,079
it's a male protagonist and you can get

423
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:34,240
away with making them unlikable because

424
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:35,600
men love hearing about [ __ ] that's

425
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,600
why they watch my channel

426
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,760
but the crazy thing is i don't think

427
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,920
odysseus is supposed to be an [ __ ]

428
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,959
the text seems to approve of what he

429
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:46,160
does to the suitors

430
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:49,440
and to his uh his slaves

431
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:52,160
yikes disappointing casual reminder

432
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,959
that odysseus kills his slaves it isn't

433
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,800
a good look

434
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:56,800
wow this blew up i don't have a

435
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,680
soundcloud give me money oh my god this

436
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,920
contact

437
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,600
is fully horizontal this is the last

438
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,600
time we're doing cat eye contacts

439
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,279
[ __ ] this it just seems disproportionate

440
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,120
you know like it's not even eye for an

441
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:08,959
eye because the suitors didn't kill

442
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:11,040
anyone they were basically just

443
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:12,240
rude to odysseus but i guess you have to

444
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,680
understand this kind of thing in

445
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,519
cultural context

446
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:17,600
they came into his home and they

447
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:19,199
disrespected his wife and

448
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,880
probably she was into it but whatever

449
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:22,480
will play along so that was an affront

450
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:24,240
to odysseus's honor

451
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,480
and on the island of ithaca in the year

452
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:28,880
1000 to bc or whatever

453
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,720
honor was everything because this was a

454
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:33,920
pre-legal society

455
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:37,279
no laws no courts no cops schools out

456
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:38,880
[ __ ] 12. so honor

457
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:40,959
is a code of conduct enforced by

458
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:42,800
reputation and that's what kept people

459
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:43,279
from stealing and lying and murdering

460
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,360
each other

461
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:46,880
though it was also often the thing

462
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,560
causing them to murder each other

463
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,320
because back then honor was the only

464
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,279
thing protecting people from being taken

465
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,360
advantage of

466
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:55,279
if you're an ancient mycenean king then

467
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,959
someone invites themself into your house

468
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:57,839
and drinks your wine and seduces your

469
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:59,279
wife

470
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:01,360
well you can't let them get away with

471
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:02,079
that because then people will walk all

472
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,759
over you

473
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:06,240
so you need to get revenge to protect

474
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:08,399
your honor to maintain your reputation

475
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:10,720
as a person who is not to be messed with

476
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,839
it's also the point of hard masculinity

477
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,880
in honor cultures

478
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:17,680
heart masculinity is a defensive posture

479
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:18,399
an intimidating posture it showcases

480
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,959
strength

481
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:22,320
and hides vulnerability we call it toxic

482
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:24,720
masculinity now

483
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:26,480
because in our society it's destructive

484
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,160
and dysfunctional we've moved beyond the

485
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:30,320
need for this which is why it's possible

486
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:32,800
for me to exist if society collapses and

487
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:35,120
we go back to achilles and odysseus

488
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:36,000
i'm in danger i'm much too delicate for

489
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,480
this mycenaean

490
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,199
savagery back at homer's time might be

491
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,440
well

492
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:43,680
i'd be a slave at femme boy symposium

493
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:46,240
extremely sad gay sounds

494
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:48,160
neo but for people in situations where

495
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,279
appealing to community or state law

496
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:51,680
enforcement is not an

497
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:53,600
option such as kings of ancient

498
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:55,440
mediterranean islands or

499
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,720
gangsters who need to resolve conflicts

500
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,920
outside of the law

501
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,959
or wild west cowboys hard masculinity

502
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:03,120
has a function

503
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:05,360
it's a warning signal like a skull

504
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,160
t-shirt are the stripes on a poisonous

505
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:09,439
snake

506
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:10,160
and the poison is vengeance justice

507
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:12,640
served

508
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:14,559
so revenge is arguably the most basic

509
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,880
form of retributive justice

510
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:18,319
the philosopher francis bacon defined

511
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,480
revenge as a wild

512
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:22,720
justice according to the first paragraph

513
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:26,160
of the wikipedia article about revenge

514
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:27,439
research i am very smart nia but in most

515
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,679
modern legal systems

516
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:30,640
revenge is frowned upon and for pretty

517
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:32,320
good reasons

518
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,480
an eye for an eye will make the whole

519
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:36,400
world blind didn't you know that

520
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,600
if someone harms you and you get revenge

521
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,600
by killing him

522
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:41,120
then his family is gonna try to get

523
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:44,240
revenge by killing you

524
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:45,280
it's a cycle a cycle of smashing at the

525
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,120
end of the odyssey

526
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,480
the families of the suitors odysseus

527
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,320
killed band together

528
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,400
and plot to get revenge by killing

529
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:54,240
odysseus and literally the last thing

530
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,480
that happens in the odyssey is that the

531
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,000
goddess athena who has an inexplicable

532
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:01,120
lady boner for odysseus

533
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,360
steps in and saves him by just

534
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:04,559
making the families forget that odysseus

535
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:07,120
killed their children

536
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:08,720
so only divine intervention in amnesia

537
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:11,120
stops the cycle of violence

538
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:13,120
but in reality that doesn't happen very

539
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:14,000
much so these cycles can last for

540
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:16,400
decades or even

541
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,919
centuries in albania there's an ancient

542
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,919
code called the canon

543
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:21,520
which requires a family to commit murder

544
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:23,360
in order to preserve their honor when

545
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:25,600
another family offends against them

546
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:27,679
life for life blood for blood this

547
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:30,160
historically led to blood feuds between

548
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:32,080
families that could last for generations

549
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,760
and in fact it still sometimes happens

550
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,840
in parts of northern albania

551
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:37,600
there's documentaries on youtube about

552
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:39,360
families who are trapped at home

553
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:41,039
possibly for the rest of their lives

554
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,400
because there's a vendetta against them

555
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:44,559
and if they leave the house

556
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:46,640
they'll be murdered historically blood

557
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:47,360
feuds led to a high mortality rate for

558
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,880
young men

559
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,960
which may have contributed to the

560
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,240
tradition of what are called albanian

561
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,679
sworn virgins

562
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,679
these are assigned female at birth

563
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:57,840
people who would take a vow of chastity

564
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:59,679
in exchange for getting to live as men

565
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:01,520
there's still some of them around and in

566
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:03,039
a very patriarchal society they're

567
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:05,039
socially recognized as

568
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:07,280
men allowed to wear men's clothes use a

569
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:09,520
male name u act as head of a household

570
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:11,520
inherit family wealth and generally have

571
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:14,240
the rights and privileges of a man

572
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:16,080
extremely happy trans sounds ubu i bring

573
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,840
this up just because i think it shows

574
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,480
how devastating the blood feuds must

575
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,400
have been

576
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,559
because only desperation would lead a

577
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,160
european country hundreds of years ago

578
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:26,080
to support trans rights

579
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:27,360
no one wants that so you know it was a

580
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:29,520
last resort um

581
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:31,520
sworn virgins weren't transgender most

582
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:33,440
were compelled yeah i know that sweaty

583
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:35,679
it was just a joke okay calm down

584
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,320
revenge cycles also happen on a larger

585
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:39,520
scale

586
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:41,360
between communities nations ethnicities

587
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:43,440
religions i'm worried if i give a real

588
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,960
example i'll be canceled for seeming

589
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,559
neutral about a conflict where i'm

590
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:49,840
supposed to take a side

591
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:50,320
so in the interest of cowardice let's

592
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:54,000
say

593
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:55,760
that the cat girls bombed the dog girls

594
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,320
and then the dog girls bombed the cat

595
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:59,039
girls and that cycle repeats for a few

596
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,200
decades

597
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:02,960
and by that point both nations have such

598
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,120
a long and bitter list of grievances

599
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,559
against each other that reconciliation

600
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:09,760
is close to impossible

601
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:11,919
extremely angry gay sounds

602
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:13,679
so a revenge based code of honor is not

603
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:16,000
really an ideal justice system

604
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:16,720
it's bloody it's chaotic and it produces

605
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,960
these endless

606
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,640
cycles of violence so at some point in

607
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,480
the growth of a civilization

608
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:24,240
something has to be done to control the

609
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:26,400
chaos caused by vengeance

610
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:28,480
and the most popular way to do that is

611
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:31,600
to create a state legal system

612
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:33,760
two retribution the extremely heck and

613
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:36,559
cute and valid german sociologist

614
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:38,640
max weber defined the state as the

615
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:40,559
organization with a monopoly on the

616
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:43,360
legitimate use of violence

617
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:45,360
in an honor society with no rule of law

618
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:46,960
anyone is allowed to kill someone as

619
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,799
long as they do so in accordance with

620
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:51,039
the code of honor but once you have

621
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:52,159
the state usually only the government is

622
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:54,000
allowed to kill people

623
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:56,000
in ancient babylon there was a king

624
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,400
called hammurabi who enacted one of the

625
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,440
first

626
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:02,400
law codes in the world around 1750 bc

627
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:03,440
an era that scholars refer to as history

628
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,760
times

629
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:06,960
the code of hammurabi looked like this

630
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:09,120
the laws were

631
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:10,080
crudely scratched into this stone using

632
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,080
some

633
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:14,240
primitive attempt at writing i mean it

634
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:16,320
was like a thousand years ago so

635
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:18,000
i'm sure they were doing their best it's

636
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,679
very good sweetie

637
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,200
i'll hang it up on the refrigerator for

638
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:22,320
you are they supporting this replica to

639
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,640
be bigger

640
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:27,039
sort of a spinal tap stonehenge

641
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:29,280
situation

642
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:30,960
the actual hammurabi steelies were about

643
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:32,720
seven feet tall and they were publicly

644
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,919
placed in the city so that everyone knew

645
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,919
what the laws were

646
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:38,000
even though most people were illiterate

647
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:39,280
but hey they tried sort of let's read

648
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,000
some of hammurabi's laws

649
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:43,440
that's content right cat girl reacts to

650
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,400
the code of hammurabi

651
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,400
nia's queen

652
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:51,280
we don't deserve rights so there's 282

653
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:54,000
laws and they're all in if then

654
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:54,480
form so if you do x then the punishment

655
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,799
is why

656
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,559
law 22 if anyone is committing a robbery

657
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:59,840
and is caught then he shall be put to

658
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:01,919
death

659
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:03,679
that's extremely valid if a son of a

660
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:05,360
paramore or prostitute say to his

661
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:07,760
adoptive father or mother

662
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:09,120
you are not my father or my mother his

663
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,240
tongue shall be cut off

664
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,320
at least they're standing up for

665
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:13,840
adoptive parents if a man put out the

666
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:16,400
eye of another man

667
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:17,919
his eye shall be put out now we're

668
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:20,080
getting into some of the classics

669
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:21,440
if he breaks another man's bone his bone

670
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:23,520
shall be broken

671
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,880
if a freed man strike the body of

672
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:27,760
another freed man

673
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:29,919
he shall pay 10 shekels and money but if

674
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,960
the slave of a freed man strike the body

675
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:33,520
of a freed man

676
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,960
his ear shall be cut off oh so there's

677
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,679
different punishments for different

678
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,520
classes

679
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:39,520
so it's like our legal system except

680
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:41,120
honest if a builder built a house for

681
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,000
someone and does not construct it

682
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,600
properly

683
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,039
in the house which he will fall in and

684
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,960
kill its owner

685
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:49,200
then that builder shall be put to death

686
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:51,200
if it killed the son of the owner

687
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:53,120
the son of that builder shall be put to

688
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:55,280
death love that okay

689
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:56,960
so by modern standards the code of

690
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,559
hammurabi

691
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,240
does not pass the vibe check the

692
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:01,520
vibrations are very negative it's a lot

693
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,480
of cutting people's hands off and

694
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:04,880
burning them alive

695
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:06,720
just a major vibe killer all around but

696
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,720
you have to credit hammurabi's code

697
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:10,240
for resolving the problem of honor

698
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,679
driven revenge cycles

699
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:14,000
you know if you live in babylon and

700
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:15,360
someone harms you instead of retaliating

701
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,520
against their family and

702
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,559
potentially starting a generations long

703
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,480
blood feud

704
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:22,640
you take your grievance to the elders of

705
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:24,720
the city who reach a verdict and impose

706
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:26,640
a sentence just as served so the

707
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,840
involvement of a neutral third party is

708
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,400
one major difference

709
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:32,559
between vigilante revenge and a state

710
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,400
legal system of retributive justice

711
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:36,000
let's list all the differences revenge

712
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,919
is personal in the sense that

713
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,360
it's the victim who does the avenging

714
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:41,159
it's often emotional

715
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:43,600
an act of passion it can be

716
00:23:41,159 --> 00:23:44,480
disproportionate as an odysseus killing

717
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,240
the suitors for

718
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:49,039
squatting in his palace and it's

719
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:51,120
sadistic it's satisfying to the avenger

720
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:53,200
revenge is sweet on the other hand a

721
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:55,120
legal system of retributive justice

722
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:57,200
is impersonal in the sense that the

723
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:58,960
punishment is imposed by a third party

724
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:01,360
the state and not the victim

725
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:03,039
it's therefore disinterested so not in

726
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:05,360
theory motivated by emotion

727
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:06,080
and also lacking the sadism of sweet

728
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:09,200
revenge

729
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:11,279
it's also proportionate again in theory

730
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,880
you know an eye for an eye sounds brutal

731
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:15,120
but it's an eye for an eye

732
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:17,600
and no more than an eye and that could

733
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:19,600
be considered humane compared to say

734
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:21,520
revenge killing someone's family for an

735
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:23,520
eye and it's also consistent

736
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:25,200
so different offenders are supposed to

737
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:27,120
get the same punishment for the same

738
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,520
crime i mean unless you're rich in which

739
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,880
case

740
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:31,120
don't you even worry your little head

741
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:33,290
about it just pay some gold it's fine

742
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:34,799
girl these contacts like

743
00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:36,480
[Music]

744
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:38,320
so there are supposed to be these

745
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:40,559
differences between revenge and

746
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:42,720
retributive justice which is why it's so

747
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:44,880
inappropriate for law enforcement to

748
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,799
identify with the outlaw punisher

749
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:48,400
modern criminal sentencing accepts

750
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:50,799
retribution as a goal

751
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,600
while rejecting revenge as lawless

752
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:54,799
however

753
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:58,320
i feel that retribute of justice

754
00:24:54,799 --> 00:25:00,400
is still spiritually akin to revenge

755
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,360
it scratches the same emotional itch

756
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:04,320
it's basically

757
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:05,120
revenge by proxy if revenge is wild's

758
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:07,760
justice

759
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:08,559
then retributive justice is domesticated

760
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:11,120
revenge

761
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:12,880
in both cases there's a drive to restore

762
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:15,440
the moral order of things

763
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:17,120
to balance out the karma by harming the

764
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:19,760
person who caused harm

765
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:20,240
sometimes in a poetic justice kind of

766
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:22,000
way

767
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:24,400
like in the code of hammurabi there's

768
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,559
this symbolic retaliation

769
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,440
of punishing the body part that you

770
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:29,039
offended with

771
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,880
cutting off the hand that struck the

772
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:32,799
father cutting off the breasts of the

773
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:34,480
wet nurse who switched the babies

774
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:36,799
cutting out the tongue that renounced

775
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:38,000
its parents there's a kind of aesthetic

776
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:40,400
dimension to this

777
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,760
an appreciation for this symmetry of

778
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,760
punishment and crime

779
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:45,840
for a modern example here's a poetic

780
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,520
justice post from our slash instant

781
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,720
karma

782
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:50,880
mugshots.com puts people's mug shots

783
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,520
online and then demands payment to take

784
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,440
them down

785
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:55,840
the site's founders were just arrested

786
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,720
for extortion here are their mugshots

787
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:59,039
there's something

788
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,840
metaphysically pleasant about poetic

789
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:02,400
justice

790
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:03,919
this sense of beautiful cosmic harmony

791
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:06,080
and my guess is that this way of

792
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:08,159
thinking originates in some primeval

793
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,880
human instinct that's difficult to get

794
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:11,039
rid of

795
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:13,279
but that doesn't mean we shouldn't

796
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:15,279
question it the logic of retribution has

797
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:18,480
been questioned for thousands of years

798
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:21,679
by philosophers reformists

799
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:23,039
messiahs you know fancy people who think

800
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:25,840
they're too good to enjoy

801
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:27,120
violence one school of anti-retribution

802
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:29,360
thought we could call

803
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:31,600
the love and forgiveness school and the

804
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:33,600
main love and forgiveness guy

805
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:35,440
is a preachy lib you may have heard of

806
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:38,000
called jesus of nazareth

807
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:39,919
back in bible times the hebrews had laws

808
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,360
of retributive justice that were similar

809
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:43,360
to the code of hammurabi

810
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:45,039
like in the book of exodus god gives a

811
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:47,360
bunch of laws to moses

812
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:48,159
including some relaunches of hammurabi

813
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:50,000
classics

814
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:52,640
viewers at home may now open up your

815
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,080
bibles to exodus 21-22

816
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,760
if people are fighting and hit a

817
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:57,840
pregnant woman and she gives birth

818
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:59,760
prematurely but there is no serious

819
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:01,679
injury the offender must be fined

820
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,640
whatever the woman's husband demands in

821
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:04,720
the court allows

822
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:06,240
but if there is serious injury you are

823
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:08,960
to take life for life

824
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:09,520
eye for eye tooth for tooth hand for

825
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,240
hand

826
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:12,720
foot for foot burn for burn wound for

827
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,520
wound

828
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:16,240
bruise for bruise head pots for head

829
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:19,600
pads

830
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:22,080
welcome the cowgirl bible study neo

831
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:23,600
devotional gay sound zulu i feel very

832
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:26,880
spiritually aroused right now

833
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:29,360
my third eye chakra dripping macaroni in

834
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,360
a pot

835
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:34,240
i need jesus i'm so sorry so the law of

836
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:37,039
moses is pretty based and uncooked

837
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:38,159
it's basically an eye for an eye don't

838
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:40,880
be a homo

839
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:42,320
you know basic common sense but then

840
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:44,000
jesus comes along and he's

841
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:46,080
riding his high horse of love and

842
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:49,520
forgiveness in matthew 26

843
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:52,159
52 a disciple tries to defend jesus from

844
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:54,559
being arrested after judas betrays him

845
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:55,919
but jesus says put your sword back in

846
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:57,760
his place spartacus

847
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:59,600
all who draw the sword will die by the

848
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:01,440
sword now some people read that as

849
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,799
saying that violence begets violence and

850
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,159
should be renounced

851
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:06,480
even to the point where you shouldn't

852
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:07,279
defend yourself which is peak radical

853
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:09,279
centrism

854
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:11,120
denying the right of marginalized people

855
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:13,840
to defend themselves

856
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:14,640
rethink this it gets worse in the sermon

857
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:17,520
on the mount

858
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:19,200
jesus says love your enemies and pray

859
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:21,200
for those who persecute you

860
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,240
love your enemies but i don't want to

861
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:25,679
love my enemies

862
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:28,000
no loving smashing but maybe

863
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:29,919
jesus wasn't as literal minded as that

864
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,640
you know religion is a very subjective

865
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:33,760
thing and

866
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:36,640
i have my own bible interpretations and

867
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:37,200
my personal view is that a lot of what

868
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:40,559
jesus

869
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:43,600
says is actually sarcasm

870
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:46,159
like consider matthew 5 38 why is no one

871
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:48,159
talking about matthew 5 38 jesus says

872
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:50,399
you've heard that it was said an eye for

873
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:50,880
an eye and a tooth for a tooth but i say

874
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:53,120
to you

875
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:54,720
do not resist an evildoer but if anyone

876
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:58,000
strikes you in the right cheek

877
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:59,919
turn the other also think of the drama

878
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,080
of what he's asking you to do here

879
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:05,279
someone strikes you across the face

880
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:07,600
and you go ugh

881
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:08,399
this is not pacifism this is passive

882
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:11,279
aggression

883
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:13,200
some sort of primeval hebrew shade this

884
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:17,039
is the christianity of

885
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:19,440
okay well i'll pray for you

886
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:21,440
but if you do take jesus at face value

887
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:23,600
then i would argue that his endorsement

888
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:24,799
of love and forgiveness as a response to

889
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:27,600
wrongdoing

890
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:29,440
is not justice at all it's an

891
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:32,720
alternative to justice

892
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:35,360
in the absence of justice forgiveness

893
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:37,039
is an emotional unburdening of the

894
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:39,760
resentment and anger

895
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:42,159
the victims of injustice experience and

896
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:44,399
religion often provides this release

897
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:46,480
instructing people not to worry too much

898
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:48,880
about serving earthly justice

899
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:50,720
because justice is really god's business

900
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:52,000
and he'll take care of that when the day

901
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,840
of judgment comes

902
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,600
it's a little bit like in hinduism and

903
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:58,000
buddhism there's the idea of

904
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:59,760
karma which is like a cosmic law of

905
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,240
moral cause and effect

906
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:03,600
that exists independently of any god or

907
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:06,799
human institution

908
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:08,080
you reap what you sow basically so maybe

909
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:10,640
don't worry about injustice

910
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:12,559
too much because karma will take care of

911
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,960
it this kind of thinking is sometimes

912
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:15,279
called

913
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:17,600
the just world fallacy the cognitive

914
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:18,720
bias that sees the world as inherently

915
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,720
fair and good

916
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:22,480
everything happens for a reason if

917
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:25,200
something really horrible happens

918
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:27,200
like a child is murdered people say

919
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:29,520
there's a special place in god's kingdom

920
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:31,039
for little angels taken up so soon and

921
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:32,720
then they'll fantasize about the killer

922
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:34,720
going to hell and being

923
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:36,000
anally demolished by fire demons or

924
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:38,240
whatever people reassure

925
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,360
themselves like this because it relieves

926
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:42,240
the stress

927
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:43,840
of enduring unresolved injustice in the

928
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:46,320
bible the book of job

929
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:48,399
deals with the problem of injustice why

930
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:50,559
do bad things happen to good people

931
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:52,559
and the answer is just don't worry about

932
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:54,799
it it's it's part of god's plan

933
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:56,799
it'll all work out in the end it's fine

934
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:59,039
everything's fine the alternative

935
00:30:56,799 --> 00:31:01,600
is being burdened with the awareness

936
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:04,960
that the world is just kind of

937
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:07,360
very not good in which case you might

938
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:09,519
start getting ideas in your head about

939
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:11,440
i don't know maybe changing some things

940
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:13,200
i guess i should disclaimer that hashtag

941
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:15,200
not all religion and obviously many

942
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:16,000
political activists have been influenced

943
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:19,399
by faith

944
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:22,320
but let's put a pin in that for now 3.

945
00:31:19,399 --> 00:31:23,240
utilitarianism so there's also a secular

946
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:25,760
tradition of

947
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:26,240
anti-retribution thinking which tries to

948
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,320
define

949
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:29,440
justice as something other than

950
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:32,159
retaliation

951
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:34,000
utilitarian reformists have argued that

952
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:36,559
the goal of criminal justice

953
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,440
should be to improve society rather than

954
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:40,720
punishment for punishment's sake

955
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:42,480
utilitarianism is the moral theory which

956
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:44,799
says that the right thing to do

957
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:46,880
is whatever causes the highest ratio of

958
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:48,480
human happiness to human suffering

959
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:50,080
so the utilitarian approach to

960
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:52,080
punishment looks forward

961
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:54,320
at preventing future crimes where

962
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,720
retribution looks backward at punishing

963
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:57,600
past

964
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:59,919
crimes revenge by proxy some utilitarian

965
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:01,760
punishment goals might be deterrence

966
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:02,960
punishing criminals as an incentive for

967
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:05,440
others not to offend

968
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:06,080
or incapacitation of criminals in

969
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:08,559
prisons

970
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:10,240
or rehabilitation of criminals trying to

971
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:11,600
educate or discipline them so that they

972
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,799
can re-enter society

973
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:15,120
a lot of people consider these

974
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:17,279
utilitarian goals to be more rational

975
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:19,760
and scientific than retribution

976
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:22,720
which is very based in emotions also the

977
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:24,799
utilitarian idea of justice makes sense

978
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:26,559
even if you don't believe in free will

979
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:28,720
because retribution really only makes

980
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:30,000
sense if you believe that people freely

981
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,600
choose their actions

982
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,919
and are therefore culpable for their

983
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:36,159
behavior and can be deserving

984
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:37,840
of punishment because punishing someone

985
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:38,559
for something they didn't meaningfully

986
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:41,440
choose

987
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:43,519
seems well the greek historian herodotus

988
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:45,200
tells a story about the persian king's

989
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:47,679
xerxes ordering the sea

990
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:49,600
to be whipped with 300 lashes after a

991
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:52,080
storm destroyed his bridge

992
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:53,120
which seems irrational right to punish a

993
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:55,519
force of nature

994
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:57,840
leave my beautiful wet wife alone it's

995
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:59,919
debatable how free humans are

996
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:01,120
like we're at least partially products

997
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:03,600
of our genetics

998
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:04,880
our environment our upbringing our

999
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:07,120
hogwarts house

1000
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:09,760
the placement of venus in our natal

1001
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:11,840
chart dry oilier combination

1002
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:13,919
and modern criminal sentencing tries to

1003
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:15,600
take all of that into consideration like

1004
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:16,559
you might get a lighter sentence if you

1005
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:18,080
argue that

1006
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:20,000
you know your mother never took you to

1007
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:22,240
disneyland it was a crime of

1008
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,080
passion through no fault of my own i was

1009
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:25,600
high on bath salts at the time of the

1010
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:27,200
tax evasion your honor

1011
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:30,000
a lot of the language around punishment

1012
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:31,600
in our legal system is utilitarian like

1013
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,519
prisons are called correctional

1014
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:35,840
facilities and not

1015
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:37,600
retribution cages but correctional

1016
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:40,080
facilities is a euphemism

1017
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:42,000
because the fact is these facilities are

1018
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:43,919
not doing very much correcting

1019
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,840
i'm sorry in the united states

1020
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:47,600
two-thirds of released prisoners are

1021
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:51,120
re-arrested within three years

1022
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:52,799
and 76 are re-arrested within five years

1023
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:54,240
and just think about the way we talk

1024
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:56,159
about incarceration

1025
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:57,279
like if someone really evil gets a long

1026
00:33:56,159 --> 00:34:00,000
sentence we say

1027
00:33:57,279 --> 00:34:01,360
good i hope he rots in prison like when

1028
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,279
was the last time you heard about a

1029
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:05,600
criminal sentencing and someone said

1030
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:06,960
good the proven efficacy of our

1031
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:09,119
correctional facilities will

1032
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:11,280
rehabilitate this man and release him a

1033
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:13,040
contributing member of his community so

1034
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:14,800
even the institutions we have that are

1035
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:16,320
supposed to serve a correctional or

1036
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:18,800
rehabilitative function

1037
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:19,760
are still obviously satisfying our urge

1038
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,760
to punish

1039
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:23,359
i think the problem with utilitarianism

1040
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:26,960
is that while it's very

1041
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:27,839
rational it's often offensive to human

1042
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:29,359
emotions

1043
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:31,200
and you can say facts don't care about

1044
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:32,960
your feelings we shouldn't be basing our

1045
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:35,040
legal system on whatever sadistic

1046
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:36,720
caprice passes through your mind

1047
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:39,200
and i agree with you but the fact

1048
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:41,200
remains if someone hurts your child

1049
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:42,560
you don't want to rehabilitate him you

1050
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:44,560
want to set him on fire

1051
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:46,159
and this disconnect between the legal

1052
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:48,399
system and human emotion

1053
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:49,200
affects law enforcement too a youtuber

1054
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:51,359
called jose

1055
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:52,560
has a video called why some cops think

1056
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:54,639
they're the punisher

1057
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:56,079
which argues that some cops and soldiers

1058
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:57,599
admire the punisher

1059
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:59,760
because they relate to his military

1060
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:01,680
background while fantasizing

1061
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,800
about the moral simplicity of his

1062
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:04,480
vigilantism

1063
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:06,640
jose quotes from interviews with

1064
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:07,040
military punisher fans who say things

1065
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:09,359
like

1066
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:11,599
castle doesn't see shades of grey which

1067
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:13,599
unfortunately the american justice

1068
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:14,880
system is littered with and which tends

1069
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:16,800
to slow down and sometimes

1070
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:18,720
even hinder victims of crime from

1071
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:20,720
getting the justice they deserve

1072
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:22,720
frank castle is the ultimate definition

1073
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:24,960
of occam's razor for the military

1074
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:26,880
don't worry about uniforms inspections

1075
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:29,280
or restrictive rules of engagement

1076
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:30,560
find the bad guys kill the bad guys

1077
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:33,200
protect the innocent

1078
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:35,520
any true warrior that's the dream so

1079
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:37,760
these cops and soldiers feel cramped

1080
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:38,720
by rules of engagement and use of force

1081
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,800
restrictions

1082
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:42,079
that are keeping them from serving swift

1083
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:44,400
and brutal justice

1084
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:45,280
you know law enforcement would be a lot

1085
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:47,599
easier

1086
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:49,920
if it weren't for all these pesky laws

1087
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:52,880
there's a childish simplicity and

1088
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:53,760
dualism to this moral worldview find the

1089
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:56,240
bad guys

1090
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:58,320
kill the bad guys again it reminds me of

1091
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:59,920
the nra rhetoric about how you need a

1092
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:02,400
good guy with a gun

1093
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:04,079
to stop a bad guy with a gun they sound

1094
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:05,359
like eight-year-old boys playing cops

1095
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:09,359
and robbers

1096
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:09,359
good guys and bad guys

1097
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:13,119
that's my impression of an

1098
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:14,880
eight-year-old boy and to be fair i

1099
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:15,680
totally understand the appeal of moral

1100
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:17,760
simplicity

1101
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:19,599
people love justice served and instant

1102
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:23,280
karma videos for a reason

1103
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:25,599
we take satisfaction in swift decisive

1104
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:28,079
elegant retribution but the procedures

1105
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:29,760
of law enforcement and criminal justice

1106
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:31,200
don't allow for that there's all these

1107
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:33,280
tedious roadblocks

1108
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:35,119
right to an attorney right to remain

1109
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:37,599
silent right to a fair trial

1110
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:39,680
presumption of innocence a lot of police

1111
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:41,760
wish they could simplify things by being

1112
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:43,599
judge jury and executioner but the

1113
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:45,760
function of police is supposed to be

1114
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:47,440
limited to making arrests and initiating

1115
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:49,200
criminal investigations

1116
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:50,480
they're not supposed to be walking

1117
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:52,640
avatars of karma

1118
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:53,760
dispensing free-form retribution in the

1119
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:56,400
streets at will

1120
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:58,640
justice served now with 20 more police

1121
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:00,480
brutality but a lot of people defend

1122
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:02,720
the police when they behave like this

1123
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:05,040
because the thin wristed civilians

1124
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:06,960
are just as emotionally frustrated by

1125
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:08,400
due process as the cops

1126
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:11,359
well did i just say all lives are

1127
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:13,359
bastards i'm double cancelled well look

1128
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:15,119
all lives are bastards but only some

1129
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:17,119
bastards are armed by the state and

1130
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:19,599
licensed to go bastarding around

1131
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:21,520
town the rest of us have to be bastards

1132
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:22,000
on our off time i also think there's a

1133
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:24,160
secular

1134
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,240
version of the just world fallacy going

1135
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:27,760
on here people like to think that if the

1136
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:29,599
police kill somebody

1137
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:31,680
it must be because that person did

1138
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:34,480
something wrong karma at work

1139
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:36,720
just as served victim blaming is an

1140
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:39,440
expression of the just world fallacy

1141
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:40,720
you get what you deserve so if something

1142
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:42,560
bad happens to you

1143
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:44,560
you must have been asking for it and

1144
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:45,359
obviously racism is a huge part of this

1145
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:47,599
you know there's

1146
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:49,200
structural white supremacy that occupies

1147
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:51,200
black neighborhoods with police instead

1148
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:52,960
of investing in communities and people

1149
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:54,800
are prejudiced and more likely to think

1150
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:56,880
of black people as criminal thugs and

1151
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:59,040
therefore deserving of police violence

1152
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:00,880
so we get this no angel discourse that

1153
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:02,000
comes up every time a black person is

1154
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:03,359
murdered by the police

1155
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,119
where they bring up the victim's

1156
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:07,040
criminal record or a picture of them

1157
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:08,800
looking like a scary thug as if that

1158
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:11,040
proves they deserved to die

1159
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,920
the problem with this of course is that

1160
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:14,640
no one

1161
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:15,359
is an angel there are no angels walking

1162
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:17,839
this earth

1163
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:19,440
we're all flawed we've all made mistakes

1164
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:21,760
we've all done bad things that doesn't

1165
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:23,200
mean we deserve to die of violent death

1166
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:25,359
and then there's people like brianna

1167
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:27,280
taylor and elijah mclean who as far as

1168
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:28,320
we know were about as close to angels as

1169
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:30,480
humans come

1170
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:31,359
but that didn't protect them so that is

1171
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:33,280
100

1172
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:35,119
beside the point because black people in

1173
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:36,880
america should not literally have to

1174
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:39,040
have white feather wings and glowing

1175
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:39,760
halos to deserve not to be murdered by

1176
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:41,440
the police

1177
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:43,280
in fact people of all races have the

1178
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:44,800
absolute right to be low-life

1179
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:46,960
drug-addicted petty criminals who

1180
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:47,920
contribute absolutely nothing to society

1181
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,839
and yet still

1182
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:51,119
not be executed by the cops because

1183
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:53,760
that's what it's supposed to mean

1184
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:55,599
to live in a free country so things need

1185
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,079
to change the punisher police have got

1186
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:57,520
to go

1187
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:59,359
and a lot of the rest of our justice

1188
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:01,119
system with them we need to imagine a

1189
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:03,599
whole new approach to justice

1190
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:04,880
and to be honest that might take more

1191
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:06,079
than one youtube video

1192
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:07,920
i know at the beginning i said i was

1193
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:13,200
going to explain what justice is but

1194
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:13,200
um i lied

1195
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:16,480
i'm sorry that i can't fix america i'm

1196
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:19,760
just a lonely cat

1197
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:21,280
i guess the only solution is revolution

1198
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:22,880
and by revolution i do mean vote

1199
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:24,720
democrat and then bully the democrats

1200
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:28,330
into actually doing something

1201
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:31,040
and if they don't listen
