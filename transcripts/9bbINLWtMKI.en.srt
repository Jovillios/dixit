want my gender to be tolerated in the

84
00:04:10,519 --> 00:04:14,120
way that liberal Christians tolerate

85
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:16,090

so look Shapiro Benny baby I invite you

93
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:34,460
to disenchant all of my fairy tales to

94
00:04:32,419 --> 00:04:37,010
melt away every crystal of my snowflake

95
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:40,220
eree and henceforth dispense only there

96
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:41,960
was scalding tea all right big boy let's

97
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:43,400
have it I'm willing to call Caitlyn

98
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:45,290
Jenner Caitlyn Jenner I'm not willing to

99
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:46,520
call Caitlyn Jenner is she because you

100
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:48,650
can't change your sexting change right

101
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:51,080
Caitlyn Jenner is a man a biological man

102
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:52,460
and if he were born with high doses of

103
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:54,260
estrogen in his bloodstream he would

104
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:55,639
also not be a woman or that you were

105
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:57,410
determined by your chromosomes said the

106
00:04:55,639 --> 00:05:00,380
argument is that what it means to be a

107
00:04:57,410 --> 00:05:03,020
she is to have a normal female karyotype

108
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:04,970
that is exact sex chromosomes and if you

109
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:07,700
don't have that karyotype then you're

110
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:09,620
not a she and to call you she would be

111
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:11,690
tantamount to a lie but I was just

112
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:14,180
wondering what you see the detriment of

113
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:16,550
society like why we can't like let a

114
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:18,680
transgender like woman be called she or

115
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:20,539
something because it is a lie so since

116
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:22,520
you think that calling a trans woman she

117
00:05:20,539 --> 00:05:24,860
is a lie and you think that what it

118
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:27,380
means to be a she is to have a normal

119
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:29,960
female karyotype then you must think

120
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:31,460
that when we call trans woman she we are

121
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:34,460
saying that she has a normal female

122
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:36,740
karyotype but hold on I am a transgender

123
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:39,289
woman and I have never claims to have a

124
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:41,450
normal female karyotype yet my friends

125
00:05:39,289 --> 00:05:45,020
lovers and most strangers call me she

126
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:46,240
her Miss ma'am girlfriend ladies good

127
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:48,790
girl

128
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:51,730
just like that don't stop don't stop are

129
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:54,190
all of us deluded about my biology now

130
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:55,060
it is not I who misunderstands biology

131
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:57,190
Ben Shapiro

132
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:59,110
it is you who misunderstands language

133
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:01,540
you have deceptively framed the debate

134
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:04,030
as a debate about biology which it is

135
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:06,250
not we all agree on the biology the

136
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:09,430
actual subject of the debate is the

137
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:11,530
proper use of words such as he/she man

138
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:14,050
and woman but how do we decide on the

139
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:15,810
correct way to use a word well there are

140
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:18,640
two kinds of arguments we could make

141
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:20,530
descriptive or prescriptive if we take

142
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:22,810
the descriptive approach then what we

143
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:25,450
must do is act like anthropologists and

144
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:27,910
study the way a word for instance she is

145
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:29,470
used by a linguistic community and

146
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:31,150
whatever the social convention is is

147
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:33,310
what's correct but if we take the

148
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:34,660
prescriptive approach that we must make

149
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:36,760
an argument about the way the word is

150
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:38,710
she should be used

151
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:39,850
meaning we either defer to an authority

152
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:41,740
such as the dictionary

153
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:43,540
well my ruler on your wrists you naughty

154
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:45,400
boy or we must have some goal that we

155
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:47,500
want to accomplish by approving some

156
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:49,360
uses of the word and prohibiting others

157
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:51,820
now if we take the descriptive approach

158
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,620
you lose ben shapiro because most people

159
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:56,350
call me she and that's all there is to

160
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:59,320
it what's more your usage of Oishi and

161
00:06:56,350 --> 00:07:01,300
aji is ungrammatical you don't put an

162
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:03,100
article before pronoun that's not how

163
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:05,260
pronouns work you silly dumbed down also

164
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:07,810
human sex chromosomes were discovered in

165
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:09,400
1905 while the English pronouns he and

166
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:11,320
she originated in the proto-germanic

167
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:13,090
language spoken during the pre-roman

168
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:14,620
Iron Age of Northern Europe beginning

169
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:17,110
around 500 BCE

170
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:18,640
therefore by insisting that the singular

171
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:19,960
third-person pronouns of the English

172
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:23,200
language refers specifically to

173
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:25,090
karyotype it is you and not I who is

174
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:28,060
breaking from linguistic tradition ben

175
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:30,400
shapiro however as a trans woman it's

176
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:32,650
not generally in my interest to defer to

177
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,660
traditions so let's try out a

178
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:36,100
prescriptive approach without simply

179
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:39,310
appealing to the way a word is already

180
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:40,540
used how do we decide how a word should

181
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:43,000
be

182
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:44,980
language is by nature ambiguous and the

183
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,410
way we attempt to disambiguate it is

184
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:49,090
often motivated by political goals then

185
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:51,100
shapiro thinks we should not call

186
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:53,470
transwomen she because his political

187
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:56,170
goal is to reinforce rigid conservative

188
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:58,300
gender roles whereas I think we should

189
00:07:56,170 --> 00:08:00,430
call trans women she because my

190
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:02,410
political goal is to live in a society

191
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:04,360
where I can achieve the same level of

192
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:06,190
sadness and dysfunction as everyone else

193
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:08,320
is analogous to the debate about

194
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:10,210
same-sex marriage from a decade ago

195
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:12,190
opponents argue the dictionary and legal

196
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:14,620
definition of marriage was union between

197
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:17,440
a man and a woman and the definition

198
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:20,020
shouldn't be changed because it's the

199
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,640
definition and how am I supposed to

200
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:23,440
explain to my child and on the other

201
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:25,180
hand gay people argue that the

202
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:27,010
definition should be changed because

203
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:28,630
they want it to achieve the same level

204
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:31,030
of sadness and dysfunction as everyone

205
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:33,430
else and they succeeded because as it

206
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:34,900
turns out you can in fact change the

207
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:36,880
definitions of words

208
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:38,920
the dictionary is simply a usage guide

209
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,720
it's not the Bible and for that matter

210
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:42,670
you can change the Bible I mean have you

211
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:45,520
read the contemporary English version

212
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:46,120
the prose is atrocious appalling I won't

213
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,920
stand for this

214
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:50,110
but unlike the debate about gay marriage

215
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,550
the question of our trans womanhood is

216
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:53,350
more than just a political and legal

217
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:55,510
dispute it seems to me that whatever

218
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:57,640
church state and merriam-webster decide

219
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:59,830
trans women already are and will

220
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:01,780
continue to be women and to see why I

221
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:04,300
want to elaborate on an argument posed

222
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:07,330
to ben shapiro by my sometime rival

223
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:10,060
blair white yes even though she's one of

224
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:12,010
the youtubers boost is bad the debate

225
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:14,260
begins with ben shapiro asserting his

226
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:16,360
usual position that pronouns are used to

227
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:18,400
designate so-called biological men and

228
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:20,110
biological women blair responds by

229
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,880
observing that ben's a way of using

230
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:24,040
pronouns is in her case completely

231
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:26,530
impractical well if you and i were to go

232
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:27,700
to a business dinner or any kind in ER

233
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:29,470
and you were meeting me at a restaurant

234
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:32,140
and i was there first and I was in an

235
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:33,940
orange shirt and you had to tell you

236
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:36,010
know the host I'm here to meet my friend

237
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:38,680
Blair and they said okay and you had to

238
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:40,120
describe me to take me to the table you

239
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:41,200
wouldn't say the man in the orange shirt

240
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,550
you would say Blair and you would say

241
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,680
her

242
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:44,910
over there Ben then responds saying I

243
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,920
think there's some truth to that meaning

244
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:48,720
that I think that there is a utility to

245
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:50,160
the use of pronouns but that's not quite

246
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,470
the same as suggesting that a

247
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:54,240
transgender woman is a she in the

248
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:56,040
objective sense and Blair responds to

249
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,899
that with what I think is a very good

250
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:59,610
analogy for instance if someone were to

251
00:09:57,899 --> 00:10:02,220
adopt children there's no biological

252
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:03,540
basis for calling them that kids parent

253
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:04,950
right because they're not like they're

254
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:07,529
just literally not there's no link at

255
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:08,850
all biologically but there is a social

256
00:10:07,529 --> 00:10:10,170
reason to do it and there's a legal

257
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:12,120
reason to do it let's expand on that

258
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:13,649
analogy suppose you're an adoptive

259
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:15,779
parent and you're arguing with someone

260
00:10:13,649 --> 00:10:17,579
who says your adopted child isn't really

261
00:10:15,779 --> 00:10:19,560
your child and you aren't really a

262
00:10:17,579 --> 00:10:21,779
parent as evidence they point to the

263
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:24,510
dictionary definition of parent one that

264
00:10:21,779 --> 00:10:26,370
begets or brings forth offspring you did

265
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:28,740
not B get a ring fourth offspring they

266
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:31,019
argue therefore you are not a parent

267
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:32,459
facts don't care about your feelings no

268
00:10:31,019 --> 00:10:34,140
matter how much you love and care for

269
00:10:32,459 --> 00:10:36,540
this child you'll never be anything but

270
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:37,860
a glorified kidnapper I think it's clear

271
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:40,910
that the person who makes this argument

272
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:43,920
is being uncivil yes being provocative

273
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:46,339
controversial politically incorrect but

274
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:49,470
they're not just impolite they're also

275
00:10:46,339 --> 00:10:52,050
wrong because an adoptive parent is

276
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:54,570
socially and functionally just as real a

277
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:57,930
parent as a biological parent and to say

278
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:59,520
otherwise is not just rude it's false so

279
00:10:57,930 --> 00:11:01,290
what do you have to say to that Ben

280
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:02,520
Shapiro I wouldn't say that we actually

281
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:04,170
do have different descriptions for

282
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:05,730
adoptive parents than biological parents

283
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:06,930
right you'll say in shorthand that their

284
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:09,060
parents because they're all different

285
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:11,610
types of parents but we do say adoptive

286
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:14,160
parents right adoptive parents an

287
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:16,950
entirely valid type of parent to call

288
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:19,110
them parents is not a lie and then the

289
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:21,180
question becomes okay exactly is the

290
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:23,310
context that you were suggesting matters

291
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:24,480
in what context are we talking about the

292
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:26,040
parents are we talking about a PTA

293
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,020
meeting okay this person is the legal

294
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:29,970
guardian and therefore the parent

295
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:31,470
because parenting has two aspects right

296
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:33,029
there's the biological parentage and

297
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:35,610
then there is the actual role of

298
00:11:33,029 --> 00:11:36,779
parenting so yes there are some contexts

299
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:38,790
where we do need to distinguish between

300
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:40,680
biological and adoptive parents for

301
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:42,570
instance if a doctor is assessing a

302
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:44,699
child's risk of some hereditary disease

303
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:46,890
they need to know if the parents are

304
00:11:44,699 --> 00:11:48,700
adoptive or biological but at the PTA

305
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:50,380
meeting and in most other contacts

306
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:52,060
it doesn't matter in the slightest in

307
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:53,740
the in the dinner conversation the same

308
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:55,270
thing sort of holds true meaning there's

309
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:57,190
the biological role of woman which

310
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:58,630
you're not and then there is the you

311
00:11:57,190 --> 00:12:00,070
look like a woman which is I'm gonna

312
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:01,390
describe the you as a woman to the

313
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:02,920
waiter when he comes to the recomme to

314
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:05,020
the table just one Bend seems on the

315
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:06,460
cusp of having a breakthrough he and

316
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:08,470
Blair pause their argument to

317
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:10,210
congratulate themselves and how civil

318
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:12,820
their discussion is from what I've seen

319
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:15,490
a lot of your interactions with trans

320
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:16,870
people I always end up kind of ugly you

321
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:18,520
know what I mean there was the I think I

322
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:20,020
think the person's name was Zoe turn

323
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:22,930
there was the threat of physical

324
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:24,750
violence your genetics you cut that out

325
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:26,770
now or you'll go home in an ambulance

326
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:28,750
yeah I mean what's hilarious about this

327
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:30,250
Blair is literally the exact same thing

328
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:32,770
that I'm saying to you right now is

329
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:34,810
exactly what I said to Zoe to her on the

330
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:35,290
air but that's not exactly true is it

331
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:37,300
Ben

332
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:40,150
Zoe threatened you after you called her

333
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:42,280
sir and he didn't call Blair sir did you

334
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:44,440
why did you call Zoe sir

335
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:46,990
what kind of reaction were you hoping to

336
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:48,880
elicit ODIs ting guaa stroy er of

337
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:51,600
snowflakes I suppose you were just

338
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:54,430
sticking to the facts I suppose sir is a

339
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:56,560
strictly biological term Queen Guinevere

340
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:59,470
said in days of old I Knight thee

341
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:01,270
Lancelot thou the dart carrier typically

342
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:02,680
male and you're exactly right when

343
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:05,260
people start yelling at each other or

344
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:06,550
tweeting out fu that's not a great way

345
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:08,770
to change my mind it turns out that's

346
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:10,360
not particularly convincing so what is a

347
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:10,870
great way to change your mind Ben

348
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,790
Shapiro

349
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:15,340
did Blair budge you an inch with her

350
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:18,130
rationality her even temper her civility

351
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:20,020
her aesthetic it doesn't seem like she

352
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:21,600
did at the end of this to be you

353
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:23,890
regurgitate your original position

354
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,570
undigested you know I'm the editor of a

355
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:27,190
pretty major site and my basic rule is

356
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:28,420
that when we were discussing people are

357
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:29,830
trans we immediately say in the first

358
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:31,690
paragraph trans woman and then refers

359
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:33,640
them by their biological pronoun because

360
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:35,800
biology is the nature of the pronoun

361
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:37,960
biology is the nature of the pronouns

362
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:39,850
didn't Blair just demonstrate to you

363
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:42,070
that in most contexts that's not true

364
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:44,350
for her remember the analogy of adoptive

365
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:46,000
parents there were some contexts where

366
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:48,600
it makes sense to distinguish between

367
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,610
adoptive parents and biological parents

368
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:52,680
likewise there are some scientific and

369
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:54,480
medical contexts where it makes sense to

370
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:57,630
distinguish between transgender and

371
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:59,610
cisgender or as you say biological women

372
00:13:57,630 --> 00:14:01,440
for instance when discussing who needs

373
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:03,270
access to certain reproductive health

374
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,790
care you think should be illegal but

375
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:08,430
does this apply to pronouns that is are

376
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:09,510
pronouns technical biological terms to

377
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:11,490
noting karyotypes

378
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:13,020
or are they part of the everyday

379
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:15,930
language we use to describe each other

380
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:18,540
socially the answer is obvious there are

381
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:20,580
no geneticists studying pronouns in fact

382
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:22,110
there's not a single biology textbook

383
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:25,730
with a chapter on the difference between

384
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:28,260
a he and a she there is no such thing as

385
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:30,450
biological pronouns this is a phrase

386
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:32,820
invented in the last decade to describe

387
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:35,160
the misgendering of trans people so as a

388
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:38,070
trans woman i'm reintegrating myself

389
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:39,750
into society as a woman she pronouns are

390
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:42,210
therefore most appropriate for me

391
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:44,820
regardless of my Anatomy which is none

392
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:47,130
of your business ben shapiro fascinating

393
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:48,960
though it is and just as is encouraged

394
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:51,630
to tell an adoptive mother that her son

395
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:54,210
is not her child to call me he is not

396
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:57,420
just rude or insensitive it is in effect

397
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:59,460
false but it is also rude and

398
00:14:57,420 --> 00:15:02,220
insensitive so even if you don't agree

399
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:04,350
with me you could still not what's the

400
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:06,660
harm right I teach my almost 4 year old

401
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:07,890
girl that she can become a boy then I

402
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:08,880
think that is not only lying to her I

403
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:11,160
think it's confusing her and I think

404
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:13,470
it's damaging to her psyche oh yes the

405
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:15,750
classic argument how do I explain to my

406
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:18,120
child to kill your shitty childhood role

407
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:19,800
I care that's simply not my problem I

408
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:21,570
regret every night I spent with you Ben

409
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:23,670
Shapiro I met a new relationship now

410
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:26,400
with the lesbian you and I are through

411
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:28,940
I'm getting an abortion and you can't

412
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,940
stop me

413
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:38,300
it's disgusting what they allow on TV

414
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:40,610
these days I won't allow my children to

415
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:43,760
watch movies unless there's at least a

416
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:45,740
bloodbath or maybe an orgy but hey I

417
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:47,720
don't choose this schlock I just

418
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:49,460
presented the second program of

419
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:52,130
tonight's science fiction double feature

420
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:54,770
is about a cult of chaos hell-bent on

421
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:56,480
destroying Western civilization I sure

422
00:15:54,770 --> 00:16:05,330
hope there's more sex and violence this

423
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:07,580
time it's points again same queen new

424
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:09,890
look try to keep up in my previous video

425
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:11,660
nasty tea babe likes it rough I made an

426
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:13,820
argument about why it's correct to go

427
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:15,290
trans women she but I'd be bullshitting

428
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:17,570
you if I only discussed fully-integrated

429
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:19,460
binary trans people everyone basically

430
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:21,770
calls them by their pronouns already

431
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:23,600
dingbats like ben shapiro have to exert

432
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:25,700
conscious effort to continue the charade

433
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,440
of misgendering though the transgender

434
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:29,090
woman from orange is the new black i

435
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,200
never watch that i've never watched that

436
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:32,240
show either but she's not a comfort Time

437
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:36,440
magazine oh or he's on the cover of Time

438
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:38,600
magazine I limited my argument to trans

439
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:40,790
women who look the way society expects a

440
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:42,800
woman to look because it says people

441
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:44,480
have an easier time making sense of that

442
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:47,060
but the reality is that in a lot of

443
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:49,130
cases it's a little more complicated now

444
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:52,010
as far as early transition trans people

445
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:54,140
go I am fairly integrated Society

446
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:56,270
basically gets that I'm a woman without

447
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:59,030
me having to explain my gender strangers

448
00:16:56,270 --> 00:17:01,100
usually default to she/her miss ma'am

449
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:03,710
hey haven't I seen your videos on t girl

450
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:06,710
love.com but the truth is I don't pass

451
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:08,870
perfectly I got cold sir last week by

452
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:11,420
the cashier in H&M not that I usually

453
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:13,520
deign to shop at H&M but needless to say

454
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:15,740
it was a desperate emergency and by

455
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:17,720
emergency I mean I met a cute busboy at

456
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:19,310
PF Changs and what happened next stays

457
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:21,590
between me and the Lord but suffice to

458
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:25,520
say that my blouse was irrevocably

459
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:26,500
drenched in okay i embellished the story

460
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:29,330
a little

461
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:31,550
so between being 6 foot 1 the horrific

462
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:33,800
transsexuals squawking I try to pass off

463
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:35,600
as my voice and my tragic inability to

464
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:37,640
conduct myself in a manner befitting a

465
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,240
lady of good breeding your girl remains

466
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,950
just

467
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:43,270
my desperate painstaking efforts

468
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:45,500
somewhat claw Keable you look great hon

469
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:47,750
and that debate between Ben and Blair

470
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:49,790
Blair says that pronoun usage boils down

471
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:51,830
to what you look like but it really does

472
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:53,690
kind of boil down to what you look like

473
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:55,490
and it's true that most strangers will

474
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:56,600
choose a pronoun for you largely based

475
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:58,580
on your appearance

476
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:00,260
so appearance definitely matters but in

477
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:02,540
my opinion passing in the sense of

478
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:04,190
looking like a sis woman is really the

479
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:06,320
most important thing what matters more

480
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:09,110
to me is the kind of vibe you give them

481
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:11,150
the way you speak the gestures the

482
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:12,470
conversation will dynamic that kind of

483
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:15,200
stuff to me is what makes a person

484
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:17,630
viscerally seem like a man or a woman so

485
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:20,390
my goal isn't necessarily to serve

486
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:22,790
unlockable fish so much as to embody a

487
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:25,370
certain kind of diaphanous archetypal

488
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:27,230
femininity in layman's terms girl dick

489
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:29,600
energy also I am gonna have a lot of

490
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:31,250
plastic surgery thank God last month I

491
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:33,350
released a video called sexy furry

492
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:35,150
pounded by skinny T babe and a lot of

493
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:37,220
trans people got mad at me because they

494
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:38,510
thought I was saying that performing

495
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:40,429
your gender is the only thing that

496
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:42,020
matters and that how you identify counts

497
00:18:40,429 --> 00:18:44,780
for nothing but that's not what I think

498
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:46,610
I do prefer to argue that trans women

499
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:48,410
are women because we live the lives of

500
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:50,510
women because I think that's a much more

501
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:52,460
compelling argument than I'm a woman

502
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:54,530
because I psychologically identify as a

503
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:56,090
woman which and my experience doesn't

504
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:57,860
really persuade anyone it's just too

505
00:18:56,090 --> 00:18:59,750
easy to poke holes in them but identity

506
00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:01,400
definitely does matter especially when

507
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:03,650
it comes to pronouns it'll explain why

508
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:05,960
now first I should acknowledge that a

509
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:08,360
lot of sis people are very sensitive

510
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:11,120
about anyone telling them what pronouns

511
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:13,160
to use so I'm gonna try to be respectful

512
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:15,200
of your feelings and what a difficult

513
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:16,910
impersonal issue this must be for you

514
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,890
after all we live in a repressive

515
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:21,500
political era despite the best efforts

516
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:23,929
of hero professor Jordan B Peterson but

517
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:26,270
alas he was too late now we hope you'll

518
00:19:23,929 --> 00:19:27,980
see a 16 which compels speech and sense

519
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:30,590
people to jail for oh it's been more

520
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:32,780
than a year since bill C 16 passed let's

521
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:35,170
check in on how many people have gone to

522
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:38,759
jail for pronoun misuse

523
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:38,759
[Music]

524
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:54,060
guess that was a false alarm ah damn it

525
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:56,340
look I'm not gonna tell you what

526
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:58,290
pronouns you have to use I'm just gonna

527
00:19:56,340 --> 00:20:00,120
tell you how I use pronouns am i

528
00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:02,640
reasoning behind it and you are welcome

529
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:04,680
to use your free speech to choose how

530
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:08,310
much of an obstinate Hobgoblin you want

531
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:10,800
to be okay so back to identity if I were

532
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:13,590
a cashier at the Emporium of ethereal

533
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:15,780
trinkets and a customer were to walk in

534
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:18,390
looking like this I might ordinarily

535
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:20,760
default to female pronouns but that

536
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:23,790
would be wrong since I happen to know

537
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:26,880
this person is not only a man he is the

538
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:29,460
man YouTube's most regal makeup artist

539
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:32,250
his lordship John McClane and he uses

540
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:34,440
he/him pronouns likewise if I were

541
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:36,330
approached by this person I had fall in

542
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:38,970
love and then default to female pronouns

543
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:40,800
and this time I'd be correct but not

544
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:42,930
because she's assist woman or a trans

545
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:45,090
woman but because she's gender fluid

546
00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:46,830
drag queen Courtney out who is a [ __ ]

547
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:49,260
audacity to be a more beautiful woman

548
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:51,420
than I am and who so far as I know uses

549
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:53,070
male pronouns and blend mode and female

550
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:55,020
pronouns and girl mode has two most

551
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:57,000
Queens a lot of the complexities of

552
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:59,610
gender language identity and expression

553
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,950
get played out in the world of drag some

554
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:04,080
queens like RuPaul just identify assist

555
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:06,810
man who live as men and perform as women

556
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:09,170
others like Courtney Sasha velour jinkx

557
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:12,150
monsoon shake cool eh and violet chachki

558
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:14,520
identify as non-binary others still are

559
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:16,890
bio queens sis women who perform as drag

560
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:18,660
queens like Lucy Garland or creme fatale

561
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:20,970
and then there are trans women who are

562
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:23,970
also dry Queens like peppermint imp

563
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:25,380
Queen or for that matter me I mean look

564
00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:27,120
at me do you think I dress like this

565
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:29,780
when I go to 7-eleven at 2:00 a.m.

566
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:32,580
because I do look what I have become a

567
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:33,960
bisexual transexual drag queen look I

568
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:35,700
didn't intend to become this much of a

569
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:37,440
snowflake I just through pure

570
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:39,030
coincidence happen to be the most

571
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:41,370
interesting and unique person who ever

572
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:42,960
lived I am so sorry I can't how bad so

573
00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:44,730
let's recap there are gender

574
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,620
non-conforming men who present a very

575
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:48,030
fun but use male pronouns your

576
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:50,310
assessment who use female pronouns

577
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:51,990
whenever they present female there were

578
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:53,280
gender-fluid people who use different

579
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:55,290
pronouns depending on their current

580
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:57,330
presentation there are free transition

581
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:58,920
trans people who identify as a gender

582
00:21:57,330 --> 00:22:01,170
other than the one they present and live

583
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:02,010
as and prefer other pronouns so you

584
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:04,050
really can't

585
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:05,550
rely on the way a person looks because

586
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:06,960
there's a lot of situations where the

587
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:09,810
way they look doesn't tell you the whole

588
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:12,180
story so as you can see identity

589
00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:14,340
definitely is important but it's also

590
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:16,110
not the only thing that matters a

591
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:17,940
psychological identity were the only

592
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:19,890
thing that mattered and there would be

593
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:22,230
no need for a trans person to come out

594
00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:24,000
or do anything to transition including

595
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:26,160
requesting different pronouns because

596
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,560
pronouns belong to the social world of

597
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:31,320
language not to individual psychology

598
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:33,180
this is an idea I tried to explore in my

599
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:35,850
sexy furry video you can identify

600
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:38,640
however you like but gender is also

601
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:40,710
social structural in interpersonal so if

602
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:43,380
for example you're a trans woman still

603
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:46,170
living as a man then you are fully trans

604
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:47,880
your identity is fully valid but until

605
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:50,100
you begin living as a woman your

606
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:52,650
womanhood remains kind of hypothetical

607
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:54,690
and when I say living as a woman I don't

608
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:57,150
mean passing there's too much emphasis

609
00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:59,190
on physical appearance and not enough on

610
00:22:57,150 --> 00:23:00,630
social relationships you know you don't

611
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:02,760
become a woman the first time you put on

612
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:04,650
a dress you become a woman the first

613
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:06,330
time an older female relative turns to

614
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:08,160
at a restaurant and says maybe you

615
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:09,600
should order the salad sweetie my point

616
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:11,760
is not to invalidate anyone's identity

617
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:13,740
as far as I'm concerned if a trans

618
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,960
person hasn't transitioned yet they are

619
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:17,850
fully trans I'm just trying to be

620
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:19,860
realistic about the fact that a lot of

621
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:21,810
people's gendered experience isn't

622
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:24,060
entirely a product of how they identify

623
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:25,770
but it this way I will always use female

624
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:27,930
pronouns for a trans woman but my

625
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:30,540
thought process behind it isn't always

626
00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:32,730
the same many trans women just seem like

627
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:35,040
women to me and literally the same way

628
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:36,750
that sis women seem like women and I use

629
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:38,400
female pronouns for them effortlessly

630
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:40,830
just as I was trained to do from birth

631
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:43,260
this I think is the goal for most binary

632
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:45,960
trans people we want not necessarily to

633
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:47,940
pass perfectly but at least to seem like

634
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:50,130
our genders to the people around us as

635
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:52,260
Laura Jane grace put it you want them to

636
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:53,970
see you like they see every other girl I

637
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:56,580
want people calling me she not out of

638
00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:59,160
politeness or respect for my identity as

639
00:23:56,580 --> 00:24:00,840
a trans a la man but just because I seem

640
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:04,830
like a woman to them because the reality

641
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:07,020
is not all trans women seem like a woman

642
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:08,880
to me in that visceral way and I live

643
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:10,680
with this constant crushing anxiety

644
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:12,480
though I don't seem like a woman to

645
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:14,460
other people I'm terrified of looking

646
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,280
like a third-rate drag queen and I cope

647
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:17,170
with that fear

648
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:19,330
by looking like a second-rate drag queen

649
00:24:17,170 --> 00:24:22,270
but look even if a person is giving my

650
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:24,610
eyes and ears a 0% woman if she tells me

651
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:26,650
you the trans woman I'm gonna use female

652
00:24:24,610 --> 00:24:29,440
pronouns no matter what she looks not

653
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:31,120
just to be polite but also because I

654
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:33,070
want to recognize the reality of her

655
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:35,620
psychological experience and especially

656
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:37,420
because I want to help her resocialize

657
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:40,270
and reintegrate into the world as her

658
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:42,460
true gender and of course sis people you

659
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:45,700
legally have the freedom to refuse to do

660
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:47,920
that but if he refuse you are being a

661
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:50,260
[ __ ] Gibbon and I would prefer that you

662
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:52,030
not be a [ __ ] Gibbon now we need to

663
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:52,480
address the gender queer elephant in the

664
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:54,280
room

665
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:56,410
an increasing number of people identify

666
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:58,690
not as male or female but as non-binary

667
00:24:56,410 --> 00:25:00,580
an umbrella term encompassing a bunch of

668
00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:03,070
more specific labels such as gender

669
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:04,000
queer gender fluid a gender grey gender

670
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:05,560
and so on

671
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,530
many of these people use a non-binary

672
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:09,760
pronoun in English usually they now if

673
00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:11,590
your verse impulse is to argue that

674
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:14,140
singular dazon grammatical nonsense

675
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:15,850
consider that having gendered singular

676
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:17,590
third-person pronouns at all is a

677
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:19,780
particular feature of the English

678
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:22,090
language as by no means shared by all

679
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:24,040
other languages including Turkish Korean

680
00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:25,210
Finnish which don't have them at all

681
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:26,770
language is just a bunch of [ __ ]

682
00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:28,720
sounds coming out of your mouth the

683
00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:30,580
human's makeup to suit our purposes if

684
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:32,500
your new teasing singular day it is a

685
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:34,630
little confusing at first but with some

686
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:37,240
practice it gets pretty easy they poured

687
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:39,250
milk on me I poured milk on them they

688
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:40,780
didn't themself in their milk and it was

689
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:42,580
good thus saith the Lord

690
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:45,040
so the blight thing to do here is easy

691
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:47,620
if someone asks you to call them Fae you

692
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:49,180
call them they but if you're like me you

693
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:50,740
don't want to just do a thing because

694
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:52,840
you'd automatically believe it's the

695
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:55,090
woke thing to do you want to understand

696
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:57,670
why you're doing it I don't just want to

697
00:25:55,090 --> 00:25:58,630
tolerate non-binary people I want to be

698
00:25:57,670 --> 00:26:00,460
a convert

699
00:25:58,630 --> 00:26:02,260
I want to believe about them well they

700
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:04,210
believe about themselves so long as

701
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:05,830
those beliefs are reasonable so what do

702
00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:07,990
all these words mean what are these

703
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:09,700
people talking about remember earlier we

704
00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:11,890
distinguish gender expression from

705
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:13,480
gender identity John McClane is feminine

706
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:15,730
in expression but a man

707
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:18,100
identity whereas I am a woman in

708
00:26:15,730 --> 00:26:20,559
identity in an expression I am a mess

709
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:22,630
let us meditate upon the lesbian

710
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:25,299
cultures great contributions to humanity

711
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:27,850
are science spirituality sexuality

712
00:26:25,299 --> 00:26:29,830
metaphysics the foot scale the foot

713
00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:32,799
scale is a diagram that looks like this

714
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:34,809
and quantifies from 1 to 10 over - to

715
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:37,179
stone butch the gender expression of a

716
00:26:34,809 --> 00:26:39,130
given domain such as moulin looks or

717
00:26:37,179 --> 00:26:41,830
Steven universe characters it can also

718
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:44,440
be used more abstractly for weapons fish

719
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:46,150
Pokemon or wind instruments maybe wood

720
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:47,290
non-binary people are trying to do with

721
00:26:46,150 --> 00:26:49,780
words like genderqueer

722
00:26:47,290 --> 00:26:51,669
a gender grey gender and so on is to

723
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:53,950
give to identity the same kind of

724
00:26:51,669 --> 00:26:56,200
specificity the foot scale gives to

725
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:58,030
expression but my input on this isn't

726
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:59,950
really worth that much because I'm not

727
00:26:58,030 --> 00:27:01,929
non-binary and it tell you the truth I

728
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:04,360
kind of feel for sis people here because

729
00:27:01,929 --> 00:27:06,970
all of us talk about gender identity a

730
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:09,460
lot of the time I don't really get it

731
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:11,919
either I look inside myself and ask do I

732
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:14,559
feel like a man or a woman and after all

733
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:16,150
these years the answer is still that I

734
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:19,270
feel like [ __ ] and that's how I

735
00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:20,950
experienced gender I live I exist as a

736
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:22,780
woman which is the only way I can

737
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:24,250
achieve the same level of sadness and

738
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:27,220
dysfunction as everyone else

739
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:28,780
and I identify as trash I guess there

740
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:31,299
are certain moments that make me feel

741
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:33,940
like a natural woman no listening to

742
00:27:31,299 --> 00:27:36,040
Aretha Franklin the pain and ecstasy of

743
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:38,200
penetration waiting in a long ass line

744
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:40,330
for the restroom a big strong arm around

745
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:42,580
my waist being asked if I have any

746
00:27:40,330 --> 00:27:45,820
tampons having tampons in case someone

747
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:49,240
asks a dude explaining philosophy 101 to

748
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:50,799
me and me going oh really wow but you

749
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:52,660
know these experiences mean different

750
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:54,760
things at different people so all I can

751
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:57,370
really tell you is that I prefer to

752
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:59,530
express myself with diaphanous feminine

753
00:27:57,370 --> 00:28:01,360
gestures without taking female hormones

754
00:27:59,530 --> 00:28:03,100
and having feminizing medical procedures

755
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:04,960
makes me feel more at home in my body

756
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:07,320
and that I like it when other people

757
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:09,490
treat me as a woman socially spiritually

758
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:11,679
sexually so that's the jargon free

759
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:14,220
explanation of my gender as I see it am

760
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:16,480
I really truly a woman ontologically

761
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:18,730
neurologically metaphysically well

762
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:20,950
honestly I don't even know what that

763
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:22,930
would mean but I do know that the life I

764
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:25,870
live as a woman is the only life I

765
00:28:22,930 --> 00:28:28,180
have and that I think is legitimate

766
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:30,070
enough so I know it living as a woman

767
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:32,590
means to me but what does it mean to

768
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:33,880
live a non-binary life well just like

769
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:35,500
what it means to be a man or a woman

770
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:37,810
that's something that's gonna vary

771
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:39,190
between individuals and cultures some

772
00:28:37,810 --> 00:28:41,230
cultures have ancient third gender

773
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:43,570
traditions such as the Hedra of South

774
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:46,360
Asia a legally recognized gender in

775
00:28:43,570 --> 00:28:47,950
India Pakistan Nepal and Bangladesh for

776
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:49,480
the various two-spirit traditions of

777
00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:51,700
indigenous North American tribes

778
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:53,860
non-indigenous American culture doesn't

779
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:56,290
have a third gender tradition but we do

780
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:57,820
have individual non-binary people some

781
00:28:56,290 --> 00:28:59,170
of whom are making content that has

782
00:28:57,820 --> 00:29:01,210
taught me a lot about non-binary

783
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:03,460
experience non-binary bodies and

784
00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:06,250
non-binary life we have a lot in common

785
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:08,830
binary and non-binary trans people even

786
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:10,420
as a binary trans person I used to live

787
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:12,670
as one gender and now I live as another

788
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:14,560
gender that in itself is a pretty

789
00:29:12,670 --> 00:29:16,390
serious challenge to the stability of

790
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:18,460
the binary but many of the people who

791
00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:20,260
call themselves non-binary seem to be

792
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:21,880
fighting for something more radical than

793
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:23,500
what I'm fighting for at least in my

794
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:25,480
personal life I'm just trying to

795
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:29,410
assimilate into a pre-existing female

796
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:32,170
gender role as you can see by the normal

797
00:29:29,410 --> 00:29:34,420
way I'm dressed the traditional garb of

798
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:38,320
my culture or near near me or on ER me

799
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:40,300
or know where as non-binary people are

800
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:42,640
trying to cast off these roles entirely

801
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:44,950
they're effectively trying to create the

802
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:46,750
society that includes them and sometimes

803
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:48,360
that puts me at cross-purposes with some

804
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:50,830
non-binary people who for example

805
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:53,350
promote the practice of always asking

806
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:55,450
for someone's pronouns whereas I love it

807
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:58,240
when people assume my gender provided

808
00:29:55,450 --> 00:30:00,250
the assume it correctly otherwise I will

809
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:02,380
throw you an imaginary Canadian pronoun

810
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:04,420
jail but what we all agree on is that

811
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:06,520
many trans non-binary and gender

812
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:08,710
non-conforming people find it easier to

813
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:10,510
navigate the world using pronouns other

814
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:12,130
than the ones that Ben Shapiro wants you

815
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:14,290
to use so if you want me to call you a

816
00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:17,290
I'm gonna call you that and though I

817
00:30:14,290 --> 00:30:20,260
cannot and will not force you viewer to

818
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:22,480
do or say anything I do hope you use

819
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:24,400
your freewill to freely choose to use

820
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:28,080
your freedom of speech to choose to do

821
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:28,080
the same freely

822
00:30:32,770 --> 00:30:37,610
well at least there was a hideous

823
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:41,510
monster this time I'm talking about a

824
00:30:37,610 --> 00:30:44,150
female lead now the fun really begins

825
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:46,160
the show's over I'm gonna go take my

826
00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:49,310
tits out at a funeral parlor

827
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:54,680
so goodbye my Satanic subscribers until

828
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:54,820
