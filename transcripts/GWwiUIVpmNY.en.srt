1
00:00:01,159 --> 00:00:04,830
if you want to have an honest

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,700
conversation about race on the internet

3
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:08,069
here's what you do

4
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:10,290
you set your computer on fire you flee

5
00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:12,929
to the forest you drink a mimosa laced

6
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:17,580
with toad venom and you simply wait for

7
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:19,020
the Wolverines to eat your legs trust me

8
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:20,369
you're better off that way because if

9
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:23,039
you look for videos on YouTube about

10
00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:25,890
race well here's what you got you get

11
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:27,539
fascism racist pseudoscience racists

12
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:30,179
debate fascists tag team title match

13
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:32,399
tonight at nine or if you're lucky you

14
00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:33,510
got this so perhaps our legal system

15
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:35,340
isn't going around willy-nilly

16
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:36,390
convicting innocent black people of

17
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:38,190
crimes they didn't commit

18
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:40,290
perhaps individuals who happen to be

19
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:41,750
black are making bad choices for which

20
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:43,800
they have to deal with the consequences

21
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:45,420
racism isn't the explanation for

22
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,950
everything bad that happens to black

23
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,809
people if blacks are getting a shot and

24
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:50,489
going to jail more it's their fault for

25
00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:52,199
committing crimes that's right

26
00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:54,390
racial inequality in America exists

27
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:55,980
because black people simply decide to

28
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:57,390
commit more crimes for no reason I guess

29
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:59,430
he's probably gonna blame the rap music

30
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:01,770
or deadbeat dads with their sagging

31
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:02,940
pants I'd say that this is the most

32
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:04,920
common right-wing view of rates in

33
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:06,780
America it's not outright fascism or

34
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:08,610
race realism but simply the classical

35
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:10,610
liberal view that racial inequality is

36
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:13,530
the product not of injustice but of

37
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:14,010
black people simply deciding to make bad

38
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:15,659
choices

39
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:17,549
usually this idea gets whipped out as a

40
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:19,500
way to wave away the indisputable facts

41
00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:21,330
of racial inequality and dismiss those

42
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,860
pesky protesters always complaining

43
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:24,689
about things mmm they make me

44
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:26,130
uncomfortable and I don't like it this

45
00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:27,509
is what I'm gonna argue against in this

46
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:29,490
video we're gonna take a break from

47
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:31,590
talking about fascism in the past I

48
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:33,420
focused too much on the alright I think

49
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:35,100
we all have I mean don't get me wrong it

50
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:36,540
definitely is a dangerous movement but

51
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:38,400
it's just not the most consequential

52
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:39,990
kind of white supremacy that exists in

53
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,640
America in this video I want to talk

54
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:43,049
about the real root of racial inequality

55
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,610
in America which is the structural

56
00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:46,140
injustice that disadvantage as many

57
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:47,579
people of color and from now on I'm

58
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:49,710
gonna try not to get so distracted by

59
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:52,020
this circus sideshow of peppe's and

60
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:54,810
racist Oh Dennis and neo-nazi LARPers

61
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:57,899
all that stuff it's very last season I'm

62
00:01:54,810 --> 00:02:00,000
kind of over it oh god damn it hello

63
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:01,740
later Fritz get the hell out of here no

one cares about you anymore now a nice

65
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:08,099
house Anita half its name against Playa

68
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:12,569
transition

00:02:15,329 --> 00:02:19,140
could I possibly be a Nazi that's a good

72
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:20,549
question it's almost as if you're an

73
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:22,859
irrational person in your worldview

74
00:02:20,549 --> 00:02:24,750
makes no sense get out she calls me a

75
00:02:22,859 --> 00:02:27,030
Nazi and yet she is the one trying to

76
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:29,189
silence my free speech an excellent

77
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:31,349
example of how truly fascist the left

78
00:02:29,189 --> 00:02:32,819
has become look if your ideas stand up

79
00:02:31,349 --> 00:02:34,019
to rational scrutiny why aren't you

80
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:35,609
willing to discuss them in the free

81
00:02:34,019 --> 00:02:36,930
marketplace of ideas I'm going to

82
00:02:35,609 --> 00:02:38,719
discuss them in the free marketplace of

83
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:41,219
ideas as soon as you get out of my room

84
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:43,439
mom get out of my life well can we at

85
00:02:41,219 --> 00:02:45,780
least talk about the Jewish Question no

86
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:47,250
it's just ideas what are you afraid of

87
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:48,810
I'm afraid that I'm going to have to

88
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:51,720
blow the tabie whistle if you don't get

89
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:54,000
out of here in ten seconds ten nine Oh

90
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:55,680
baby come on I thought you would like to

91
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,780
think we used to whisper to me so

92
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,129
sweetly well not anymore

93
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:05,700
but do you at least want to buy some

94
00:02:59,129 --> 00:03:07,049
bite aloe max hey Jesus I don't like

95
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:08,879
doing this I prefer to have

96
00:03:07,049 --> 00:03:10,620
conversations about disagreements I

97
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:12,510
don't enjoy waving a bat around and

98
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:14,639
hissing like a cat but it's these people

99
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:15,000
they just give you no choice where were

100
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:16,889
we

101
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,629
right so racial injustice when I talk to

102
00:03:16,889 --> 00:03:20,489
people about this issue they often claim

103
00:03:18,629 --> 00:03:22,739
to have this experience that leftists

104
00:03:20,489 --> 00:03:25,290
react to them in two ways one by saying

105
00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:27,090
you're racist and two by saying it's not

106
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:28,739
my job to educate you and I'm sure this

107
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:30,659
isn't as universal as people say it is

108
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:32,310
but it does seem to be an experience a

109
00:03:30,659 --> 00:03:33,989
lot of people have and that's not good

110
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:35,790
because most people are pretty ignorant

111
00:03:33,989 --> 00:03:38,069
about this no offense and there's no

112
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:40,109
shortage of fascists race realists and

113
00:03:38,069 --> 00:03:43,349
classical liberals who are more than

114
00:03:40,109 --> 00:03:44,069
happy to educate people in their own

115
00:03:43,349 --> 00:03:46,169
special way

116
00:03:44,069 --> 00:03:47,819
so as I see it the left needs to step it

117
00:03:46,169 --> 00:03:49,500
up now to be fair if you're bothering

118
00:03:47,819 --> 00:03:51,540
random people of color on Twitter to

119
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:53,430
demand they explain racism to you you're

120
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:55,259
being kind of an [ __ ] and it's true

121
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:56,790
it's not their job to explain it to you

122
00:03:55,259 --> 00:03:59,129
they have other [ __ ] to do with their

123
00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:00,840
lives but I on the other hand do not

124
00:03:59,129 --> 00:04:02,519
have anything better to do than swerve

125
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,840
wildly out of my lane and whites blame

126
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:06,299
racism to you for the next 20 minutes

127
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:09,209
because it kind of is my job and I have

128
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:13,169
all the time in the world it's a funny

129
00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:15,269
thing time whose job is it to mend the

130
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:17,250
crimes of history do we have to take

131
00:04:15,269 --> 00:04:17,889
responsibility for things that happened

132
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:20,379
along

133
00:04:17,889 --> 00:04:23,379
I'm ago I don't even take responsibility

134
00:04:20,379 --> 00:04:24,639
for things I did before July this person

135
00:04:23,379 --> 00:04:27,370
who the [ __ ] is that

136
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,300
no I don't have any white guilt that's

137
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:29,979
not what this is about

138
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:31,719
that's just more weight narcissism is

139
00:04:29,979 --> 00:04:34,120
what that is so wipe away those white

140
00:04:31,719 --> 00:04:34,840
ass tears here I'll pick you out a

141
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:38,170
cotton ball

142
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:38,170
[Music]

143
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:50,970
one Freddie gray on April 12 2015

144
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:53,250
three police officers near a housing

145
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:54,900
project in West Baltimore arrested a 25

146
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:56,220
year old black man named Freddie gray

147
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:58,590
because he was carrying a

148
00:04:56,220 --> 00:05:00,600
spring-assisted knife that maybe was

149
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:04,949
illegal they handcuffed him and loaded

150
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:06,960
him into a police van and the van

151
00:05:04,949 --> 00:05:08,880
arrived at the police station Gray was

152
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:11,130
in a coma for some reason with three

153
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,440
fractured vertebrae and his spine 80%

154
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:15,120
severed at the neck a week later gray

155
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,770
died of his spinal injury while the

156
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,300
Baltimore Police released contradictory

157
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:20,340
and inadequate information about his

158
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:22,080
arrest this led to widespread protests

159
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:24,120
all over the city eventually culminating

160
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,560
in the notorious Baltimore riots now you

161
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:27,330
might be thinking what does it have to

162
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:28,650
do with racism if black people don't

163
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:30,330
want to be killed they shouldn't commit

164
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:31,979
crimes and run away from the police well

165
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:34,169
the first problem with that is that

166
00:05:31,979 --> 00:05:36,360
extrajudicial executions for nonviolent

167
00:05:34,169 --> 00:05:38,220
crimes shouldn't really be a common

168
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:39,870
thing in a civilized democracy and it's

169
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:41,580
a little alarming to me how quick you

170
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:42,780
are to defend this and the other problem

171
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:44,880
is that that's a very superficial

172
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:46,740
analysis that refuses to examine the

173
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:49,020
deeper reasons why black neighborhoods

174
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:50,520
tend to have more poverty more crime and

175
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:52,200
are subject to more aggressive policing

176
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:53,820
so let's delve a little deeper

177
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:55,620
starting with Freddie gray as a case

178
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:57,419
study Bray had a long arrest record of

179
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:59,130
mostly drug offenses and a lot of

180
00:05:57,419 --> 00:06:02,520
conservative commentators brought this

181
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:04,470
out as evidence that he was no angel the

182
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:06,330
implication I guess is that gray simply

183
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:08,220
gawa was coming to him that he deserved

184
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:09,960
to die but why did he commit all these

185
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:11,360
crimes in the first place I don't think

186
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:14,130
he was selling drugs for lack of

187
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:16,860
entrepreneurial ambition did he just do

188
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:18,780
it for no reason well let's see Freddie

189
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:19,289
gray was born in 1989 in the West

190
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:21,510
Baltimore neighborhood

191
00:06:19,289 --> 00:06:23,370
sandtown-winchester you can see in this

192
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:24,990
picture of him as a child that he grew

193
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:26,190
up in a dilapidated row house with

194
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:27,990
peeling LED paint

195
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:29,760
lead was used as a cheap additive at a

196
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:32,010
house paint until Congress banned it in

197
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:34,139
1978 because it caused a serious

198
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:35,760
cognitive damage in children leading to

199
00:06:34,139 --> 00:06:37,229
deficits and attention and increased

200
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:39,450
aggression which may explain why

201
00:06:37,229 --> 00:06:41,099
children poison the fled are seven times

202
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:43,080
more likely to drop out of school and

203
00:06:41,099 --> 00:06:45,000
six times more likely to end up in the

204
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:46,950
juvenile justice system but shitty

205
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,660
Baltimore slumlords often haven't

206
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:51,360
bothered to comply with a congressional

207
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:53,340
ban on lead paint and as a result 93

208
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,690
thousand children with lead poisoning

209
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:56,490
have been added to Maryland's lead

210
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:58,020
registry and in Baltimore the vast

211
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:58,670
majority of these children are black

212
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:00,470
many of

213
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:02,150
these kids were later awarded structured

214
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:04,190
settlements as compensation for a

215
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:06,140
permanent brain damage and Freddie gray

216
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:07,970
was one of these kids now you might be

217
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:10,190
thinking well reparations were paid out

218
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:12,680
so problem solved right well

219
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:14,870
unfortunately no what's happened is a

220
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:16,460
sub industry as emerged of shark lawyers

221
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:18,320
who swooped in on the lead poisoning

222
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:20,300
victims some of whom can't even read a

223
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:21,710
contract and offered a buyout they're

224
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:23,300
structured monthly settlements in

225
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:24,710
exchange for a lump sum that's a

226
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:26,150
fraction of the total worth of the

227
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:28,250
settlement and that's exactly what

228
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:30,530
happened to Freddie gray in 2013 a

229
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:32,210
company called access funding bought the

230
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:33,980
one hundred and forty six thousand

231
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:36,230
dollar remainder of his settlement for

232
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:37,670
18 thousand three hundred dollars they

233
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:39,410
also bought his sister's settlements

234
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:41,390
acquiring the entire four hundred and

235
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:43,340
thirty five thousand dollar Graceling

236
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:45,110
settlement for fifty four thousand

237
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:47,210
dollars now I hope we can all agree that

238
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:48,830
this is objectively bad but to

239
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:50,540
understand how it relates to structural

240
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:52,460
racism we have to look at Baltimore's

241
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:53,780
history of racial segregation or you

242
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:55,490
know we could just keep doing live

243
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:57,740
streams with Richard Spencer interviews

244
00:07:55,490 --> 00:08:01,070
with Nazis the new YouTube craze god

245
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:04,170
damn it I need to relax I need music

246
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:04,170
[Music]

247
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:11,050
- housing discrimination take a look at

248
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:12,340
this map which shows Baltimore

249
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:14,259
neighborhoods with children with

250
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:16,539
elevated lead levels between 2010 and

251
00:08:14,259 --> 00:08:18,580
2013 and compare it with this map of

252
00:08:16,539 --> 00:08:20,139
Baltimore's racial demographics yellow

253
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:23,130
dots is standing for black residents and

254
00:08:20,139 --> 00:08:26,800
blue dots standing for white led race

255
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:28,210
led race also notice how sharp the

256
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,789
divisions are between black and white

257
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:33,039
neighborhoods why in the 21st century is

258
00:08:30,789 --> 00:08:36,460
Baltimore still so segregated I thought

259
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:38,260
racism was over well here's the thing

260
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:40,510
about that when your country's history

261
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:44,100
is 400 years of slavery Jim Crow and

262
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:47,890
segregation you don't just get to say oh

263
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:50,890
sorry about it's all cool now though

264
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:52,630
right no it's not cool and these maps

265
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:54,640
are a pretty good illustration of one of

266
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:55,930
the major not cool things let's look at

267
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,520
how this [ __ ] happened in the first

268
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:59,230
place I hope I'm not being too

269
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:01,959
controversial if I propose that a

270
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:04,870
hundred years ago America may have been

271
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:07,060
somewhat racist in 1910 a Yale educated

272
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:08,770
black lawyer named W Ashby Hawkins

273
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:10,300
bought a house and a prestigious white

274
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:12,130
Baltimore neighborhood this produced

275
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:13,570
such an uproar among the way residents

276
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:15,580
that the city passed an ordinance

277
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:17,560
mandating the segregation of every

278
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:19,690
residential block basically the

279
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:21,850
ordinance forbade black people to buy or

280
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:23,920
rent houses on majority white blocks and

281
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:26,440
vice versa until the Supreme Court

282
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,910
overturned the ordinance in 1917 well if

283
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,350
the Supreme Court overturned the Jim

284
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:31,209
Crow laws then what's the problem

285
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:33,000
racism can't exist if black people have

286
00:09:31,209 --> 00:09:37,029
all the same rights as white people Wow

287
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:38,470
now that's actually not correct in 1934

288
00:09:37,029 --> 00:09:40,120
Congress created the Federal Housing

289
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:41,500
Administration to promote home ownership

290
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:43,720
in the midst of the Great Depression

291
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:45,730
when many homes were foreclosed one of

292
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:47,440
the FHA's purposes was to establish a

293
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:49,000
reliable credit system backed by the

294
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,740
government which would regulate interest

295
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,959
rates and insure the terms of mortgages

296
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:54,940
FHA backed loans played a critical role

297
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:56,500
in facilitating homeownership throughout

298
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:58,330
the middle of the 20th century the

299
00:09:56,500 --> 00:10:00,040
period many white Americans no remember

300
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:02,050
as the Golden Age of the American Dream

301
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:03,610
but many black Americans were excluded

302
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:05,230
from homeownership and the benefits that

303
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:07,390
conferred to white families particularly

304
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:09,070
the family financial stability it

305
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:12,040
enabled so how was this exclusion

306
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:14,050
possible well basically the FHA city

307
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:15,880
governments and white citizens adopted a

308
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:17,800
variety of subtle methods to enforce

309
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:19,300
residential segregation and deny home

310
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:21,670
ownership to black American

311
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:23,860
for instance one restrictive covenants

312
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:25,630
when the 1910 ordinance was overturned

313
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:27,580
Baltimore's mayor created an official

314
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:28,839
committee on segregation which

315
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:30,850
cooperated with neighborhood

316
00:10:28,839 --> 00:10:32,769
associations to pressure landlords and

317
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:34,540
white neighborhoods to sign covenants

318
00:10:32,769 --> 00:10:36,310
committing them never to sell or rent to

319
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:38,140
black residents these agreements were

320
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:39,790
enforced through strategic building and

321
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:41,920
health code citations issued against

322
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:44,410
owners and by evictions of black renters

323
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:47,140
who violated the covenant - redlining

324
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:48,820
the FHA adopted a policy of refusing to

325
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:50,620
insure mortgages and block neighborhoods

326
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:52,269
which were colored in red on official

327
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:53,200
maps giving the practice the name

328
00:10:52,269 --> 00:10:54,970
redlining

329
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,920
this effectively denied black citizens

330
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:59,110
accessed the government-backed mortgages

331
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:01,630
which in turn left them vulnerable to

332
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:03,310
three predatory lending unscrupulous

333
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:05,230
white sellers took advantage of black

334
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:07,300
buyers exclusion from FHA backed

335
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:09,279
mortgages exploiting lacks regulations

336
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:11,019
to design on fairly priced installment

337
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:13,329
plans with abusive terms which allowed

338
00:11:11,019 --> 00:11:14,980
for instance sellers to repossess and

339
00:11:13,329 --> 00:11:16,750
resell homes after a single missed

340
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:17,860
payment many black residents had no

341
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:19,600
choice but to buy into these

342
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:21,430
exploitative contracts and they often

343
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,050
resorted to subdividing houses or

344
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:24,610
neglecting repairs in order to make

345
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:26,020
payments further contributing to the

346
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:28,870
overcrowding and decay of black

347
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:30,730
neighborhoods for blockbusting predatory

348
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:32,470
real estate agents often used a scheme

349
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:34,089
known as block busting where they'd

350
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:35,800
intentionally provoke fear of an

351
00:11:34,089 --> 00:11:37,390
impending minority takeover among

352
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,860
residents of a white neighborhood they

353
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:40,839
would then exploit the fear that they

354
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:42,130
created to trick white homeowners into

355
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:44,620
selling their houses at below market

356
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:46,870
prices so they could resell those same

357
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:48,550
houses at extortionate prices to black

358
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:50,440
families desperate to escape the ghetto

359
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:52,089
the long-term effect of these practices

360
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:53,860
was that many black families ended up

361
00:11:52,089 --> 00:11:56,529
trapped in decaying neighborhoods with

362
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:58,270
bad schools little opportunity cyclical

363
00:11:56,529 --> 00:12:00,160
crime and poverty and aggressive

364
00:11:58,270 --> 00:12:01,959
discriminatory policing and even though

365
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:04,029
most of these segregation practices have

366
00:12:01,959 --> 00:12:06,339
ended the injustice remains unredressed

367
00:12:04,029 --> 00:12:08,199
no reparations have been paid to black

368
00:12:06,339 --> 00:12:09,490
families who were effectively robbed of

369
00:12:08,199 --> 00:12:11,440
homeownership during this period

370
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:13,329
predatory lending having cost black

371
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,310
families an estimated five hundred

372
00:12:13,329 --> 00:12:17,140
million dollars in Chicago alone the

373
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:19,060
worst of all is that segregation and

374
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:20,890
ghettoization caused by government backs

375
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:22,930
discrimination of the last century is

376
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:24,970
still ongoing I'm currently sitting in

377
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:27,040
my gentrifying white [ __ ] neighborhood

378
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:28,839
like one mile away from where Freddie

379
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,980
gray was arrested in a neighborhood

380
00:12:28,839 --> 00:12:32,380
that's like a whole different country

381
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:33,279
here's the 1937 redlining map of

382
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:35,649
Baltimore

383
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:38,050
now compare that to the 2013 population

384
00:12:35,649 --> 00:12:40,360
by race map if the 1937 map is the

385
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:42,040
product of racism and it is and if the

386
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:45,339
city still follows the same pattern of

387
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:47,769
segregation today and it does well it's

388
00:12:45,339 --> 00:12:50,199
almost as if the effects of racism have

389
00:12:47,769 --> 00:12:51,910
not entirely been eradicated it is not

390
00:12:50,199 --> 00:12:53,589
just Baltimore that's like this either

391
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:57,069
here are redlining maps of New York

392
00:12:53,589 --> 00:12:59,529
Chicago Philadelphia Atlanta Detroit New

393
00:12:57,069 --> 00:13:01,389
Orleans Cleveland LA all these cities

394
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:03,309
are still segregated as [ __ ] and it's

395
00:13:01,389 --> 00:13:05,589
not like a separate but equal situation

396
00:13:03,309 --> 00:13:07,720
either compare the 2013 population by

397
00:13:05,589 --> 00:13:09,639
race map of Baltimore to this map of

398
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:11,709
Baltimore police stops between 2010 and

399
00:13:09,639 --> 00:13:13,300
2015 that's black neighborhoods and red

400
00:13:11,709 --> 00:13:15,040
and green dots representing recorded

401
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:16,870
police stops of black pedestrians and

402
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,759
finally let's bring back the map of

403
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:20,860
childhood lead poisoning between 2010

404
00:13:18,759 --> 00:13:22,870
and 2013 now consider this information

405
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:24,850
in combination with some scientific

406
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:26,980
studies linking LED exposure and violent

407
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:28,660
crime and it almost starts to look like

408
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:30,759
there's some problems going on here that

409
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:32,379
might not be solved simply by telling

410
00:13:30,759 --> 00:13:34,149
black teenagers to tighten their belts

411
00:13:32,379 --> 00:13:35,740
and do less crimes but I don't want to

412
00:13:34,149 --> 00:13:37,540
overstate the lead crime theory either

413
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:39,220
because that only accounts for a small

414
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:41,019
fraction of what's going on here the

415
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:42,809
bigger picture is the lasting economic

416
00:13:41,019 --> 00:13:45,009
deprivation caused by segregation

417
00:13:42,809 --> 00:13:47,589
historical exclusion from home ownership

418
00:13:45,009 --> 00:13:49,839
the lost opportunities the bad schools

419
00:13:47,589 --> 00:13:51,790
in this country's ongoing insistence on

420
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:53,709
treating a problem of injustice as if it

421
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:55,000
were simply a problem of criminality I

422
00:13:53,709 --> 00:13:56,800
know I said my interest in this topic

423
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,889
isn't a matter of white guilt and it's

424
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:02,080
not but also fellow White's how do we

425
00:13:59,889 --> 00:14:04,630
sleep at night

426
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:06,820
in this guided meditation you're going

427
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:09,700
to relax your body and release your

428
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:12,370
guilt you're not responsible for what

429
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:14,980
your great-grandparents did as you use

430
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:17,980
the tension in each muscle group exhale

431
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:23,620
deeply and repeat the mantra black lives

432
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:26,440
matter are the real racists three mass

433
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:28,570
incarceration since the 1970s the United

434
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:30,970
States incarceration rate has rapidly

435
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:33,130
risen to the point where nearly 1 in 100

436
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:34,600
American men are in jail or prison we

437
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:37,180
now have the highest incarceration rate

438
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:38,890
in the world accounting for 22% of the

439
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:40,750
world's prisoners that we make up only

440
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:42,430
4.4 percent of the world's population

441
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:44,470
more than a third of the total

442
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:46,360
incarcerated population is black and the

443
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:48,100
black incarceration rate is almost six

444
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:49,540
times that of whites now without even

445
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:51,399
bringing race into it it's clear that

446
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:53,170
America has a prison problem in general

447
00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:54,970
sentences are too long too many

448
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:56,649
nonviolent drug offenders are in prison

449
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:58,360
too many defendants are pressured into

450
00:14:56,649 --> 00:15:00,250
plea bargains in a private prison

451
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:02,019
industry incentivizes high rates of

452
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:03,730
incarceration but disproportionately

453
00:15:02,019 --> 00:15:05,470
people of color are victimized by this

454
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:07,180
system now a lot of people are going to

455
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:08,770
look at the incarceration data and say

456
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:10,690
if the blocks don't like going to jail

457
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:11,950
they should just do less crimes let's do

458
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:13,600
another interview with Richard Spencer

459
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:15,310
you know what why don't we all interview

460
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,720
with you Spencer every single YouTube

461
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:18,550
free speech mandates that we all

462
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,980
constantly broadcast fascist propaganda

463
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:23,410
let's get them all in here every single

464
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:24,910
Nazi and one giant live stream and then

465
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:27,430
we can finally give the Jewish Question

466
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:29,470
the platform it deserve Saad damn it

467
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:30,850
where's my toad venom look it's just not

468
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:32,380
always the case that black people are

469
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:34,089
imprisoned more because they commit more

470
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:35,560
crimes for instance black and white

471
00:15:34,089 --> 00:15:37,300
people use weed at about the same rate

472
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:39,130
but black people are nearly four times

473
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:40,690
as likely to be arrested for it and

474
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:42,610
we're talking about a drug that at this

475
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:44,949
point white America has basically

476
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:46,540
decided shouldn't really even be illegal

477
00:15:44,949 --> 00:15:48,640
anyway so we've now got a ten billion

478
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:50,500
dollar legal marijuana industry and just

479
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:53,529
look what white people are doing to weed

480
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:55,750
mark Smith is the CEO of tumbleweed at a

481
00:15:53,529 --> 00:15:58,449
ganja preneur it's a strong strong

482
00:15:55,750 --> 00:16:00,430
sativa very high in lye meaning it's a

483
00:15:58,449 --> 00:16:02,949
great bronchodilator so I like to use it

484
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:04,630
when I work out yeah so in fact in the

485
00:16:02,949 --> 00:16:06,100
back of the limousine is only the one of

486
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:08,709
the only legal places you can consume

487
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:10,149
cannabis the whites are at it again

488
00:16:08,709 --> 00:16:11,589
they have gentrified to the marijuana

489
00:16:10,149 --> 00:16:13,360
and now we've got white businesspeople

490
00:16:11,589 --> 00:16:15,350
making millions of dollars selling the

491
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:17,060
same drug that black people are still

492
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:19,400
disproportionally incarcerated for

493
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:21,140
having sold ganja preneur do i do it

494
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:23,210
then gold on my fingers this is the most

495
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:24,680
basic kind of unfairness and if this

496
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:28,250
doesn't make you angry then either

497
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:30,800
you're really ignorant about this or you

498
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:32,000
might just not care about black people I

499
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,830
don't like to assume the worst of people

500
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,440
but when I look at the state of the

501
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:38,210
conversation about race in America I see

502
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:40,490
a lot of people who are willing to just

503
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:42,140
wave away the extrajudicial executions

504
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:44,090
of black people by the police the mass

505
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:45,980
incarceration of people of color and the

506
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:47,810
vicious history of discrimination in its

507
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:49,670
ongoing repercussions and from those

508
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:51,740
same people I see a tendency to get

509
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:53,900
extremely outraged by any black person

510
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:55,880
who takes a stand or takes a knee or

511
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:57,680
speaks up about this in any way there's

512
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:59,600
an endless mill of content about how

513
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:02,000
authoritarian and evil black lives

514
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:04,280
matter is and how its identity politics

515
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,950
equivalent to white nationalism and it's

516
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:08,870
unpatriotic and postmodern and racist

517
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:10,580
and I'm sorry but this group of creators

518
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:12,380
are being really melodramatic black

519
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:14,510
college students complaining too loudly

520
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:16,070
are not Orwell's nightmare if anything

521
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:17,660
in this country deserves to be called an

522
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:19,670
authoritarian nightmare it's locking

523
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:21,560
people in cages for decades over drug

524
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:23,360
offenses but right wing YouTube doesn't

525
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:24,950
seem very interested in using their free

526
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:27,170
speech to talk about that they're too

527
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:30,050
busy complaining about people using

528
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:31,910
their free speech to protests how dare

529
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:33,740
they now I can also anticipate another

530
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:36,140
objection that doesn't come from YouTube

531
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:37,970
fascists or stock salad-eating basic

532
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:39,410
white girl caricatures I imagine some

533
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:40,790
black people will probably watch this

534
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:42,500
video and think where does this white

535
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:44,300
[ __ ] get off telling me I'm a victim I

536
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:45,890
take responsibility for my own life

537
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:47,270
instead of blaming all my problems on

538
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:49,010
racism and here's the thing about that

539
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:51,290
you're actually right in the sense that

540
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:52,610
taking responsibility or taking control

541
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:54,920
of your life to the greatest extent

542
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:56,750
possible is actually a good way to live

543
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:58,430
your life as an individual so by all

544
00:17:56,750 --> 00:18:00,380
means don't allow yourself to be defined

545
00:17:58,430 --> 00:18:02,180
by victimhood do take control of your

546
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:03,650
destiny as much as possible so I'm not

547
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:05,060
saying anyone should blame all their

548
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:06,770
problems on bigotry and wallow and

549
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:08,810
victimhood please don't do that

550
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:10,760
go succeed as much as possible but also

551
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:13,040
while you're succeeding don't deny that

552
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:14,840
oppressive circumstances exist yes it's

553
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:16,820
possible for individuals to escape

554
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:18,680
oppressive circumstances but we also

555
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:20,630
have a collective duty to work to

556
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:22,340
eliminate the unjust conditions that

557
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:25,550
create those circumstances in the first

558
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:26,180
place wow I feel like I just gave a

559
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:28,250
great speech

560
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:29,159
would you take my speech less seriously

561
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:30,749
if you knew I

562
00:18:29,159 --> 00:18:32,609
had been drinking Bud Light Lime this

563
00:18:30,749 --> 00:18:34,019
entire time look I even put a lime in it

564
00:18:32,609 --> 00:18:35,369
but light lime with lime

565
00:18:34,019 --> 00:18:36,899
the official beverage of people who

566
00:18:35,369 --> 00:18:38,279
complain about people who complained too

567
00:18:36,899 --> 00:18:42,269
much about people who complain too much

568
00:18:38,279 --> 00:18:43,619
about racism for the final countdown I

569
00:18:42,269 --> 00:18:45,269
want to say two more things before I

570
00:18:43,619 --> 00:18:46,889
flee into the forest first there

571
00:18:45,269 --> 00:18:48,330
actually are more racial groups in

572
00:18:46,889 --> 00:18:50,159
America than just black people and white

573
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:51,629
people I've just narrowed the topic of

574
00:18:50,159 --> 00:18:52,979
discussion so this video isn't three

575
00:18:51,629 --> 00:18:54,599
hours long but there are lots of other

576
00:18:52,979 --> 00:18:56,070
kinds of racism in this country and

577
00:18:54,599 --> 00:18:57,899
someone should make videos about those

578
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:59,580
too second please don't get all your

579
00:18:57,899 --> 00:19:01,169
information from YouTube I've put some

580
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:02,849
links in the description with my sources

581
00:19:01,169 --> 00:19:04,259
and some further reading on the topic

582
00:19:02,849 --> 00:19:06,239
also don't get all your information

583
00:19:04,259 --> 00:19:08,159
about race and racism from white people

584
00:19:06,239 --> 00:19:10,139
like come on that should just be common

585
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:12,509
stuff so when this video ends what you

586
00:19:10,139 --> 00:19:14,399
should do is scroll down smash that

587
00:19:12,509 --> 00:19:15,960
unsubscribe button on a click that

588
00:19:14,399 --> 00:19:18,359
little bell so you no longer receive

589
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:19,830
notifications about my videos and then

590
00:19:18,359 --> 00:19:21,330
you should go subscribe to a bunch of

591
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:25,559
people of color and listen to what they

592
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:27,239
have to say um so like guess that's it

593
00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:28,950
I'm just kidding about the forests I

594
00:19:27,239 --> 00:19:33,409
don't [ __ ] with forests I'm really more

595
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:36,139
of an indoor [ __ ] so I guess I'll just

596
00:19:33,409 --> 00:19:40,549
go sing a song about fighting racists

597
00:19:36,139 --> 00:19:40,549
mine eyes have seen

598
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:52,299
he is trampling out the vintage where

599
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:56,289
The Grapes of Wrath are stoned

600
00:19:52,299 --> 00:20:02,460
he hath loosed the fateful lightning of

601
00:19:56,289 --> 00:20:02,460
his terrible Swift sword his

602
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:29,289
[Music]

603
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:41,150
as he died to make men holy let us died

604
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:53,359
to make men free

605
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:53,359
[Music]

606
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:58,290
no regard

607
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:05,930
[Music]

608
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:09,400
that's the capitalism and the patriarchy

609
