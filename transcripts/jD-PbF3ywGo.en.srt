4
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:38,780
think I'm bougie and you're here to take

5
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:41,390
me to the guillotine well fair enough

6
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:43,340
but before you do can a dying Queen make

7
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:46,010
one request how about this

8
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:47,870
I'm minutia Harris on so you can cut my

9
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:50,720
head off but first you have to let me

10
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:52,520
tell you my life story fair that's super

11
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:54,559
[ __ ] great now sit on [ __ ] and allow

12
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:57,320
me to explain myself I'll start at the

13
00:00:54,559 --> 00:01:00,050
beginning my earliest memories are of

14
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:02,270
aesthetic bliss I was raised in a suburb

15
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:04,100
of Washington DC where the most exciting

16
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:05,509
attraction for children is the National

17
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:06,860
Museum of Natural History

18
00:01:05,509 --> 00:01:09,050
at least it's the most exciting

19
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:11,060
attraction for nerdy children who might

20
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:13,520
I add deserve their abuse at the hands

21
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:15,710
of dumber cooler children kids usually

22
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,869
gather around the fossils and don't get

23
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:19,700
me wrong I liked a good Stegosaurus as

24
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:21,770
much as the next five-year-old but my

25
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:25,100
real passion was the Gem and Mineral

26
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:26,869
haul ah the sparkle and shimmer it

27
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:27,440
inspired me to start my own little gem

28
00:01:26,869 --> 00:01:32,030
collection

29
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:34,220
I had amethyst quartz obsidian Jade the

30
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:35,690
little pressure of each stone was almost

31
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:37,729
enough to make up for my sixth grade

32
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:38,569
teacher mrs. Romano forcing me to pee my

33
00:01:37,729 --> 00:01:41,090
pants in public

34
00:01:38,569 --> 00:01:45,080
[ __ ] you Romano I'm glad your father

35
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:46,849
died comrades losers and haters I would

36
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:49,000
like to propose that aesthetic

37
00:01:46,849 --> 00:01:52,009
sensibility whether for gemstones

38
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,280
architecture fashion or music begins

39
00:01:52,009 --> 00:01:57,470
with absolute pleasure you rotate the

40
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,929
crystal in your hand and are dazzled by

41
00:01:57,470 --> 00:02:02,149
the sparkle and the light your nape hair

42
00:01:59,929 --> 00:02:05,119
stands on end and a tingle goes down

43
00:02:02,149 --> 00:02:08,030
your spine yes God but as you get older

44
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:10,700
things get more complicated Northern

45
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:12,349
Virginia is McMansion country and while

46
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:14,569
my family lived in a more modest

47
00:02:12,349 --> 00:02:16,310
colonial I remember riding around in the

48
00:02:14,569 --> 00:02:18,680
back of the minivan looking at some

49
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:20,330
stylistically jumbled monstrosities and

50
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,530
I would get excited by some little

51
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:24,290
detail like

52
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:26,150
a circle of fake battlements atop a

53
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:29,480
misplaced tower but then my mom would

54
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:31,880
say look at this ostentatious trash so

55
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:33,920
you learn you learn taste according to

56
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:36,830
the social class of your upbringing and

57
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:40,430
with taste comes all this adult baggage

58
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:41,569
snobbery and pretense and conceit so I

59
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:44,360
don't know what you've heard from my

60
00:02:41,569 --> 00:02:46,640
accusers but I assure you I have nothing

61
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:48,860
to do with taste I am but a simple queen

62
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:52,970
longing for the pleasure of my childhood

63
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:54,920
gem so stripy sock cat girls of the heck

64
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:57,500
and Revolutionary Committee before you

65
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:59,290
pass sentence allow me to make my case

66
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:15,390
Gorge

00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:16,930
[Music]

68
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:22,569
the

69
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:26,709
what success oh hey how are you cords

70
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:28,239
look Alex stuff I like shiny things from

71
00:03:26,709 --> 00:03:30,340
either really is still a simple

72
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:32,860
childlike pleasure to it all but the

73
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:35,170
adult reality is opulence is more than

74
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:38,109
just shimmer and sparkle there's a

75
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:40,359
social context for it it generally means

76
00:03:38,109 --> 00:03:42,370
something why does Donald Trump's

77
00:03:40,359 --> 00:03:44,200
apartment look like Liberace married a

78
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:46,299
Turkmenistan II dictator and moved into

79
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:48,370
a Cheesecake Factory well because he's

80
00:03:46,299 --> 00:03:51,310
trying to send a message maybe to the

81
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:54,760
world maybe to himself he's saying

82
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:56,889
behold I am a winner a very stable

83
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:59,079
genius with one of the highest IQs

84
00:03:56,889 --> 00:04:00,909
powerful people have often used opulence

85
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:02,650
to symbolize their power from the

86
00:04:00,909 --> 00:04:04,900
Pharaohs of Egypt to the kings of France

87
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:06,760
to even the humble servants of the

88
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:08,530
world's major religions I guess it's

89
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:10,959
been called like shiny things too in

90
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:13,659
America opulence more specifically means

91
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:15,609
not just power but success it is the

92
00:04:13,659 --> 00:04:18,340
trophy by which you show the world that

93
00:04:15,609 --> 00:04:20,709
you achieved the American dream the plot

94
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:22,870
line of our central cultural myth is the

95
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:24,880
story of rags to riches and the words of

96
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:26,979
drake started from the bottom now we're

97
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:30,490
here started from the bottom now the

98
00:04:26,979 --> 00:04:32,680
whole team spiky hair opulence is the

99
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:35,949
aesthetic display that you're here

100
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:37,360
you've made it your rich bed remember in

101
00:04:35,949 --> 00:04:39,970
high school when you had to read The

102
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,830
Great Gatsby by f scott sparknotes the

103
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:43,870
character Jay Gatsby doesn't even like

104
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:45,760
opulent mansion parties but he throws

105
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:47,860
them anyway just to show his crush Daisy

106
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:50,560
that he's made it that he's a success

107
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:52,930
but he's worth something and as we all

108
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,820
remember in the end they get married and

109
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:56,680
defeat the monster Grendel to save the

110
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:57,789
whole of her off-guard at least that's

111
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:00,190
what I wrote in my 10th grade English

112
00:04:57,789 --> 00:05:03,190
essay about how the theme of the Great

113
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:05,349
Gatsby is money always leads to

114
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:07,960
happiness I've got a d-minus

115
00:05:05,349 --> 00:05:08,409
I like dollars I like diamonds I like

116
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:10,340
money

117
00:05:08,409 --> 00:05:12,710
I like shining I like those

118
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:14,330
Lancey yoga's bak I'm sure cardi B

119
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:15,980
really does like diamonds and red

120
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:18,710
bottoms and driving lambs and all that

121
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:20,570
[ __ ] but teacher picked me picked me

122
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:22,460
let's talk about symbols let's talk

123
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:25,430
about allegory let's talk about metaphor

124
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:28,160
let's talk about themes fellow students

125
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:31,040
let us place the texts in historical

126
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:33,050
context everyone knows that cardi B went

127
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:36,560
from being a teenage stripper to making

128
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:38,870
money moves that's the American dream

129
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:41,390
hip-hop opulence isn't just gratuitous

130
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:43,250
glitz and hedonism it's a celebration of

131
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:44,810
success for people who often come from

132
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:46,610
backgrounds where that kind of success

133
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:48,140
is really improbable don't you think

134
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:51,260
it's kind of weird that conservatives

135
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:53,720
still say react musically nor the

136
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:55,550
problems with the blacks for

137
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:57,860
conservatives the American Dream is

138
00:05:55,550 --> 00:06:00,140
supposed to be the solution to poverty

139
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:01,880
and is there any sector of our culture

140
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:04,250
where the American Dream is more on

141
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:06,470
ironically celebrated than hip-hop it's

142
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:08,660
not just hip-hop though flaunted wealth

143
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:10,640
is pretty inescapable throughout pop

144
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:12,230
culture you can't even turn on the radio

145
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:14,330
without hearing about the Gucci and the

146
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:16,100
Ferraris and the Fendi love of God is in

147
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:18,290
the Omani in the Maseratis our entire

148
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:21,590
culture has been replaced by a parade of

149
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:24,620
overpriced Italian [ __ ] which to be

150
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:26,120
clear I'm completely in favor of burned

151
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:27,980
down the Statue of Liberty for all I

152
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:30,020
[ __ ] care and replace it with a

153
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:32,060
large-scale figure of Donatella Versace

154
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:33,710
holding a bottle of Cristal that's at

155
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:35,510
least a more honest representation of

156
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:37,430
our culture than the hypocritical cheese

157
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:37,940
furs currently inscribed on Liberty

158
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:40,760
Island

159
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:43,160
I guess crystals French isn't it well no

160
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:44,990
one really drinks Italian booze we we

161
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:47,870
have standards in this country listen up

162
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:50,270
America we live in a society a society

163
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:55,070
of champagne wishes and caviar dreams

164
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:57,980
not of climbers but of graspers to

165
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:59,390
paraphrase Ian Danskin maybe anyone can

166
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:02,780
achieve the American

167
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:06,410
but everyone cannot and the fact of the

168
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:08,060
matter is most people don't I mean what

169
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:10,280
would it even mean to be rich unless

170
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:12,680
someone else was poor I mean who's gonna

171
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:14,570
polish your golden toilet not on the

172
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:16,490
rich people that's for sure so when you

173
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:18,830
live in a society that constantly

174
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:21,020
equates wealth and success but which is

175
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:24,440
also so unequal that most people will

176
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:31,790
never be wealthy well what's the average

177
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:33,980
person supposed to do to fantasy I wish

178
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:36,500
the world were my gem collection I wish

179
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:38,330
I owned everything I'm really just the

180
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:40,630
worst kind of Philistine you know I go

181
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:41,750
to an art museum and it's like Monet

182
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:44,090
Rembrandt

183
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:47,420
okay that's super [ __ ] great but can

184
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:50,600
i buy it well no I can't buy it the grim

185
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:54,320
reality is you can't own everything so

186
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:56,360
what do you do well you fake it you

187
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:58,790
create an illusion

188
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:00,620
I don't own this building now you boob

189
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:03,230
off the streets of Baltimore can walk in

190
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:05,930
here as indeed you did that's okay I

191
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:10,730
need a witness I need you to see me here

192
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:12,500
among the other art where I'm being seen

193
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:15,950
that way it makes me feel good you know

194
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:18,110
makes me feel valuable you know you

195
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:19,640
don't actually need wealth to be opulent

196
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:22,670
because opulence

197
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:25,250
is not abundance opulence is the

198
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:27,850
aesthetic of abundance it is the

199
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:31,370
aesthetic of owning everything

200
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:33,650
the phrase opulence you own everything

201
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:36,370
is at this point basically a gay

202
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:36,370
internet meme

203
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:41,120
but it originally comes from the

204
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:43,219
documentary Paris is burning up at the

205
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:47,439
Harlem ballroom culture in the 1980s

206
00:08:43,219 --> 00:08:47,439
words proclaimed by MC junior labeija

207
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:53,309
[Music]

208
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:58,550
it's not a celebration of a real

209
00:08:56,420 --> 00:09:00,800
lifestyle of luxury and decadence in

210
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:02,720
fact as pepper labeija says of the queer

211
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,519
black and latin-american participants of

212
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,819
the Bulls you know a lot of those kids

213
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:09,949
and boys they don't have to of nothing

214
00:09:06,819 --> 00:09:11,930
some of them don't even eat so ballroom

215
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:14,360
opulence is a fantasy of wealth and

216
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:16,759
glamour an illusion created by skillful

217
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:17,930
artifice participants walk categories

218
00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:19,879
like executive realness

219
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:22,129
with the goal of being indistinguishable

220
00:09:19,879 --> 00:09:24,350
from a real executive nowadays every

221
00:09:22,129 --> 00:09:26,209
white queer says the word realness I got

222
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:28,730
some kind of a frivolous way I mean

223
00:09:26,209 --> 00:09:31,129
whose tamang us honestly hasn't slipped

224
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:33,110
into a dissociative fugue state dressed

225
00:09:31,129 --> 00:09:35,029
up as a clown kidnapped a few

226
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:37,430
neighborhood children and told the cops

227
00:09:35,029 --> 00:09:40,279
I'm giving you John Wayne Gacy realness

228
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:42,649
hunty I did it officer I did the

229
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:45,470
cultural appropriation I am a colonizer

230
00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:48,230
I am part of the problem and I'm sorry

231
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:50,660
take me away boys that's crazy that's

232
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:52,550
mega coconuts I guess I should explain

233
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:54,829
that American slang works according to

234
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:56,870
what we might call a trickle up model of

235
00:09:54,829 --> 00:09:58,430
linguistics all the new words are

236
00:09:56,870 --> 00:10:00,110
invented by the most marginalized gay

237
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:01,730
and trans people of color then those

238
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:03,949
words trickle up to straight black

239
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:06,050
people and white gays and then finally

240
00:10:03,949 --> 00:10:07,819
white sis hats start using them a lot of

241
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:10,100
times the original meaning or context

242
00:10:07,819 --> 00:10:12,829
gets lost along the way so originally

243
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:14,809
realness as Shawn fate put it was not

244
00:10:12,829 --> 00:10:17,720
just a sassy by word for a convincing

245
00:10:14,809 --> 00:10:19,569
costume but a tragic comic disguise of

246
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:23,300
the chasm between what is being emulated

247
00:10:19,569 --> 00:10:26,600
and what is absent namely racial justice

248
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:28,519
Casa quality and safety realness in that

249
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:30,379
sense is a much more complicated and

250
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:33,319
interesting concept than the generic

251
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:35,360
trans notion of passing passing is just

252
00:10:33,319 --> 00:10:37,189
looking like a 5-2 happy baby bouncy bio

253
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,139
girl whereas in the ballroom sense

254
00:10:37,189 --> 00:10:41,449
realness has a subtext of defying

255
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:43,590
injustice you're using artifice to

256
00:10:41,449 --> 00:10:45,420
create the illusion of a lifestyle

257
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:48,150
that has been unjustly kept beyond your

258
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:49,650
reach you're not really an executive but

259
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:51,180
you're looking like the executive and

260
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:53,580
therefore you're storing the straight

261
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:54,900
world that I can be an executive if I

262
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:57,570
had the opportunity I could be able

263
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:58,920
because I can look like I think one

264
00:10:57,570 --> 00:11:01,350
reason there's been a surge of interest

265
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:03,630
in eighties ballroom culture such as the

266
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:05,910
FX drama pose which is said during the

267
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:07,770
era is that it dramatizes an essential

268
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:09,390
truth about America it's really

269
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:11,130
important to people in this country to

270
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:13,650
at least sometimes feel like they're

271
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:15,750
living a luxe life even if in fact they

272
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:17,730
aren't Las Vegas is essentially an

273
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:19,860
entire city that exploits that need

274
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:22,320
Vegas hotels like the Venetian the

275
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:24,570
Bellagio and Caesars Palace are designed

276
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,860
to make you feel like a fancy [ __ ] even

277
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:27,630
though they're actually just high-rise

278
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:29,130
traps designed to lure you in and take

279
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:39,720
your money and if there's one thing I

280
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:41,190
can't stand it's try but the trap works

281
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:43,110
because part of what it is to be

282
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:45,870
American is to want to feel like a fancy

283
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:47,820
[ __ ] I actually love Vegas I was there

284
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:49,740
last year for the only good YouTube for

285
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:51,630
Lindsay Ellis's bachelorette party I

286
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:53,280
felt like a fancy [ __ ] and I wasn't

287
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:55,590
tempted to gamble but when I was younger

288
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:57,420
I don't when I was in my mid 40s I did

289
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:59,730
once experienced the first exciting

290
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:01,380
stages of a gambling habit I happened to

291
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:03,630
go to the casino once out of curiosity

292
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:05,640
and had some good luck playing blackjack

293
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:07,920
I mean I wasn't a high roller or

294
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:10,290
anything but my first time I walked out

295
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:12,240
with an extra $200 and that was a lot of

296
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:14,520
money to me at the time I was working a

297
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:18,240
customer service job making $10 an hour

298
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:21,150
so to make $200 in five minutes that's

299
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:24,870
worth 20 hours of soul-crushing customer

300
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:27,240
service toil before taxes so I went back

301
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:29,670
and I went back but I never got lucky

302
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:32,010
again and fortunately that was enough to

303
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:34,020
discourage me I remember one time as I

304
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:36,150
was leaving the casino I saw this man

305
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:38,190
standing outside with this look on his

306
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:41,670
face that I have never seen on a human

307
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:45,570
being before or Suns just absolute shock

308
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:47,640
despair this deep shame and self-disgust

309
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:49,350
the kind of face that says I'm gonna

310
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:51,150
have to explain to my wife

311
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:53,220
I spent the kids college savings on a

312
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:55,680
high limit slot machine and there is

313
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:57,660
nothing opulent about that north of

314
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:59,430
people at the slots and wheelchairs with

315
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:03,810
IV drips trying to pay off their

316
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:04,800
hospital bills America we are a bad

317
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:07,050
country

318
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:09,120
Donald Trump is a Vegas man he's pulling

319
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:10,980
this grift on the entire country and it

320
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:13,440
keeps working because the fantasy

321
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:15,780
opulence of the American dream is more

322
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:18,000
enchanting to the imagination than any

323
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:20,520
abstract mathematics of economic

324
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,800
equality so it may seem like Americans

325
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:24,630
are all under the same spell but in fact

326
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,490
there are two very different types of

327
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:28,770
magic at work for the wealthy and

328
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:30,630
powerful opulence is a flex a

329
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:32,130
demonstration of their wealth and power

330
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:35,040
but for the marginalized and

331
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:36,690
impoverished opulence is a simulacrum of

332
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:39,180
the wealth and power they've been denied

333
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:41,160
the aesthetic might be similar but in

334
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:43,080
terms of function it's like the

335
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:46,400
difference between a viper and a

336
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:50,370
butterfly serving viper realness

337
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:54,080
three-class hey how are you hey how are

338
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:56,490
you hey how are you hey how are you

339
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:58,140
people don't understand how difficult it

340
00:13:56,490 --> 00:14:00,300
is to be this blond you know a

341
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:02,910
biological female that looks like me I'm

342
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:04,830
afraid some transvestite psycho is gonna

343
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:06,930
sneak in through a rear window and I'll

344
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:08,160
have to dial M for murder I get vertigo

345
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:09,780
just thinking about it

346
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,520
I've always found the Marxist analysis

347
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:12,480
of class difficult to apply to the

348
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:14,160
present day

349
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:16,200
as a typical modern woman it's just

350
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,880
super [ __ ] hard for me to relate to

351
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:20,760
this and I hope and I hope and I hope

352
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:24,210
that's process like Boosh mozzie and

353
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:26,190
proletarian hoops - is she where's her

354
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:28,650
summer collection that's super [ __ ]

355
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:30,420
greement can I buy it Marx's typical

356
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:32,970
examples are a factory owner in a

357
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:35,190
factory worker no I could be out of

358
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:37,560
touch but personally I've never met a

359
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:39,330
factory worker or a factory owner for

360
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:41,700
that matter they must all be on a brand

361
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:42,870
trip to China working on the BMPs on her

362
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:44,220
collection was

363
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:46,200
supposed to distinguish the booties from

364
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:47,670
the proles is that the bougie zone the

365
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:49,380
means of production and the proles

366
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:51,480
worked for wages but what about a

367
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:53,850
bartender who owns the bar she works and

368
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:55,890
what about youtubers which side of the

369
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:57,570
revolution are we on I'm just trying to

370
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:59,220
figure out where I stand here because if

371
00:14:57,570 --> 00:15:01,230
the revolution starts on Twitter my head

372
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:02,700
is definitely going in the basket and

373
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:04,640
then I'll have no choice but to do the

374
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:06,839
conservative talk show circuit you know

375
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:08,430
like most people whose brains are

376
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:10,980
detached from their bodies Marie

377
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:12,870
Antoinette did nothing wrong in our yo I

378
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:15,330
feel like a class analysis with only two

379
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:17,190
classes must be overly simplistic my

380
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:19,380
favorite book about class in America is

381
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:21,630
Paul Fussell's class a guide through the

382
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:23,970
American status system which describes

383
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:25,589
nine distinct classes Fussel is not as

384
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:27,930
concerned with economic relations

385
00:15:25,589 --> 00:15:30,180
between classes as he is with status

386
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:32,460
when Marxist sometimes call social and

387
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:35,250
cultural capital things like education

388
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:37,710
style taste an attitude towards money

389
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:39,420
now the book was published in 1983 so a

390
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:41,100
lot of the references and details are

391
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:42,750
out of date but there's an eerie

392
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:44,700
familiarity to a lot of the core

393
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:46,589
observations and it's also just pretty

394
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:48,450
funny like his quasi scientific

395
00:15:46,589 --> 00:15:50,160
observation that the higher your social

396
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:52,110
class the smaller the balls and the

397
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:54,330
sports you play or his description of

398
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:56,730
middle-class living rooms your real

399
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:59,190
middle class refuses to show any but the

400
00:15:56,730 --> 00:16:01,830
most bland books and magazines on its

401
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:04,740
coffee tables otherwise expressions of

402
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:07,020
opinion awkward questions are even ideas

403
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:08,640
might result what I've Fussell's core

404
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:10,770
themes is that it's not how much money

405
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:12,870
you have that defines your class so much

406
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:14,700
is how you got your money if you had to

407
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:17,490
work for your money then you're not

408
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:19,620
really upper class the upper class has

409
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:21,570
inherited wealth and as a result they're

410
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:24,390
very confident they don't feel the need

411
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:26,730
to prove themselves likewise the lower

412
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:28,560
classes have basically accepted their

413
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:30,600
position on the ladder but then there's

414
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:32,130
the middle class who are social climbers

415
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:35,339
and who compensate for their

416
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:37,500
insecurities by for example placing a

417
00:16:35,339 --> 00:16:39,300
pretentious collage of university bumper

418
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:40,019
stickers in the back of the family car

419
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:42,029
this is

420
00:16:40,019 --> 00:16:43,829
meaning of the Lord Melbourne quote the

421
00:16:42,029 --> 00:16:45,929
higher and lower crosses there's some

422
00:16:43,829 --> 00:16:48,809
good in them but the middle classes are

423
00:16:45,929 --> 00:16:52,019
all affectation and conceit and pretend

424
00:16:48,809 --> 00:16:54,269
some concealment now opulent aesthetics

425
00:16:52,019 --> 00:16:55,889
are typically cultivated by people with

426
00:16:54,269 --> 00:16:58,079
something to prove whether its

427
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:59,939
marginalized ballroom performers proving

428
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:01,769
their worth to themselves or the new

429
00:16:59,939 --> 00:17:03,449
rich building McMansions to show off

430
00:17:01,769 --> 00:17:05,399
their wealth to others so there's

431
00:17:03,449 --> 00:17:07,919
something kind of odd about Donald Trump

432
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:09,839
he inherited his wealth so he should

433
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:12,990
know better than to have golden faucets

434
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:15,779
but he doesn't as Fran Lebowitz said

435
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:18,000
he's a poor person's idea of a rich

436
00:17:15,779 --> 00:17:20,399
person and that's actually his charm

437
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,799
it's part of his mass appeal Trump

438
00:17:20,399 --> 00:17:24,270
behaves like a pro who won the lottery

439
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:26,640
so there's actually something kind of

440
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:28,620
relatable on snobbish and even pseudo

441
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:31,500
democratic about the golden faucets

442
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:34,620
people who have wealth but not class are

443
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:37,340
actually very popular in this country we

444
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:40,200
don't like class here because class is

445
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:42,960
exclusionary whereas anyone can acquire

446
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:45,779
wealth we tell ourselves so wealth feels

447
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:48,000
potentially inclusive of everyone even

448
00:17:45,779 --> 00:17:49,500
though in practice it isn't now the

449
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,870
upper-class cultural elite in this

450
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:54,299
country the real classy people are

451
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:56,399
mostly very unlike Trump instead of

452
00:17:54,299 --> 00:17:58,620
being ostentatious and gaudy they

453
00:17:56,399 --> 00:18:01,100
embrace the reserved old money values of

454
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:03,330
aristocratic wasps white anglo-saxon

455
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:05,669
Protestants Fussel notes for instance

456
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:07,679
that they tend to value privacy over

457
00:18:05,669 --> 00:18:09,510
showing off they like to live at the end

458
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:11,549
of long driveways and houses away from

459
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:13,049
public view they dressed down while

460
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:14,940
traveling so as to avoid drawing

461
00:18:13,049 --> 00:18:16,740
attention to themselves these are

462
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:18,750
essentially survival skills of the

463
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:21,179
experienced rich if you flaunt your

464
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:23,460
wealth too much people might rob you or

465
00:18:21,179 --> 00:18:25,380
they might get benefits and come after

466
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:29,820
you with pitchforks and guillotines or

467
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:32,100
worse taxation old money knows this but

468
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:34,500
new money just cannot resist the

469
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:36,270
temptation to show off I actually wonder

470
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,750
if the old waspy upper class is dying

471
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:38,279
out

472
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:40,679
I feel like Donald Trump represents a

473
00:18:38,279 --> 00:18:42,779
victory of money over class his

474
00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:45,270
presidency validates the idea that you

475
00:18:42,779 --> 00:18:47,399
can be as vulgar as you want so long as

476
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:49,140
you have the cash to back it up so the

477
00:18:47,399 --> 00:18:51,420
old class system is dying

478
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:53,250
and in its place we have universally

479
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:55,890
adopted the mindset of the nouveau riche

480
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:57,840
if you got it flaunt it

481
00:18:55,890 --> 00:18:59,850
if you haven't got it find a way to

482
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:01,560
flaunt it anyway now I'm sure this is

483
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:04,530
all very tragic and disappointing to

484
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:07,350
people of class and taste but to a tacky

485
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:13,460
transsexual rhinestone connoisseur it's

486
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:16,740
actually fantastic news for taste

487
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:19,050
listen comrades I've been pretty down on

488
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:21,000
opulence so far and I could continue

489
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:23,430
analyzing it in terms of inequality and

490
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,830
class struggle but you already know all

491
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:28,770
that that's why you came to cut my head

492
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:31,410
off but hold on is that really all there

493
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:33,930
is to esthetics Marxist economic

494
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:36,060
analysis or the SJW version that makes

495
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:37,980
everything about race and gender as the

496
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:40,230
most notorious art critic of the 21st

497
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:42,750
century once said but remember that it's

498
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:44,970
both possible and even necessary to

499
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:46,470
simultaneously enjoy media while also

500
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:49,170
being critical of it's more problematic

501
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:51,330
or pernicious aspects so what about the

502
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:52,770
enjoyment part surely you wouldn't be

503
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:55,110
had a queen just for liking a shiny

504
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:57,240
thing is there no room for art for art's

505
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:59,670
sake the great philosopher and venerable

506
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:01,980
German closet Queen Froylan Immanuel

507
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:03,900
Hildegard Marlena Kennedy Davenport [ __ ]

508
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:06,270
so that pure aesthetic taste is

509
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:08,730
disinterested that is completely free of

510
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:10,740
any material desire of course miss thing

511
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:12,660
also founded the hashtag no fab movement

512
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:14,370
so I don't know how seriously we want to

513
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:15,750
take of that it's actually kind of

514
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:17,790
similar to what Plato said about

515
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:19,200
aesthetic sense that it merely begins

516
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:21,090
with a desire for the bodies of

517
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,620
beautiful boys which is really just a

518
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:24,630
shadow of our true longing for the

519
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:26,340
concept of beauty itself God the entire

520
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:28,170
history of Western aesthetic philosophy

521
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:29,910
is just a bunch of repressed homos

522
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:32,310
trying to rationalize away their debates

523
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:33,720
perversions what must that be like from

524
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:35,430
the bottom of my [ __ ] and my

525
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:36,750
father [ __ ] heart that must be super

526
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:39,300
[ __ ] hard for them I can't even a

527
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:41,190
matte I mean it makes sense really

528
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:43,380
straight men don't have these problems

529
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:44,790
they got away with painting softcore for

530
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:46,980
500 years and never had to think about

531
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:49,440
it I guess Nietzsche's the exception he

532
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:51,420
was straight and a philosopher but he

533
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:53,370
was an in cell and let's be honest

534
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:55,110
definitely a true chaser

535
00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:57,660
the only upstanding aesthetician in all

536
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:59,430
of Western history is the respectable

537
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:02,070
English gentleman Oscar Wilde

538
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:02,540
according to Wilde those who find ugly

539
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:05,250
me

540
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:08,040
beautiful things are corrupt without

541
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:10,470
being charming this is a fault those who

542
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:12,720
find beautiful meanings and beautiful

543
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:14,070
things are the cultivated for these

544
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,410
there is hope

545
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:18,690
they are the elect to whom beautiful

546
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:20,790
things mean only beauty

547
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:23,280
spoken like a poet you want to be

548
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:24,870
cultivated don't you don't you think I'm

549
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:26,910
beautiful look I'll play it your way

550
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:30,590
let's swing back to the other side of

551
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:30,590
the sarkeesian pendulum here a

552
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:35,580
sentimental as I personally am about art

553
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:37,770
for art's sake and all that from a

554
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:40,800
strictly a sociological perspective I

555
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:42,809
have to admit taste is pretty intimately

556
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:44,940
related to power when you go to a museum

557
00:21:42,809 --> 00:21:46,920
you look at various objects on pedestals

558
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:48,840
under special lighting that makes them

559
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:50,610
appear magical now that's also what you

560
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:52,380
do at Bed Bath and Beyond but the

561
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:54,690
difference is that at the Museum you

562
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:57,150
can't buy anything and that turns out to

563
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:59,070
be important for contine reasons and the

564
00:21:57,150 --> 00:22:02,070
retail context of commodity fetishism

565
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:04,650
you correlate your aesthetic taste with

566
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:07,559
material desire whereas in the museum's

567
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:09,450
because you can't buy anything you feel

568
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:11,580
that your aesthetic pleasure is pure

569
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:14,010
that you're simply enjoying out of

570
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:16,710
context objects but of course that's an

571
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:18,870
illusion the museum is the context and

572
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:20,940
the context is telling you that the

573
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:22,620
things you're looking at or art so

574
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:25,320
whoever decides what's in the museum

575
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:27,600
decides what good taste is what's

576
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:29,610
beautiful what's valuable think about

577
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:32,100
the music video for apeshit by the

578
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:34,320
carters the AUSA and jay-z pose in

579
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:36,420
various places in the Louvre conferring

580
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:38,730
upon themselves the status in the

581
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:41,100
cultural grandeur of the art but it's

582
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:42,750
not just a flux it means something more

583
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:44,940
than that because of the racial

584
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:47,160
disparity between the performers and the

585
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:49,200
setting black people and black art are

586
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:51,900
mostly excluded from museums like the

587
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:54,059
Louvre so seeing J&B they're looking so

588
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:56,250
regal with black dancers even

589
00:22:54,059 --> 00:22:59,220
overshadowing canonical European art

590
00:22:56,250 --> 00:23:01,080
it's like a full moment a lot of people

591
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:03,330
have a deep longing for the sensitive

592
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:04,340
dignity and grandeur conferred by

593
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:06,650
classical

594
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:09,140
that's why transwoman love that picture

595
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:10,280
someone photoshopped of the Three Graces

596
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:12,410
but with dicks

597
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:14,390
I'll admit that silly picture actually

598
00:23:12,410 --> 00:23:17,390
had an emotional effect on me because

599
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:19,130
here in the West it's actually hard to

600
00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:20,870
think of your body type as beautiful

601
00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:23,900
until you've seen it sculpted in white

602
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:27,410
marble oh speaking of which white marble

603
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:29,900
is a lie for most of art history history

604
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:32,570
scholars have insisted that the iconic

605
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:34,490
ghostly whiteness of classical statues

606
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:36,950
was the distinguishing feature of

607
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:38,480
Western sculpture proof of the elegant

608
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:40,820
taste of the ancient Greeks and Romans

609
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:42,140
in reality of course it turns out they

610
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:43,910
were painted the colors of something a

611
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:45,680
drag queen might wear to a quinceanera

612
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:47,570
scholars had been noticing paint

613
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:49,550
remnants on these statues for hundreds

614
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:51,590
of years but were totally in denial

615
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:53,900
about it because the pure whiteness of

616
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:55,460
these figures was like a sacred dogma

617
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:57,890
Margaret Talbot in The New Yorker

618
00:23:55,460 --> 00:24:01,070
attributes the dogma in part to a

619
00:23:57,890 --> 00:24:03,830
tendency to equate whiteness with beauty

620
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:08,380
taste and classical ideals anti-sikh

621
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:09,590
color as alien sensual and garish in

622
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:12,140
2008

623
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:14,690
Fabio berry an art historian who is now

624
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:17,030
at Stanford complained that a boldly

625
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:19,460
colored re-creation of a statue of the

626
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:21,980
Emperor Augustus at the Vatican Museum

627
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:25,790
looked like a crossdresser trying to

628
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:28,520
hail a taxi hey how are you and you just

629
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:30,830
know that when the news first broke some

630
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:31,940
horrified wasp classicists turned to a

631
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:37,790
colleague and said Oh

632
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:39,710
Kingsley it looks it looks Mexican in

633
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:41,900
fact for the crime of writing about

634
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:44,540
paint on statues some art historians

635
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:46,640
have been harassed by the all right who

636
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:48,170
don't take kindly to anyone questioning

637
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:51,100
their white supremacist myths about

638
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:54,080
antiquity there's some pretty insidious

639
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:57,110
identitarian prejudices here hiding out

640
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:58,510
under the cloak of taste good taste for

641
00:24:57,110 --> 00:25:01,370
upper and middle cause white people

642
00:24:58,510 --> 00:25:05,300
generally includes a reflexive disdain

643
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:07,580
for anything a little bit too colorful

644
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:08,990
it's these classes that constantly use

645
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:13,070
the words gaudy

646
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:14,830
garish tawdry tacky Joe Weldon author

647
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:18,500
fears the history of leopard-print

648
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:20,360
observed that tacky as a concept refers

649
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:22,730
to the lack of cultivation or the

650
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:24,649
resistance to taste and more often than

651
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:27,200
not refers to tastes that are not

652
00:25:24,649 --> 00:25:29,990
suitably conservative furthermore tacky

653
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:33,380
is likely to be feminine ethnic queer

654
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:36,500
deviant not manly not practical not

655
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:39,470
businesslike not serious aesthetic

656
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:42,409
excess particularly of colors patterns

657
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:45,500
and bling is especially offensive to

658
00:25:42,409 --> 00:25:47,570
conservative wasp taste tacky is often

659
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:50,330
where the imagination runs free where

660
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:50,899
the heart is where the soul is and where

661
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:52,879
the fun is

662
00:25:50,899 --> 00:25:54,919
well that's good news because people

663
00:25:52,879 --> 00:25:56,990
call my aesthetic tacky all the time I

664
00:25:54,919 --> 00:25:58,909
can't imagine why we just got some more

665
00:25:56,990 --> 00:26:01,429
jewels on my - or camp

666
00:25:58,909 --> 00:26:02,690
people call me camp and sometimes they

667
00:26:01,429 --> 00:26:04,909
don't know if I'm being praised or

668
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:07,309
insulted I suppose it depends on what

669
00:26:04,909 --> 00:26:09,769
camp means camp was the theme of this

670
00:26:07,309 --> 00:26:11,809
year's Met Gala and my feed was flooded

671
00:26:09,769 --> 00:26:13,250
with Brooklynite intellectuals competing

672
00:26:11,809 --> 00:26:15,350
to outwit each other with the most

673
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:17,419
erudite definition of what camp really

674
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:19,730
is what I gather is there's a couple

675
00:26:17,419 --> 00:26:22,399
competing definitions the first I'll

676
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:24,830
call coward camp this bratty hipster

677
00:26:22,399 --> 00:26:27,649
notion of having bad taste on purpose I

678
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:30,110
have no respect for this whatsoever this

679
00:26:27,649 --> 00:26:32,419
is nothing but an anxious and defensive

680
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:34,519
refusal to take a risk you think you're

681
00:26:32,419 --> 00:26:37,610
safe from criticism because your look is

682
00:26:34,519 --> 00:26:39,950
bad on purpose sock thought take a stand

683
00:26:37,610 --> 00:26:41,629
you [ __ ] [ __ ] I take a great offense

684
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:44,419
to this as a person whose look is about

685
00:26:41,629 --> 00:26:46,789
on accident and Susan Sontag agrees with

686
00:26:44,419 --> 00:26:49,879
me in notes on Camp she distinguishes

687
00:26:46,789 --> 00:26:53,120
between naive and deliberate camp your

688
00:26:49,879 --> 00:26:55,789
camp is always naive camp which knows

689
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:58,340
itself to be camp or camping is usually

690
00:26:55,789 --> 00:27:01,129
less satisfying some tag defines naive

691
00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:03,470
camp has failed seriousness a grand

692
00:27:01,129 --> 00:27:05,240
artistic vision that gets a little out

693
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:08,960
of control and enters into absurd

694
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:10,759
territory hey how are yo I don't know my

695
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,500
philosophy of style is that people

696
00:27:10,759 --> 00:27:14,269
should wear what looks good to them

697
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:16,730
I was joking earlier when I said my look

698
00:27:14,269 --> 00:27:19,360
is bad on accident I think my aesthetic

699
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:21,520
is good this is what looks good to me

700
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:23,440
well I'm aware other people might judge

701
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:25,900
it by liquid John water is sad about

702
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:28,780
there being good bad taste and bad bad

703
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:31,510
taste one must remember there is such a

704
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:34,690
thing as good bad taste and bad bad

705
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:37,360
taste to understand bad taste one must

706
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:40,300
have very good taste I've wondered for a

707
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:43,330
long time why I'm so attracted to bad

708
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:45,550
taste like I technically have the

709
00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:49,090
education to know better I know about

710
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:51,790
Glenn Gould but I prefer the barrace why

711
00:27:49,090 --> 00:27:54,850
am I so tacky I think it's because I'm a

712
00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:56,980
transsexual which lowers you at least a

713
00:27:54,850 --> 00:27:59,080
class if you were born upper-class and

714
00:27:56,980 --> 00:28:01,030
you're transsexual you're middle class

715
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:02,830
and I'll [ __ ] if you were born middle

716
00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:05,410
class in your transsexual you are now

717
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:07,210
lower class and if you were born lower

718
00:28:05,410 --> 00:28:10,770
class and they're transsexual Oh

719
00:28:07,210 --> 00:28:13,540
Sawadee you'd better start a revolution

720
00:28:10,770 --> 00:28:20,800
Marsha P Johnson hi how are you chicks

721
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:22,810
with bread 5 glamour trance women have a

722
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:24,580
special relationship with glamour at

723
00:28:22,810 --> 00:28:27,160
least those of us who came of age in the

724
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:29,770
1960s and the most basic everyday sense

725
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:32,500
glam is a way of styling yourself it's

726
00:28:29,770 --> 00:28:34,660
luxurious hair it's high drama makeup

727
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:35,260
it's long nails it's a glitter

728
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:37,480
everywhere

729
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:39,010
it's opposing like a fashion model but

730
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:41,020
originally the word glamour comes from

731
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:43,840
the Scottish word grammar II meaning

732
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:46,480
magic or enchantment and glamour still

733
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:48,760
involves a kind of illusion or charm

734
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:50,740
cast on a spectator the connection

735
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:53,560
between glamour and opulence is explored

736
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:55,810
in the 2008 for us a diva mclamb is

737
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:58,150
transgenderism a critique of or

738
00:28:55,810 --> 00:28:59,920
capitulation to opulence driven glamour

739
00:28:58,150 --> 00:29:01,570
models by transgender writer in

740
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:04,900
underground house music producer Terry

741
00:29:01,570 --> 00:29:07,360
templates aka DJ sprinkles sprinkles

742
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:09,940
rides Europe's ruling elite used

743
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:12,370
opulence as an ideological weapon to

744
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:14,560
befuddle the lower classes with glimpses

745
00:29:12,370 --> 00:29:16,630
of heaven on earth our lifestyles so

746
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:19,060
foreign and unattainable that it could

747
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:21,640
only be the result of divination it is

748
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:23,650
this spell of opulence that led to our

749
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:25,920
current definition of glamour which is

750
00:29:23,650 --> 00:29:28,650
more associated with wealth

751
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:30,780
magic sprinkles alludes to an earlier

752
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:33,090
form of glamour or Granberry that was

753
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:35,550
associated with witchcraft paganism and

754
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:38,460
sexual deviancy but in our capitalist

755
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:40,980
society glamour is a spell of opulence

756
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:43,680
conjuring up what is often a fantasy of

757
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:45,540
a lavish life for example a lot of dry

758
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:47,880
Queens practice this sort of illusionism

759
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:50,040
by impersonating celebrities thereby

760
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:52,380
acquiring the glamour of actresses pop

761
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:53,910
stars and models a secondhand sprinkles

762
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:56,310
is bothered by the way this sort of

763
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:58,530
secondhand glamour acquires its power

764
00:29:56,310 --> 00:30:01,530
from unquestioned social hierarchies

765
00:29:58,530 --> 00:30:03,360
glamour is suspect as a critical minded

766
00:30:01,530 --> 00:30:06,120
political forum because it is about

767
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:09,120
social distance not social integration

768
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:11,460
the promise of the pop diva is not the

769
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:13,890
promise of social transformation but

770
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:17,190
individual transformation in which the

771
00:30:13,890 --> 00:30:19,170
exploited becomes the exploiter it is

772
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:22,350
the promise of an individual's class

773
00:30:19,170 --> 00:30:26,100
mobility not social betterment or class

774
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:28,950
critique it is by and large the American

775
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:30,960
Dream now I have to admit this is a

776
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:32,670
version of the American Dream that hits

777
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:34,260
pretty close to home for me the

778
00:30:32,670 --> 00:30:36,720
overarching plot line of my whole entire

779
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:39,060
YouTube gender journey is that I used to

780
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:41,010
be a tragic mess and I'm still a tragic

781
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:43,410
mess but when I started this channel I

782
00:30:41,010 --> 00:30:45,810
was a broke gender dysphoria alcoholic

783
00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:47,640
cross-dressing tragic mass I'd play a

784
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:49,920
clip but honestly those videos are still

785
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:52,470
too painful for me to even glance' and

786
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:54,120
now I mean look at me look how far I've

787
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:55,980
come I look like a moderately talented

788
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:58,140
female impersonator hey how are you

789
00:30:55,980 --> 00:31:00,540
those first several months of transition

790
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:02,310
though they were rough I had a lot of

791
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:04,320
trouble in the beginning I had to get

792
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:06,900
laughed out of restaurants and I was so

793
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:08,900
proud that I wouldn't let anyone see how

794
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:11,300
much that stuff hurt me

795
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:14,450
I would say well [ __ ] them I know I'm

796
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:16,820
great and then I'd go cry my eyes out

797
00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:19,820
alone in my car and I was a youtuber

798
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:22,970
that whole time too which I mean the

799
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:24,860
cyberbullying alone I don't think you

800
00:31:22,970 --> 00:31:26,840
can even imagine the extent of it if you

801
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:28,970
haven't been in that situation you know

802
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:31,490
hundreds of strangers dissecting your

803
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:33,620
voice picking apart your face and body

804
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:35,780
clocking your clothes and makeup digging

805
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:37,580
up your past trying to deduce the nature

806
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:41,360
of your sexual pathology from the shape

807
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:44,000
of your skull a lot of that a lot of its

808
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:46,309
hilarious to me now but there was a time

809
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,830
when it caused a lot of pain but that

810
00:31:46,309 --> 00:31:51,110
pain spurred me to work on my glow up

811
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:53,450
like it was the cure for cancer like my

812
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:54,530
life depended on it which is basically

813
00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:58,340
how it felt

814
00:31:54,530 --> 00:32:01,010
now sometimes my transcritical eyes meet

815
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:03,800
us as one tweeter put it cripplingly

816
00:32:01,010 --> 00:32:05,690
obsessed with passing and passing and

817
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:09,440
day-to-day life was always a goal for me

818
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:11,600
but glam to me is not about passing I

819
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:13,550
think I actually passed better in no

820
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:15,410
makeup than I do an eye shadow out to

821
00:32:13,550 --> 00:32:16,880
here you know assists woman can wear eye

822
00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:18,620
shadow out to here and people think

823
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:20,630
she's just really into makeup or

824
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:23,240
Instagram or cosplay or something but

825
00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:26,150
when I do it I think it looks like drag

826
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:30,470
which serves to call more attention to

827
00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:32,690
my situation but on YouTube I mean

828
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:34,940
clearly I don't try to pass as a normal

829
00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:36,679
woman everyone here knows I'm trans

830
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:38,900
anyway so what's the point I would

831
00:32:36,679 --> 00:32:41,570
describe this presentation as female

832
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:45,140
impersonator and that's basically what I

833
00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:47,300
am a female female impersonator and I

834
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:49,370
present this way because it's fun I find

835
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:50,990
it artistically fulfilling and let's be

836
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:52,700
honest there's a part of me that always

837
00:32:50,990 --> 00:32:53,750
wanted to be that kind of

838
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:55,640
larger-than-life

839
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:57,080
super woman but I'm also creating

840
00:32:55,640 --> 00:33:00,110
special effects for the camera a

841
00:32:57,080 --> 00:33:02,840
sprinkle says drama offers a strange

842
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:04,880
over performance of gender signifiers a

843
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:07,370
tenuously woven layer of super

844
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:09,770
femininity which is so distracting that

845
00:33:07,370 --> 00:33:12,890
it successfully hides the transgendered

846
00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:15,380
body beneath now a lot of leftists trans

847
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:17,010
people have grown disillusioned with the

848
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:19,320
individual class mobile

849
00:33:17,010 --> 00:33:21,870
be represented by glamour as well as by

850
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:24,180
transition glow-up narratives and I

851
00:33:21,870 --> 00:33:26,640
think that disillusionment in a growing

852
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:28,980
revolutionary sentiment or at the heart

853
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:31,080
of this intensive anger and resentment

854
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:33,810
I've noticed a lot of trans women have

855
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:36,870
for drag queens for glamorous trans

856
00:33:33,810 --> 00:33:37,860
Instagram models and let's be honest for

857
00:33:36,870 --> 00:33:40,260
me

858
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:43,170
here's sprinkles one more time as long

859
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:45,240
as an MTF public acceptance is gauged by

860
00:33:43,170 --> 00:33:47,310
her ability to emulate glamorous body

861
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:49,890
and style requirements that elude most

862
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:52,050
quote real women then I'll have to ask

863
00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:55,140
you to pardon this transgendered writer

864
00:33:52,050 --> 00:33:57,230
phone are feeling represented by RuPaul

865
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:59,850
any more than my mother feels

866
00:33:57,230 --> 00:34:02,160
represented by Marilyn Monroe or

867
00:33:59,850 --> 00:34:04,320
princess time a lot of trans women are

868
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:06,510
basically fed up with having to serve

869
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:08,130
the world a fantasy all the time they

870
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:10,290
want to be seen for who they are without

871
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:11,760
doing any of that [ __ ] they're fed up

872
00:34:10,290 --> 00:34:14,389
with glamour they're set up with

873
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:17,880
realness they're fed up with RuPaul and

874
00:34:14,389 --> 00:34:19,700
a lot of them are pretty fed up with me

875
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:21,360
and I you've been i you've been i you

876
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:24,000
6mv

877
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:26,610
the marxist art critic John Berger

878
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:29,669
called glamour the happiness of being

879
00:34:26,610 --> 00:34:30,540
envied being envied is a solitary form

880
00:34:29,669 --> 00:34:33,450
of reassurance

881
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:35,399
it depends precisely upon or not sharing

882
00:34:33,450 --> 00:34:37,110
your experiences with those who envy you

883
00:34:35,399 --> 00:34:39,480
but being interviewed as a form of

884
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:41,610
happiness only in the imagination the

885
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:44,850
actual experience of being unbeatable

886
00:34:41,610 --> 00:34:47,250
socks this is the risk of opulence it

887
00:34:44,850 --> 00:34:50,669
invites not just enchanted admiration

888
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:53,129
but also an theme and where envy goes if

889
00:34:50,669 --> 00:34:55,290
a guillotine follows for at least a

890
00:34:53,129 --> 00:34:57,930
vindictive taxation this is why the

891
00:34:55,290 --> 00:34:59,820
experience rich new to tone down the

892
00:34:57,930 --> 00:35:01,350
opulence build a nice high wall around

893
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:03,960
their properties and make a lot of

894
00:35:01,350 --> 00:35:05,700
high-profile charitable donations we can

895
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:08,130
call this kind of strategizing the

896
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:09,980
public relations of success it certainly

897
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:11,850
helps a barracks to riches story

898
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:13,910
especially if you can make other people

899
00:35:11,850 --> 00:35:16,220
feel included in some way

900
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:18,350
success that's part of the appeal of

901
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:20,780
hip-hop opulence is that it seems to

902
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:22,460
elevate not just a single performer but

903
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:24,710
an entire underclass

904
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:27,530
conversely being perceived as

905
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:29,750
exclusionary elitist or snobbish is

906
00:35:27,530 --> 00:35:32,120
gonna cost you big in terms of envy

907
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:34,070
management YouTube music critic taught

908
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:36,230
in the shadows did a review of ariana

909
00:35:34,070 --> 00:35:38,660
grande's song seven rings in which he

910
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:40,490
basically drags ariana who apparently is

911
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:42,290
white for appropriating a bunch of

912
00:35:40,490 --> 00:35:44,330
hip-hop rights to rigid signifiers

913
00:35:42,290 --> 00:35:46,520
without any of the subtext of starting

914
00:35:44,330 --> 00:35:49,520
from the bottom she's not showcasing a

915
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:51,800
triumph over adversity she's just a

916
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:53,740
white girl who likes stuff we started

917
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:56,750
from the bottom now the whole team

918
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:58,940
[ __ ] here so in Todd's words the song

919
00:35:56,750 --> 00:36:01,700
is a grotesque bullying of VIP only

920
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:03,800
privileged flex of a mean girl shoving

921
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:06,320
her wealth in your face I actually like

922
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:08,200
that song but I'm into that sort of

923
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:11,270
thing believe me Mommy Oh

924
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:13,280
fellow students as a case study in the

925
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:15,440
public relations of success and envy

926
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:18,560
management let us compare and contrast

927
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:20,690
two successful youtubers Jeffrey star

928
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:22,220
and Gigi gorgeous there's enough

929
00:36:20,690 --> 00:36:24,110
similarities between them for the

930
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:26,480
differences to be interesting to both

931
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:28,460
LGB and orti they're both white

932
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:31,040
they're both blonde sometimes they're

933
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:33,410
both feminine they're both rich and they

934
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:35,720
both flaunt their opulent lifestyles the

935
00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:39,680
nonetheless people basically seem to

936
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:41,870
like jeffrey star whereas GG well i

937
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:44,450
don't want to say people don't like her

938
00:36:41,870 --> 00:36:47,480
but they don't relate to her the best

939
00:36:44,450 --> 00:36:49,610
example of this is her 2017 video I wear

940
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:52,460
Walmart for a week with its gasp

941
00:36:49,610 --> 00:36:55,040
inducing life to dislike ratio let's

942
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:57,350
analyze what went wrong so for today's

943
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:58,430
video I thought we would take it to a

944
00:36:57,350 --> 00:37:01,400
place I've never been

945
00:36:58,430 --> 00:37:03,560
Walmart so that's a bad start Gorge most

946
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:05,450
Americans have been to Walmart never

947
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:08,150
having been marks your upbringing as

948
00:37:05,450 --> 00:37:09,620
upper middle class at least treating

949
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:11,870
going to Walmart as some kind of

950
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:13,790
challenge kind of comes across as you

951
00:37:11,870 --> 00:37:16,400
and your rich friends being like what if

952
00:37:13,790 --> 00:37:17,750
we pretend to be poor for a day I wonder

953
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,380
if we're gonna see any people at Walmart

954
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:23,000
you know that what

955
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:24,290
babies crying the trauma Gigi no you

956
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:27,140
need to turn the shame down like it's

957
00:37:24,290 --> 00:37:28,670
like 20 notches Gorge I keep taking my

958
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:31,490
shin on this cart I'm literally gonna

959
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:32,480
have bruises and someone remake these

960
00:37:31,490 --> 00:37:35,240
carts please

961
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:37,320
dangerous they're gonna cut your head

962
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:40,449
off Gorge

963
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:40,449
[Music]

964
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:45,590
what should we get snacks maybe like a

965
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:46,010
gown for a red carpet do they sell gowns

966
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:49,250
here

967
00:37:46,010 --> 00:37:51,440
this to me is peek GG strolling down the

968
00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:53,450
aisles of Walmart with a 2-liter bottle

969
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:55,760
of Mountain Dew that you pull up from

970
00:37:53,450 --> 00:37:57,890
the shelves saying I need something for

971
00:37:55,760 --> 00:38:01,400
a red carpet do they have gowns here

972
00:37:57,890 --> 00:38:03,770
this to me is an iconic fashion moment

973
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:05,810
this is naive camp this is everything

974
00:38:03,770 --> 00:38:07,070
the idea that she has privileges that

975
00:38:05,810 --> 00:38:09,680
other people don't

976
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:12,590
has never once crossed her mind and that

977
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:14,630
is a very special precious thing that I

978
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:16,250
want to cherish personally I have no

979
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:18,530
choice but to stay on the youtube

980
00:38:16,250 --> 00:38:21,980
comments section however is not as

981
00:38:18,530 --> 00:38:23,570
amused as I am nor as forgiving this is

982
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:25,820
a second time I've done a close reading

983
00:38:23,570 --> 00:38:27,830
of a GG video it's getting kind of weird

984
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:30,170
also why hasn't she answered my letters

985
00:38:27,830 --> 00:38:32,210
step on my throat mommy and let's look

986
00:38:30,170 --> 00:38:34,400
at Jeffrey star Jeffrey did similar

987
00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:36,170
kinds of videos to Gigi he's even done

988
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:38,540
his own video wearing Walmart for a day

989
00:38:36,170 --> 00:38:40,010
which people loved and my first impulse

990
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:42,440
when explaining the differences in

991
00:38:40,010 --> 00:38:43,880
public perception it's a scream thanks

992
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:46,430
is that my and there's maybe a little

993
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:48,170
like going on I do think a rich woman is

994
00:38:46,430 --> 00:38:49,970
more irritating to people than a rich

995
00:38:48,170 --> 00:38:50,840
man but there's clearly more than that

996
00:38:49,970 --> 00:38:53,300
going on here

997
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:56,390
Jeffrey's fans are I assume mostly women

998
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:57,980
and not rich women regular women the

999
00:38:56,390 --> 00:38:59,900
women who work as a dollar store love

1000
00:38:57,980 --> 00:39:02,000
them I'm your biggest fan

1001
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:03,890
ordinary people actually enjoy watching

1002
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,660
Jeffrey's plot as millions of dollars of

1003
00:39:03,890 --> 00:39:07,700
designer bags and clothes because they

1004
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:09,680
either live vicariously through him or

1005
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:11,480
they see him as aspirational it's the

1006
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:13,790
same reason why poor people have always

1007
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:15,950
enjoyed watching reality TV shows about

1008
00:39:13,790 --> 00:39:17,840
the extremely wealthy the centerpiece of

1009
00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:20,240
Jeffrey stars brand is that he's

1010
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:22,280
self-made he represents himself as

1011
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:23,390
having started from the bottom you know

1012
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:26,390
he talks about his white-trash

1013
00:39:23,390 --> 00:39:27,920
upbringing and just generally seems like

1014
00:39:26,390 --> 00:39:29,900
he hasn't let his wealth go to his head

1015
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:32,360
a good example of this is his private

1016
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:33,890
jet Burger King Luke bomb now at first

1017
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:36,050
you might think that a private jet is

1018
00:39:33,890 --> 00:39:38,510
not very relatable but the Burger King

1019
00:39:36,050 --> 00:39:40,820
aspect brings it back down to earth

1020
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:43,070
Jeffery seems like he's been to Burger

1021
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:44,990
King before he's able to order fluently

1022
00:39:43,070 --> 00:39:46,309
he's even kind of charming to the

1023
00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:49,339
cashier he doesn't

1024
00:39:46,309 --> 00:39:53,630
scoff or pinches nose at anything also

1025
00:39:49,339 --> 00:39:56,170
the Gucci Bharat wear as Gigi I mean

1026
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:58,189
don't get me wrong I do love Gigi but I

1027
00:39:56,170 --> 00:40:00,499
don't know if sis would make it out of

1028
00:39:58,189 --> 00:40:02,869
Burger King alive you know she'd commit

1029
00:40:00,499 --> 00:40:05,449
some terrible upper-class solecism like

1030
00:40:02,869 --> 00:40:07,099
I don't know not understanding the

1031
00:40:05,449 --> 00:40:08,569
concept of a value meal

1032
00:40:07,099 --> 00:40:11,989
I'm sure Gigi would make an entertaining

1033
00:40:08,569 --> 00:40:13,849
video just not a relatable video you

1034
00:40:11,989 --> 00:40:15,559
know or she'd somehow contract syphilis

1035
00:40:13,849 --> 00:40:17,209
from the toilet seat and do a story talk

1036
00:40:15,559 --> 00:40:19,039
about that that's really when Gigi's at

1037
00:40:17,209 --> 00:40:20,749
her best she kind of comes back down to

1038
00:40:19,039 --> 00:40:22,549
earth whenever she's serving the real

1039
00:40:20,749 --> 00:40:25,670
transsexual Housewives of Beverly Hills

1040
00:40:22,549 --> 00:40:27,410
needs David Cronenberg so I'm like but I

1041
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:29,329
see this white little Chiclets in my

1042
00:40:27,410 --> 00:40:32,479
hand I'm feeling with my tongue and I'm

1043
00:40:29,329 --> 00:40:34,339
like oh my god economic inequality in

1044
00:40:32,479 --> 00:40:37,160
this country has always been enabled by

1045
00:40:34,339 --> 00:40:37,789
the fact that people basically like the

1046
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:39,259
rich

1047
00:40:37,789 --> 00:40:41,089
yeah we judge people who live in

1048
00:40:39,259 --> 00:40:43,519
McMansions and we get irritated by

1049
00:40:41,089 --> 00:40:46,400
elitist out-of-touch behavior but

1050
00:40:43,519 --> 00:40:48,079
ultimately we have no choice but to

1051
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,699
stand and the people we stand the

1052
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:52,819
hardest are people like Jeffries Starr

1053
00:40:49,699 --> 00:40:55,939
who in a way seems like a poor person

1054
00:40:52,819 --> 00:40:57,739
who just so happens to be very rich now

1055
00:40:55,939 --> 00:40:59,989
if any quality increases enough I

1056
00:40:57,739 --> 00:41:01,789
suspect the standing will stop because

1057
00:40:59,989 --> 00:41:03,469
it's [ __ ] I watched jeffree star spend

1058
00:41:01,789 --> 00:41:05,239
sixty nine thousand dollars in one trip

1059
00:41:03,469 --> 00:41:06,949
to the Louie Vuitton store if what

1060
00:41:05,239 --> 00:41:08,959
you're doing is fantasizing about what

1061
00:41:06,949 --> 00:41:10,459
you would buy with that much money but

1062
00:41:08,959 --> 00:41:11,959
if you're thinking about how sixty nine

1063
00:41:10,459 --> 00:41:14,089
thousand dollars can pay off your life

1064
00:41:11,959 --> 00:41:15,890
groaning medical debt or about how you'd

1065
00:41:14,089 --> 00:41:18,289
be able to afford cancer treatments for

1066
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:19,729
your dying wife this kind of thing will

1067
00:41:18,289 --> 00:41:22,429
start getting under your skin

1068
00:41:19,729 --> 00:41:24,799
and eventually people will start

1069
00:41:22,429 --> 00:41:26,539
building guillotines again in fact the

1070
00:41:24,799 --> 00:41:28,670
only way I can imagine a revolution

1071
00:41:26,539 --> 00:41:30,499
happening in this country is if rich

1072
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:33,580
people start behaving as badly as

1073
00:41:30,499 --> 00:41:35,890
possible this isn't your dream job

1074
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:37,230
and this is free right whatever okay

1075
00:41:35,890 --> 00:41:40,570
great

1076
00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:42,349
seven ruin

1077
00:41:40,570 --> 00:41:46,189
[Music]

1078
00:41:42,349 --> 00:41:49,609
good evening gorge ever notice how most

1079
00:41:46,189 --> 00:41:52,669
vampires are like cows or Queens or

1080
00:41:49,609 --> 00:41:55,429
ELISA rich I guess some are edgy biker

1081
00:41:52,669 --> 00:41:56,269
teens but I don't associate without

1082
00:41:55,429 --> 00:41:58,160
trash

1083
00:41:56,269 --> 00:42:00,919
gothic horror really got started as a

1084
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:02,779
genre with 18th and 19th century novels

1085
00:42:00,919 --> 00:42:05,299
which were usually set in an old

1086
00:42:02,779 --> 00:42:07,400
decaying castle or mansion but the late

1087
00:42:05,299 --> 00:42:09,259
19th century the earth stock recei had

1088
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:11,809
lost a lot of its relevance as a class

1089
00:42:09,259 --> 00:42:14,569
so aristocratic vampires like Count

1090
00:42:11,809 --> 00:42:17,299
Dracula represented a dying world order

1091
00:42:14,569 --> 00:42:19,249
and also maybe the metaphorical blood

1092
00:42:17,299 --> 00:42:21,169
sucking of cava nur's by the landed

1093
00:42:19,249 --> 00:42:24,169
gentry vampires were also usually

1094
00:42:21,169 --> 00:42:26,179
seducers and the aristocrats seducer

1095
00:42:24,169 --> 00:42:28,279
trope had actually played an important

1096
00:42:26,179 --> 00:42:30,739
role in turning public opinion against

1097
00:42:28,279 --> 00:42:32,959
the nobility said the gothic aesthetic

1098
00:42:30,739 --> 00:42:35,509
is an aesthetic of dead and decaying

1099
00:42:32,959 --> 00:42:37,369
opulence and that aesthetic has evolved

1100
00:42:35,509 --> 00:42:40,549
over time from the ruins of a medieval

1101
00:42:37,369 --> 00:42:43,130
castle to the iconic haunted house which

1102
00:42:40,549 --> 00:42:44,749
an American horror is usually a decaying

1103
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:46,549
Victorian mansion

1104
00:42:44,749 --> 00:42:48,669
it's a trope with an interesting back

1105
00:42:46,549 --> 00:42:50,719
story during the Gilded Age

1106
00:42:48,669 --> 00:42:52,729
industrialization produced a new wealthy

1107
00:42:50,719 --> 00:42:55,219
class of people who built what were

1108
00:42:52,729 --> 00:42:57,259
essentially 19th century McMansions

1109
00:42:55,219 --> 00:42:59,269
when the Great Depression hit a lot of

1110
00:42:57,259 --> 00:43:01,819
these Victorian mansions were abandoned

1111
00:42:59,269 --> 00:43:03,829
and began to decay which gave them

1112
00:43:01,819 --> 00:43:06,619
morbid associations that made them

1113
00:43:03,829 --> 00:43:10,669
perfect for stories about hauntings and

1114
00:43:06,619 --> 00:43:13,489
psychos weirdos some ruined opulence

1115
00:43:10,669 --> 00:43:16,759
becomes gothic which kind of makes you

1116
00:43:13,489 --> 00:43:19,069
think we live in an age of opulence and

1117
00:43:16,759 --> 00:43:21,319
inequality and growing irritation with

1118
00:43:19,069 --> 00:43:23,719
abusive men in power the middle class is

1119
00:43:21,319 --> 00:43:26,779
shrinking social unrest is on the rise

1120
00:43:23,719 --> 00:43:29,209
it seems like a new economic order could

1121
00:43:26,779 --> 00:43:31,609
be on the horizon when the opulence of

1122
00:43:29,209 --> 00:43:34,009
our age decays will there be a new

1123
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:37,189
gothic aesthetic of ruined shopping

1124
00:43:34,009 --> 00:43:40,339
malls well they're kind of already is

1125
00:43:37,189 --> 00:43:42,650
the urban explorer Danville is a YouTube

1126
00:43:40,339 --> 00:43:44,569
bird known for his dead Maul series in

1127
00:43:42,650 --> 00:43:46,699
which he explores the ruins of abandoned

1128
00:43:44,569 --> 00:43:48,919
shopping malls for example the now

1129
00:43:46,699 --> 00:43:52,069
demolished Owings Mills Mall just north

1130
00:43:48,919 --> 00:43:53,210
of Baltimore the mall opened in 1986 as

1131
00:43:52,069 --> 00:43:56,420
the Owings Mills

1132
00:43:53,210 --> 00:43:59,030
and more champagne Goldust and pink

1133
00:43:56,420 --> 00:44:01,280
feathers heralds within a new era for

1134
00:43:59,030 --> 00:44:03,290
always metals today's opening of the

1135
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:05,750
Owings Mills fashion law does not only

1136
00:44:03,290 --> 00:44:07,640
mean a new high fashion place to shop it

1137
00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:09,740
also means lots of new developments and

1138
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:12,080
jobs for Baltimore County it had a

1139
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:15,230
Macy's a Lord and Taylor a Saks Fifth

1140
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:18,260
Avenue it was a big high-end mall but in

1141
00:44:15,230 --> 00:44:20,480
1992 a woman who worked as a cleaner at

1142
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:22,130
Saks was murdered during an armed

1143
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:24,350
robbery on the trail between the mall

1144
00:44:22,130 --> 00:44:26,540
and the Baltimore metro station after

1145
00:44:24,350 --> 00:44:28,970
the murder the mall got a reputation for

1146
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:31,760
being unsafe and slowly the stores

1147
00:44:28,970 --> 00:44:34,760
closed down dan recorded two videos at

1148
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:38,240
Owings Mills in 2015 but only five of

1149
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:40,190
the original 155 stores remained he

1150
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:42,940
takes us through this strangely clean

1151
00:44:40,190 --> 00:44:46,460
and empty halls the drained fountains

1152
00:44:42,940 --> 00:44:48,470
the gutted food court watching these

1153
00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:51,440
videos seems to provoke an emotional

1154
00:44:48,470 --> 00:44:54,260
response and a lot of people some say

1155
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:56,990
they feel nostalgic or sad some express

1156
00:44:54,260 --> 00:44:59,900
rage of the waste and futility some find

1157
00:44:56,990 --> 00:45:01,490
it creepy or even horrifying and some

1158
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:03,950
have a dark sense of humor about the

1159
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:05,600
absurdity of it all one commenter says I

1160
00:45:03,950 --> 00:45:08,870
think it is still hitting people with

1161
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:12,170
slow motion shock that the 20th century

1162
00:45:08,870 --> 00:45:14,180
is really over in the 80s this looked

1163
00:45:12,170 --> 00:45:17,390
like the start of a big new world of

1164
00:45:14,180 --> 00:45:19,910
wealth for everyone in fact it was the

1165
00:45:17,390 --> 00:45:23,540
last gasp of 20th century general

1166
00:45:19,910 --> 00:45:26,000
prosperity I agree with all these

1167
00:45:23,540 --> 00:45:28,430
comments and I feel every one of these

1168
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:31,130
emotions I think there is a new

1169
00:45:28,430 --> 00:45:34,040
aesthetic sensibility emerging here a

1170
00:45:31,130 --> 00:45:37,130
gothic aesthetic for the 21st century

1171
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:39,590
this decaying opulence that is the

1172
00:45:37,130 --> 00:45:42,980
carcass of twentieth-century consumerism

1173
00:45:39,590 --> 00:45:45,800
oh it gives me a chill my nave hair

1174
00:45:42,980 --> 00:45:48,280
stands on end and a tingle goes down my

1175
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:48,280
spine

1176
00:45:48,810 --> 00:45:54,210
the owings mills mall was totally

1177
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:56,370
demolished in late 2016 and dance final

1178
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:58,470
video about it we see clips from his

1179
00:45:56,370 --> 00:46:01,350
earlier Owings Mills videos intercut

1180
00:45:58,470 --> 00:46:04,620
with absolutely post-apocalyptic footage

1181
00:46:01,350 --> 00:46:06,780
of the half demolished ruin it's not

1182
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:09,180
like the feeling of exploring a ruined

1183
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:11,640
temple or Abbey where you somehow

1184
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:14,580
perceive the spiritual significance in

1185
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:17,070
the original building in a dead mall you

1186
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:19,440
do sense the ghosts of the shoppers and

1187
00:46:17,070 --> 00:46:22,470
the workers their aspirations and

1188
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:24,960
material longings but what does the

1189
00:46:22,470 --> 00:46:28,770
crumbling wreckage of a JC Penney really

1190
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:37,110
mean that is a question that will haunt

1191
00:46:28,770 --> 00:46:39,270
me to the grave alright comrades I've

1192
00:46:37,110 --> 00:46:41,820

unless you're into that

1195
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:51,830
