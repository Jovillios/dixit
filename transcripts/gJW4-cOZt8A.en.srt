1
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:06,879
when you look into the pools of the 911

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:09,519
memorial at the world trade center

3
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:10,320
you start to ask yourself questions why

4
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:14,000
is the world

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:17,520
bad what did all these people die for

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,240
well for freedom i guess and like

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,039
american values but what are those

8
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:24,720
values

9
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:26,880
what kind of freedom is it that we have

10
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,560
the 911 memorial shares the world trade

11
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,000
center site with the largest shopping

12
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,640
mall in manhattan

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,600
there's a forever 21 an under armour a

00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,600
and a pair of shoes that i want but

16
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,280
they're too expensive and my feet are

17
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,160
too big and i'm too tall to wear high

18
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:45,840
heels anyway

19
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:45,840
ah [ __ ] neoliberalism

20
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,360
what even goes on in these big buildings

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,280
i've been looking at them all my life

22
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,960
but i've never been inside one

23
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,640
are these the towers where the ruling

24
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,199
lizards gather

25
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:02,480
drinking human blood licking whipped

cream off the interns

27
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:07,360
what the hell even is this country just

28
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,520
the same terrible [ __ ]

00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:11,200

34
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:27,520
i guess it's not so bad as long as you

35
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:29,360
kick things up a notch

36
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:31,040
yes i want to add the lava cakes to my

37
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,250
order dominoes of course i want the

38
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,560
[ __ ] lava cakes

39
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:37,040
[Music]

40
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,000
i'm gonna put the cake on the pizza put

41
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:41,600
it all in me

42
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,640
fill me up

43
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:48,320
oh god damn it it was so good but i ate

44
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:51,439
so much i think i'm gonna die look what

45
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:55,520
capitalism made me do

46
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:59,439
of vast parts of territory all across

47
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:01,040
the middle east political dissent

48
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:03,119
begins with the vegas feeling that

49
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,799
something is wrong and a lot of people

50
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:06,560
have that feeling but the problem with

51
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,680
vague feelings is they can be channeled

52
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,759
in any direction

53
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,840
the same vague angst can drive people to

54
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:12,319
communism or fascism or anything in

55
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,920
between

56
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:16,160
there's a general sense today among

57
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,160
young people that we have been lied to

58
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,000
and that sense is perhaps the most acute

59
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,840
among middle class white men

60
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,040
who apparently were promised that they

61
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,000
could be millionaires

62
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,560
or movie gods or rock stars the term

63
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,560
special

64
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,160
snowflake is used today as a slur

65
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,160
against queer teenagers

66
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:34,080
but it comes from the movie fight club

67
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,680
where it refers to a generation of white

68
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,360
guys who have become adults

69
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,040
only to find that they're worse off than

70
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,160
their fathers that they don't have

71
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,160
glamorous jobs

72
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,319
they don't have girlfriends and more

73
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,760
recently that even in the escapist world

74
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:48,879
of video games their absolute

75
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:50,480
sovereignty is being challenged

76
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:52,560
i've devoted half my channel to

77
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,959
chronicling the deranged consequences of

78
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,280
this situation

79
00:02:53,959 --> 00:02:59,599
anti-feminism alpha males pickup artists

80
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,800
the surreal surge in support for a white

81
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:02,640
ethnic homeland

82
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,800
but till now i haven't talked about the

83
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,440
underlying causes and it's important to

84
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,519
do that

85
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,720
because the thing is the white men

86
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:10,800
aren't even wrong

87
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,480
that society is screwing them in some

88
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,360
way it's just that it's screwing

89
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,760
everyone else

90
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:18,159
even more so the masculinist alt-right

91
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,720
analysis of society is exactly upside

92
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:20,560
down

93
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,400
guys you are not under the thumb of a

94
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,840
jewish feminist plot to turn you into

95
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,920
girly soyboy [ __ ]

96
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,760
cultural marxism did not turn you into

97
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:30,159
placid ikea consumers

98
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:32,000
capitalism did so what you need to do is

99
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:34,080
stop scapegoating non-whites

100
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,760
feminists and trans people and unite

101
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,280
with the rest of us to actually do

102
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:47,840
something about the real enemy

103
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:47,840
the blood-sucking god damn reptiles

104
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:54,400
chapter one capitalism and spirit oh god

105
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:54,720
i sound like a philosopher someone shoot

106
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,720
me

107
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,319
remember that nazi propaganda video

108
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:01,519
where richard spencer says that a

109
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:02,400
nation based on freedom is just another

110
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:04,480
place to go

111
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,720
shopping a leftist could easily have

112
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,239
said that we think of leftist analysis

113
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,920
as being very materialistic

114
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:12,080
but there's a spiritual dimension to it

115
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,519
too much of karl marx's early writings

116
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,439
are primarily concerned with the state

117
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,040
of the human soul under capitalism with

118
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:18,479
the alien nation of working not for

119
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,239
yourself but for an employer who

120
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:21,840
appropriates the value of your work with

121
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:23,759
the fetishism of commodities

122
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:25,360
the investment of inanimate objects with

123
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,240
transcendent properties beyond their

124
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,160
usefulness

125
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,600
with a system of lies and delusions by

126
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,720
which capitalism understands and

127
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,880
justifies itself

128
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,520
with [ __ ] comcast increasing my bill

129
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:37,680
to 70 a month for no [ __ ] reason no

130
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,360
i don't want a landline no one under the

131
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,960
age of 60 wants a landlord of course

132
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,720
it's not just marxists who complain

133
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,960
about a capitalist malaise

134
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,960
fascists and conservatives notice it too

135
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,960
only they think the solution is to seek

136
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,080
collective meaning in ancient customs

137
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,000
racial chauvinism

138
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,360
or fight clubs and that shit's not

139
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,120
really my scene i'm

140
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,800
really more of a pursuit of individual

141
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,040
happiness person but

142
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,800
i think that capitalism as we know it is

143
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,600
pretty bad at fostering individual

144
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:05,039
happiness

145
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,560
and here's why chapter 2 alienated labor

146
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:08,639
ah this marxist jargon

147
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,759
sucks let's come up with something new

148
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,880
chapter 2

149
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:14,639
shitty jobs why is your job so shitty

150
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,960
well probably it's because you work at

151
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:18,400
the comcast customer service call center

152
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,320
and you spend your day dealing with

153
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,600
whiny and titled white [ __ ] who don't

154
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,960
understand that you're just a lackey

155
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,479
without any actual power

156
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,000
and the system is organized so that

157
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:27,600
people with no power just have to

158
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,120
pointlessly shout at each other you

159
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,479
don't have any stake in the profit of

160
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,160
comcast as a company

161
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:33,680
so you don't really have any reason to

162
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,280
give a [ __ ] about the success of the

163
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,680
corporate machine in which you are a

164
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,240
gear

165
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,600
the ceo makes 36 million dollars a year

166
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,360
while you make 14

167
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,120
an hour which means that a lot of the

168
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,160
value of the work you're doing doesn't

169
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,600
get paid to you

170
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,440
but goes straight up the chain of

171
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,400
command and into the pockets of the

172
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,080
chief lizards

173
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,680
the ruthless hierarchical structure of

174
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,000
the company means that you're competing

175
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,320
against

176
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,759
your fellow employees for a promotion or

177
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,120
even to not be laid off

178
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:58,880
and if that happens you'll end up

179
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,919
competing against other unemployed

180
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,720
people for another

181
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:03,360
shitty job as a concrete lifter or a mud

182
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,080
mule

183
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,639
or maybe even a coffee shop macbook

184
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,160
person

185
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:10,000
this means it's difficult to even

186
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,680
experience companionship with the other

187
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,199
people in your shitty situation

188
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,120
because you're all being pitted against

189
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:17,120
each other by the goddamn reptiles

190
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,680
and it gets even worse you could be

191
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,800
employed by new age reptiles who force

192
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,880
you to participate in

193
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,160
team building exercises company

194
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,479
scavenger hunts

195
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,400
mandatory fun which means that not only

196
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:29,759
do you have a shitty oppressive job but

197
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,520
you're not even allowed the basic

198
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:33,120
pleasure of openly hating your life

199
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,120
you have to constantly pretend that

200
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,800
you're having fun all for the sake of

201
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,800
maintaining the overlord's comfortable

202
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,560
delusion that he's not your overlord

203
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,080
these lizards are smart and they keep

204
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,639
coming up with more elaborate ways to

205
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,479
lie to you

206
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:46,000
if you work for uber they won't even be

207
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,800
honest about the fact that you're their

208
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,520
employee

209
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:53,120
they'll call you an independent

210
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:54,400
contractor you get to be your own boss

211
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,080
and set your own hours

212
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,440
you only have to take out the initial

213
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,440
loan buy the car

214
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:02,080
pay the insurance pay for the cleaning

215
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,599
take on all the risk and give uber 25

216
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,759
without getting a guaranteed wage

217
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:07,120
benefits paid leave or pension

218
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,039
so much better than being an

219
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,560
old-fashioned employee right

220
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:11,840
now please don't transfer me to the

221
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,840
billing department they already

222
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:16,080
transferred me here chapter 3

223
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,840
advertising is it pretentious to use

224
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,680
chapters in a youtube video

225
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:21,360
what if each section is named after an

226
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,560
episode in the odyssey if you've lived

227
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,240
your life in america

228
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,400
you've spent every day since birth has

229
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,919
sailed from all directions by propaganda

230
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:31,039
campaigns for cereals

231
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:33,440
and cigarettes and sugar snacks

232
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:34,080
and now you can't get no satisfaction

233
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,280
jesus

234
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,199
people have been complaining about

235
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,639
advertising so long it's come to seem

236
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,639
like a basic feature of the human

237
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:41,840
condition but it's not a basic feature

238
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:43,680
of the human condition

239
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:45,759
it's a situation particular to life

240
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,039
under capitalism i mean north korea is a

241
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:48,560
dystopian [ __ ]

242
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:50,639
but at least the train station isn't

243
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:54,639
cluttered up with advertisements for

244
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:55,759
oh so many fans counterpoints is a tanki

245
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:58,080
confirmed

246
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:58,879
a near-liberal tanki the purpose of

247
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,199
advertising

248
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:03,360
is to manufacture desires which brands

249
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:05,039
across the world spend nearly 500

250
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,039
billion dollars a year doing the

251
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,919
ubiquity and apparent effectiveness of

252
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:09,199
advertising

253
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:11,039
seems to contradict one of the

254
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:12,479
fundamental assumptions of capitalist

255
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:14,240
society namely

256
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:16,160
that we're all autonomous individuals

257
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,080
making rational choices in pursuit of

258
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,919
our own well-being advertising uses a

259
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,319
lot of rhetorical strategies that are

260
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:22,720
not

261
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:24,319
very rational for instance randomly

262
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,240
correlating the product with sexual

263
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,599
desire generating new insecurities the

264
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,199
product promises to alleviate

265
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:31,039
associating the product with social

266
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:32,640
status associating the product with

267
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:33,120
random famous people associating the

268
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,039
product

269
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,479
with degenerate decadent associating the

270
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:38,080
product with progressive social

271
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:39,839
movements associating the product

272
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,680
with communist revolution gazing

273
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:42,719
longingly a dreamy argentinian

274
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:45,600
philosophy professor

275
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:47,040
join the clone army completely original

276
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:50,160
lighting gay orgies

277
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:51,200
love cannot survive without diamonds is

278
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,640
this rational

279
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,640
does it help people make genuine

280
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:56,720
decisions about their own best interests

281
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:58,640
of course not the goal of advertising is

282
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,680
not to satisfy the pre-existing needs

283
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:02,000
that people have

284
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:03,600
it's to endlessly create new needs and

285
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,440
that's a lot to keep up with and it

286
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:08,240
takes a lot of stamina which is why it's

287
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:10,000
a good thing i discovered vitalimax plus

288
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,839
every evening before i start writing or

289
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,080
shooting a video i insert two

290
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:16,000
vitalimax plus suppositories for a

291
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,839
sustainable blast in power

292
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,160
with all natural ginseng and opium

293
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:21,360
extracts vitalimax plus gives me the

294
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,360
reckless euphoria

295
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,720
and indifference to pain that i need to

296
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,680
get it

297
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:29,600
in i start with a couple dozen oysters

298
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,160
eat some molly maybe hit a couple

299
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,160
animals

300
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,519
then i take my vitalimax plus and i'm

301
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:36,560
ready to rip

302
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:39,600
it by talamax

303
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:41,839
for bottoms consumer society is all

304
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,360
about goddamn lizards inventing desires

305
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:44,399
which they implant in your brain through

306
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,000
advertising

307
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:48,160
then they sell you the product that

308
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,080
fulfills the desire that they invented

309
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,760
irrespective of whether the fulfillment

310
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,680
of the desire actually contributes to

311
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,680
your well-being in any way so what we

312
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,680
have is a society built not around

313
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,720
meeting basic human needs or maximizing

314
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,640
human happiness

315
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,839
but around the extravagant profits of

316
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,519
powerful reptiles

317
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:05,200
who tell you what to want and then sell

318
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:07,440
it to you and this would be a grim state

319
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,360
of affairs in any circumstances but it's

320
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,279
especially egregious in a country where

321
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,120
many of the basic needs are not met

322
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:14,480
on the one hand we have 40 million

323
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,360
people living in this country with

324
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,440
medical debt

325
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,880
spiraling tuition costs leading college

326
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,839
students to take out loans they may

327
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,760
never escape

328
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:23,600
more than half a million homeless people

329
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,480
and 13 million children who have to go

330
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,640
to school hungry

331
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:29,279
and on the other hand we apparently have

332
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:32,079
the resources to mass produce 400

333
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:33,760
juice packets squeezing machines and 300

334
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:35,360
luxury ice cubes and there were

335
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,760
apparently americans who are willing to

336
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,839
spend

337
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,839
50 million dollars on barnet newman

338
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:41,839
paintings i mean it's a fine painting

339
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,680
it's got a lot of great red on it

340
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:45,600
but is it really worth the cost of

341
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,720
feeding every homeless person in america

342
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,800
for two weeks

343
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:51,200
is this what an efficient economy looks

344
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,000
like if gdp is your only measure of

345
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,839
efficiency

346
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,600
then maybe but shouldn't the economy

347
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:56,079
serve humanity rather than the other way

348
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,760
around

349
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:59,360
if millions of people are struggling

350
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,360
under the weight of student debt

351
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,519
underemployment and outrageous medical

352
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:06,170
costs then who gives a [ __ ] how many

353
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:12,410
golden donuts we can

354
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:12,410
[Music]

355
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,760
what do i do produce the gold on my

356
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:20,079
fingers canto4 message to the rich

357
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,800
all right you filthy goddamn reptiles

358
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,160
listen up

359
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,920
i have a pretty good barometer for

360
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:26,000
internet politics which is to say

361
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:27,760
politics i mean i noticed the alt-right

362
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
thing pretty early and you can assign as

363
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,519
much

364
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,040
or as little significance to that as you

365
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:32,320
choose but what i'm picking up at the

366
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,200
moment is that people are getting

367
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,399
[ __ ] mad

368
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,560
and they're starting to get mad

369
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:38,160
specifically at you the rich and you

370
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,560
don't just have to trust my intuitions

371
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,160
here

372
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:42,000
recent polling data shows that a

373
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:44,560
majority of adults under the age of

374
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,440
30 do not support capitalism and almost

375
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,519
a third support

376
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:49,040
socialism this is not the 80s anymore

377
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:50,639
you can't continue to get richer and

378
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,519
richer while the rest of the country is

379
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:53,680

stroll around town dressed like this

00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:20,079
and you'll have to deploy militarized

police and you will crush them

397
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:22,959
ruthlessly but it's gonna be a whole

all i'm saying

00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:17,839
no i mean direct action okay so like a

00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,610
general strike

451
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:25,680

453

tabby i'm not trying to say i have all

454
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:30,399
the answers here because i really don't

455
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,600
but i think we should at least try to

456
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,800
come up with something a little more

457
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,279
substantive than just

458
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,959
saying the word revolution like i'm in

459
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:39,839
support of radical movements

460
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:41,040
occupy wall street 1960s uprisings i

461
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:42,399
think these kinds of movements can

462
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,920
generate a lot of energy

463
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:45,519
they shift the overton window to the

464
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:47,680
left and they can have a big cultural

465
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:48,560
impact but none of them so far has ended

466
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,320
capitalism

467
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:52,320
and capitalism needs the state to

468
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,320
maintain its power and we can change the

469
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,079
state through electoral politics so why

470
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,560
not direct some serious energy toward

471
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:58,639
that

472
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:00,959
well revolutions have worked in russia

473
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:02,320
and china but no elected politician has

474
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:03,760
ever even come close to ending

475
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:06,000
capitalism in the us

476
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:07,680
so why do you think that will work

477
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,120
what's to stop whoever you elect

478
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:11,279
from getting absorbed by the same

479
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,880
corrupt finance backed system that every

480
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:14,720
politician eventually has to swear

481
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,199
allegiance to well you're not entirely

482
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,199
wrong

483
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:18,560
but on the other hand chinese and soviet

484
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:20,720
communism were not exactly

485
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:23,120
super great and in any case i'm having a

486
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:25,199
little bit of trouble imagining a 1917

487
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:27,440

488

pennsylvania avenue in 2018.

489
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,639
shouldn't we focus on protecting

490
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:32,000
abortion and getting affordable health

491
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:34,000
care and education

492
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,920
and ending mass incarceration and other

00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,440
achievable goals what if the 2020

494
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:39,519
