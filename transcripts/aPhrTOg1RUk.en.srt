the history of twitter.com net.gov I

4
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:25,240
realize that to you children Twitter is

5
00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:27,960
an app but to us mils it remains a

6
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:30,160
website we have to dial in

19
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:03,440
conspicuous consumption and and many

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,040
many promises of excellent selfies for

00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:09,360

American cheese languishing over sliced

26
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:20,600

00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:22,640

an ordinary peasant told the queen Jam

00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:24,879
your skin is so perfect ooo and jamaa

49
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:28,000
replied my skin is currently clear

50
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:30,160
because a privileged people have more

51
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,599
access to good quality nutrition and

52
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:35,400
also our lives are significantly less

53
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:37,560
stressful than those with less privilege

54
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,319
I also get to sleep more because of this

55
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:41,200
all of these things keep my hormones in

56
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:44,280
balance and I'm able to address food

57
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:47,800
intolerances easily B I believe that

58
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:50,879
trans rights are human rights see I

00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:52,640
exfoliate twice a week oh boy Jam

00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,760
they're going to cut your head off Gorge

I'll protect you Queen could she be any

62
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:59,840
more annoying someone wandered on

63
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,840
Twitter to 77,000 likes this trend of

64
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:05,080
fake self-awareness legit makes me want

65
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:07,640
to rip my hair out now look to be fair

66
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:10,040
everything Jam said is true being

67
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:12,680
privileged does make it easier to spend

68
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:15,599
time and money on Cosmetics but jamila's

69
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:18,720
acknowledging this this recitation of

70
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:20,560
all the complex socioeconomic factors

71
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:23,480
that account for why she's prettier than

72
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:26,640
you doesn't take any of the sting out of

73
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:29,120
inequality does it and that's kind of at

74
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,760
odds with what activists used to say

75
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,680
which is that you should check your

76
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:35,000
privilege a suggestion which the

77
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:37,000
privileged seemed to have taken to Heart

78
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,519
since the rich and famous now go around

79
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,239
delivering these orations on how

80
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:43,799
fortunate they are compared to the Rabel

81
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:45,480
and this of course turns out to be far

82
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:47,760
more annoying than when they acted

83
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:51,040
oblivious to it I don't have any beauty

84
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:54,159
secrets I guess I just drink lots of

85
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:56,159
water take me mother a similar Scandal

86
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:57,959
occurred when Kim Kardashian tweeted

87
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:00,599
about her birthday party at the height

88
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:03,400
of the Corona virus pandemic 40 and

89
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:05,799
feeling so humbled and blessed there is

90
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:07,439
not a single day that I take for granted

91
00:04:05,799 --> 00:04:09,040
especially during these times when we

92
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:11,680
are all reminded of the things that

93
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:13,519
truly matter after 2 weeks of multiple

94
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:16,120
Health screens and asking everyone to

95
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:18,519
quarantine I surprised my closest inner

96
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:19,799
circle with a trip to a private island

97
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:22,320
where we could pretend things were

98
00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:24,160
normal for just a brief moment in time I

99
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,960
realized that for most people this is

100
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,440
something that is so far Out Of Reach

101
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:30,800
right now so in moments like these I'm

102
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:35,960
humbly reminded of how privileged my

103
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:38,680
life is # this is40 tag me [ __ ] so like

104
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:41,080
jam Kim is attempting some kind of

105
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:44,080
privilege checking maneuver and once

106
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:46,479
again it has not gone well you are the

107
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:48,840
Marie Anette of the 21st century

108
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:51,759
bragging about being humble and letting

109
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:54,360
us eat cake millions of Americans sick

110
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:56,560
and suffering standing for hours in food

111
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:59,039
lines and being evicted as you flaunt

112
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:02,600
your wealth and privilege your Tweet

113
00:04:59,039 --> 00:05:06,240
made 10 times worse by # tonev humbled

114
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:08,560
and blessed line # gross happy

115
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,759
birthday I hope somebody got you an

116
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,639
alphabet book as a gift so you can read

117
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:15,759
the [ __ ] so the response on

118
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:17,520
Twitter resembles moral outrage but what

119
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:20,160
people were upset about was not that she

120
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:22,000
had the party I mean wouldn't you escape

121
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,919
to a private island if you got that mil

122
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,639
money the problem was more that she

123
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:30,759
tweeted about it and that the Tweet was

124
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:33,400
maybe just maybe a little bit yikes but

125
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:35,759
if having the party wasn't wrong then

126
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:40,560
why was tweeting about it wrong this

127
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:44,520
isn't a good look we say bad Optics not

128
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:46,800
relatable relatable relatability is not

129
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:48,759
a moral category this is public

130
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,800
relations it's not ethics and it

131
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:52,880
definitely isn't socialism like I'm

132
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:56,160
pretty sure Carl Marx never said the

133
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:59,080
problem with the Bazi is they are not

134
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:01,240
relatable they can't read the room and

135
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:04,800
it isn't good look this should have

136
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:07,280
stayed in the drafts # tonee isn't the

137
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,639
issue that when Kim tweeted this most

138
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:12,360
people were trapped in quarantine we

139
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:14,199
didn't get to have birthday parties some

140
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:16,840
people couldn't even travel to visit

141
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:19,160
their dying relatives so watching Kim

142
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:23,639
get to travel and celebrate her birthday

143
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:26,120
like normal was painful pain at the Good

144
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:28,560
Fortune of others is how Aristotle

145
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:31,000
defined envy and I think it's

146
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:34,280
interesting that whenever social media

147
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:37,680
erupts an outrage over luxury music

148
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:38,960
festivals or Kim K's birthday party or

149
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,560
Jam

150
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:45,360
J's privileged pores no one ever uses

151
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:48,039
the word envy it's like we're averting

152
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:50,720
our eyes avoiding confrontation with

153
00:06:48,039 --> 00:06:52,639
this dark aspect of our own psychology

154
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:56,080
so in this video I want to take a long

155
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:58,639
hard look at Envy what is it where does

156
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:00,479
it come from and seriously what is Jam

157
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:03,280
Jam's skincare routine drop it in the

158
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:05,199
comments bestie okay so what is Envy

159
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:07,599
pain at the Good Fortune of others is

160
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:11,840
not a bad start but there's more to it

161
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:14,280
than that Envy is a syndrome a complex

162
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:17,360
of poisonous thoughts and feelings about

163
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:19,879
people who have what we want but cannot

164
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:22,400
get it's not simply wanting what another

165
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:24,520
person has that's greed which is a much

166
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:27,319
more wholesome sin because simply

167
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:29,720
wanting what someone has can Inspire us

168
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:32,240
it can fuel our own ambition it can even

169
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:34,840
motivate us to improve ourselves and

170
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:37,360
sometimes people call that Envy but it's

171
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:39,639
not really Envy it's emulation or

172
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:42,599
admiration at worst it's what the Bible

173
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:45,000
calls coveting he covets Envy is

174
00:07:42,599 --> 00:07:47,720
something darker it's not just wanting

175
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,879
what someone has it's begrudging them

176
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:52,240
what they have you might even hate the

177
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:54,599
person you envy and want them to lose

178
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:57,759
what they have to be humiliated and

179
00:07:54,599 --> 00:08:00,720
destroyed even if their downfall doesn't

180
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:03,440
benefit you in any way like Satan who is

181
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:05,360
willing to lose Heaven just despite God

182
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,240
according to the poet John milon it's

183
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:10,520
going to be 90 minutes of mil jokes kids

184
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:12,759
so strap in so Envy is malicious it's a

185
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:14,639
force of Destruction for an example of

186
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:18,240
the distinction between envy and

187
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:20,000
emulation think about incels involuntary

188
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,800
celibates these men who can't get

189
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,039
girlfriends and are bitter about it

190
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:27,000
online it was incels who contributed to

191
00:08:24,039 --> 00:08:29,960
our culture the concept of Chads that is

192
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:33,120
beautiful wealthy masculine men for

193
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:35,800
incels taking the red pill means buying

194
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:38,120
into an ideology which says that women

195
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:40,360
only want to date Chads or else they

196
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:44,360
want to marry beta cucks just to take

197
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:46,360
their beta bucks gas keep gate boss girl

198
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:48,480
light so if you're an incel you can

199
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:51,399
either go to the gym and try to become a

200
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:54,279
Chad that's emulation the aspiration to

201
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:56,440
attain what another person has or and

202
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:58,399
this is the more popular option you can

203
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:00,399
take the black pill which means

204
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:02,880
believing that Chad hood is genetically

205
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:04,600
determined at Birth there is no hope no

206
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,560
woman will ever want you and therefore

207
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:09,320
happiness is impossible you may as well

208
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:11,920
lie down and rock this mindset of

209
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:14,519
resentment has inspired so many mass

210
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:16,839
murders there's an entire Wikipedia

211
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:18,680
timeline dedicated to tracking them and

212
00:09:16,839 --> 00:09:21,959
the essential motivation for this

213
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:24,480
violence is Envy the incel's failed

214
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:27,560
ambition and sense of incurable

215
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:29,839
predestined inferiority turns venomous

216
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:32,279
the logic behind the violence is if I

217
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:35,839
can't get a girlfriend if I can't get

218
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:39,120
what I want then no one can in the words

219
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:41,600
of a murderer the day of Retribution is

220
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:44,120
my attempt to destroy everything I

221
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:47,279
cannot have but most incels aren't

222
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:50,040
murderers most of the time Envy is most

223
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:52,720
harmful to the person who envies the

224
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:54,720
philosopher Max shayer called it a self-

225
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,920
poisoning of the mind there's a

226
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:59,160
Christian saying that Envy is the only

227
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:03,560
sin that gives no pleasure because the

228
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:06,560
other are fun right greed gluttony lust

229
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:08,760
that's what I call a good time but Envy

230
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:11,279
is misery though I wouldn't go so far as

231
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:13,839
to say it gives no pleasure fire

232
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:16,360
Festival is an art installation where

233
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:20,320
mediocre people realize what their lives

234
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:23,040
would be like without Rich parents yes

235
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:25,000
Rich Refugee crisis we're living in a

236
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:27,279
moment of growing inequality and

237
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,959
resentment look around you we've got the

238
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:31,959
guillotine memes we've got edgy teens

239
00:10:29,959 --> 00:10:35,079
tweeting Eat the Rich and none of this

240
00:10:31,959 --> 00:10:36,800
is new the slogan Eat the Rich actually

241
00:10:35,079 --> 00:10:39,440
originates with the philosopher of the

242
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:43,000
French Revolution Jaa Gabor who

243
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:46,959
supposedly said when the people have no

244
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,440
more to eat they will uh Eat the Rich

245
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:50,880
and fair enough it's a good source of

246
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:53,000
protein but take it from me kids

247
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:55,360
cannibalism is one of those tricky

248
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,079
things it's hard to do just once you

249
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,880
develop a taste for it it's like they

250
00:10:57,079 --> 00:11:02,519
say at NA meetings once You' wor you

251
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:05,639
just want more also who counts as the

252
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:08,000
rich am I the rich I certainly hope so

253
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:11,160
cuz I want you to

254
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,519
eat stop it see this is why I quit

255
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:15,399
Academia if I was a professor I'd have

256
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:17,920
to behave myself and I don't want to

257
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:23,360
behave myself I want to be bad do you

258
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:23,360
want to be bad with me let's be bad

259
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:30,309
[Music]

260
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:35,669
[Music]

261
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:41,900
[Music]

262
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:50,120
so you might think that Envy is simply

263
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:52,240
the product of inequality and that

264
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:54,480
societies that have more inequality have

265
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,959
more Envy I used to assume that too but

266
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,800
the more I think about it the more I

267
00:11:55,959 --> 00:12:00,480
realize that might not be true Envy is a

268
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,839
basic part part of human nature it

269
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:05,880
exists in all societies and all economic

270
00:12:02,839 --> 00:12:08,279
systems and it begins anytime two or

271
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:12,000
more people start comparing themselves

272
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:15,279
part two the desire for mommy's

273
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:18,240
milk according to Sigman Freud or as I

274
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:21,079
call him daddy daddy the first stage of

275
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:23,440
human development is the oral stage in

276
00:12:21,079 --> 00:12:25,120
which the primary concern is oral

277
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:28,279
gratification which is of course

278
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:30,959
provided by Mommy milkies am I doing too

279
00:12:28,279 --> 00:12:32,839
much I'll to just a little bit so look I

280
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:35,320
get that a lot of people are skeptical

281
00:12:32,839 --> 00:12:37,839
about Freud and it's true he was a bit

282
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:40,639
of a crackpot Coke fiend who had some

283
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:43,079
zeny ideas like penis envy maybe there's

284
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:44,839
transgender men who experiened that but

285
00:12:43,079 --> 00:12:47,199
I don't think it's a basic fact of the

286
00:12:44,839 --> 00:12:49,760
female condition as for castration

287
00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:51,320
anxiety is that a dare because I take

288
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:53,440
that personally I'm giving it a very

289
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:55,959
serious consideration doctor but I feel

290
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:58,240
like even when Freud is wrong he's often

291
00:12:55,959 --> 00:12:59,680
at least on to something like with the

292
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,880
edus comp

293
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:04,480
it's not that you literally desire your

294
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:07,800
mother right that would be weird it's

295
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:10,839
more that you desire an archetype mother

296
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:12,440
right mommy you guys get it jenzy Tik

297
00:13:10,839 --> 00:13:14,519
Tok lesbians get it they're the ones who

298
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:16,639
got me started on this mil [ __ ] I'm a

299
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:18,519
reverse socres I've been corrupted by

300
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:21,199
the young my innocent and delicate

301
00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:23,199
Nature has been defiled so Freud says

302
00:13:21,199 --> 00:13:25,800
that in the first two years of life

303
00:13:23,199 --> 00:13:28,360
libido is primarily focused on mommy's

304
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:31,040
milk and it's also in this stage that

305
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:33,360
Envy first emerges so I was the oldest

306
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:35,320
child in my family and I was less than 2

307
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,760
years old when my brother was born so I

308
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:39,160
don't remember this because I was

309
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:41,720
one-year-old but my family tells me that

310
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:44,040
when my brother was born I was just

311
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:45,680
insanely jealous oh and I guess now is a

312
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:48,720
good time to discuss the difference

313
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:51,000
between jealousy and envy Scholars agree

314
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:53,160
that there is a difference and

315
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,600
usually and usually they describe the

316
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:57,920
difference in one of two ways the first

317
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,680
is that jealousy is defensive it's a

318
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:02,279
kind of protectiveness over what is

319
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:04,360
rightfully yours whereas Envy is

320
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:06,800
offensive it's resentment over what

321
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:08,480
someone else has that you lack and the

322
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,600
second difference is that Envy is

323
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,560
between two people the envier and the

324
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:14,680
envied whereas jealousy typically

325
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:16,720
involves three people as in romantic

326
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:19,079
jealousy where you have the subject the

327
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:21,040
Romantic object and then the Rival and

328
00:14:19,079 --> 00:14:22,639
the subject is jealous of the Rival

329
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,880
because they're protective of their

330
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:26,639
relationship with the Romantic object

331
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:29,120
and that's also the dynamic of sibling

332
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:31,240
rivalry just substituting the romantic

333
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,839
object for mommy of course in ordinary

334
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:35,120
English people are always going to say

335
00:14:32,839 --> 00:14:37,160
jealousy when they really mean Envy

336
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:39,000
probably because jealousy has less

337
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:40,759
negative connotations and I think it's

338
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,040
pointless to try to fight that like I

339
00:14:40,759 --> 00:14:44,240
wouldn't go around correcting people but

340
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:47,079
just keep in mind that there is a

341
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:50,000
difference so sibling rivalry is that

342
00:14:47,079 --> 00:14:52,120
Envy or jealousy well I think it's both

343
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,240
because initially you're defensive of

344
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:56,680
your privileged only child relationship

345
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,560
with your parents but a new baby often

346
00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:01,000
gets more attention at least in your

347
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:03,680
paranoid toddler brain and you might be

348
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:06,160
envious of that and in romantic jealousy

349
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:08,279
you may also Envy the Rival if she has

350
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:10,480
qualities that you wish you had you know

351
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:12,959
young kids are little egotists who are

352
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:15,199
very sensitive to when another child

353
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:17,079
might be getting preferential treatment

354
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:22,759
one of the favorite phrases of tiny

355
00:15:17,079 --> 00:15:25,440
babies is it's not fair it's not

356
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:28,279
fair tell me about it Bambino and I've

357
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:30,160
got bad news life is not getting any

358
00:15:28,279 --> 00:15:32,560
more fair than this according to the

359
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:36,199
Bible one of the first events in human

360
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:38,319
history is the story of Cen

361
00:15:36,199 --> 00:15:39,920
abelos I don't know why I said it in

362
00:15:38,319 --> 00:15:43,560
Spanish I I guess I just thought it

363
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:45,959
would sound cool was I wrong Cen it just

364
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:49,639
sounds so much better than Cain Cain and

365
00:15:45,959 --> 00:15:52,279
Abel Cain and Abel God tells Cain and

366
00:15:49,639 --> 00:15:56,040
Abel each to make a sacrifice and then

367
00:15:52,279 --> 00:15:59,480
God prefers Ables you know cuz God loves

368
00:15:56,040 --> 00:16:01,880
meat then in an act of malicious toward

369
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:04,639
Abel and spite towards God the Father

370
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:06,720
Cen kills his younger brother in my

371
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:08,800
earliest memories of my brother I

372
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:12,480
already loved him and I don't remember

373
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:14,279
the Envy so I guess I wasn't a Cain Cen

374
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:17,720
so I must have somehow worked through

375
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:20,040
this without resorting to murder H Freud

376
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:22,759
says that the older siblings Envy of the

377
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:25,680
younger leads to a recognition of

378
00:16:22,759 --> 00:16:28,440
impotence because at first you selfishly

379
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:29,959
want to be the special most loved child

380
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:32,319
but you see see that your parents love

381
00:16:29,959 --> 00:16:34,319
your sibling just as much as you and

382
00:16:32,319 --> 00:16:37,600
you're powerless to do anything about it

383
00:16:34,319 --> 00:16:40,040
so your ambition to superiority fails

384
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:42,519
and so you have no choice but to repress

385
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:44,399
your ambition to superiority as well as

386
00:16:42,519 --> 00:16:47,160
your envy and the result of that

387
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:50,000
repression is what we could call herd

388
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:52,399
Instinct solidarity this feeling of

389
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,800
identifying with a group the equal

390
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:57,279
siblings and as you get older the herd

391
00:16:54,800 --> 00:17:00,519
Instinct evolves into feelings about

392
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:03,519
Justice Duty imunity and equality but

393
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:06,679
Freud thought these feelings retain a

394
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:09,520
vestage of repressed Envy if I can't be

395
00:17:06,679 --> 00:17:12,760
the favorite if I can't have special

396
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:14,919
privileges then no one can and from

397
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:18,079
these observations Freud made the

398
00:17:14,919 --> 00:17:22,039
generalization social justice means that

399
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:25,039
we deny ourselves many things so that

400
00:17:22,039 --> 00:17:27,079
others may have to do without them as

401
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:30,160
well okay so we don't want other people

402
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:33,240
to have anything we can't have so we

403
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:35,480
enviously insist on equality as a

404
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:37,840
defense against the greater prosperity

405
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:39,760
of others now I don't think I completely

406
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:41,840
agree with that like I think Freud is

407
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:43,760
definitely on to something here but

408
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:46,640
don't some of our community feelings

409
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:48,600
also come from a place of genuine care

410
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:52,160
for other

411
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:55,039
people I cared for someone

412
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:57,960
once

413
00:17:55,039 --> 00:18:00,520
BR well we'll come back to that later

414
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:04,360
let's put a pin in me for now a a pin in

415
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:05,840
it for now and Freud I mean let's put a

416
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:10,000
pin in

417
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:11,799
Freud in a 1966 book titled Envy a

418
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,360
theory of social behavior the

419
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:16,120
sociologist Helmut shook argued that

420
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:18,520
rather than being that is a very German

421
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:22,280
name Helmut he putting me in a German

422
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:25,200
mood sweetie H Min

423
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:27,159
leous video I just get worse at German

424
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,120
every year shook argued that rather than

425
00:18:27,159 --> 00:18:31,679
being the result of social or e economic

426
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:34,159
inequality Envy is a universal across

427
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:37,280
all human societies including very

428
00:18:34,159 --> 00:18:39,240
egalitarian ones for example in tribal

429
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:41,600
and Village cultures around the world

430
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:43,760
there's often a concept of black magic

431
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:46,360
or witchcraft which are thought to be

432
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:48,400
used by envious people to bewitch the

433
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:50,440
ones they Envy you're probably familiar

434
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:52,360
with the concept of the evil eye which

435
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:54,559
originates in ancient Greece or maybe

436
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:57,400
even earlier than that cultures all over

437
00:18:54,559 --> 00:19:00,520
the world today understand the evil eye

438
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:02,760
as a kind of curse cast by the malignant

439
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:04,799
gaze of an envious person now you might

440
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:06,440
be thinking that sounds superstitious

441
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:09,120
but I actually think the concept of the

442
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:11,480
evil eye reveals a more sophisticated

443
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:13,600
awareness of envy and of the social

444
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:15,840
danger that it poses you've probably

445
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:17,880
seen these amulets around there's an

446
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:20,159
emoji for them now which are supposed to

447
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:22,480
protect against the evil eye it's called

448
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:24,840
a Nazar which comes from the Arabic word

449
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:26,760
for sight or surveillance similar to the

450
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:29,039
origin of the English word envy which is

451
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:31,480
the Latin Invidia which just means to

452
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:33,960
look at so there's an agreement across

453
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:36,480
cultures that Envy is related to sight

454
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:38,440
the malevolent gaze the evil eye and

455
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,919
these amulets show that a lot of people

456
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:43,039
are afraid of being envied and want to

457
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:44,760
protect themselves I was just watching

458
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:46,799
this Turkish YouTube channel with an

459
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:49,679
episode on the evil eye and the host

460
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:50,840
explains that for Muslims it's customary

461
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:53,880
to

462
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:55,919
say or God has wed it when admiring a

463
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:58,039
person or object you know to avoid

464
00:19:55,919 --> 00:20:00,120
unintentionally cursing them I love that

465
00:19:58,039 --> 00:20:03,760
it's like no end like no homo but no

466
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:05,840
Envy masah the top comment on that video

467
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:08,080
says you want to protect yourself from

468
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:10,240
the evil green ey monster well don't

469
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:12,440
tell others about your ideas goals or

470
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:14,320
wishes don't be flaunting your

471
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:17,240
accomplishments on social media or

472
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:19,640
posting pictures of your children that's

473
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:21,320
how you avoid being jinxed see this is

474
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:23,679
where Kim Kardashian went wrong with her

475
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:26,039
birthday post clearly no one in the

476
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:27,720
Kardashian Cinematic Universe has ever

477
00:20:26,039 --> 00:20:29,400
heard of the evil eye wait I thought

478
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:33,080
these people were Armenian why haven't

479
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:34,679
they heard of the oh okay never mind

480
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:37,159
every piece of media they've ever

481
00:20:34,679 --> 00:20:39,159
produced is about flaunting an enviable

482
00:20:37,159 --> 00:20:42,080
lifestyle this is a particularly

483
00:20:39,159 --> 00:20:45,360
American thing most Americans have no

484
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:47,039
concept of the fear of Envy like there's

485
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:50,240
advertisements here that literally

486
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:52,679
promise if you buy this exclusive luxury

487
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:55,039
vibrator you'll be the Envy of all your

488
00:20:52,679 --> 00:20:57,960
friends as if it's a good thing to be

489
00:20:55,039 --> 00:21:00,080
envied oh but it is not if people Envy

490
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:02,640
you they gossip about you right they

491
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:04,960
seee over your successes and celebrate

492
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:07,760
your misfortunes being envied is

493
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:10,000
basically the opposite of being loved so

494
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:11,880
why would anyone want to be envied well

495
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,279
it's a contradiction of human nature on

496
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:16,520
the one hand we need to be loved but

497
00:21:14,279 --> 00:21:20,559
then there's this other Drive in us this

498
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:22,960
like homeric striving for fame and glory

499
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:25,080
and riches which is kind of In conflict

500
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,919
with our need to be loved in a past

501
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:29,600
guilded age there were stories like

502
00:21:26,919 --> 00:21:32,559
Citizen Cane and son said Boulevard

503
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:36,960
which warned what a sad and lonely thing

504
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:39,880
success can become in ancient Democratic

505
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:41,799
Athens there was a practice called ostra

506
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:44,679
kismos which is the origin of the

507
00:21:41,799 --> 00:21:46,480
English word ostracism ostracism was a

508
00:21:44,679 --> 00:21:48,720
procedure where the Athenians would

509
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:50,320
assemble and each person would write the

510
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:53,120
name of a person they wanted to

511
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:55,520
ostracize on a pottery Shard called an

512
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:57,520
ostron and whoever got the most votes

513
00:21:55,520 --> 00:22:00,039
would simply be banished from the city

514
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:02,480
for 10 years no questions

515
00:22:00,039 --> 00:22:05,559
asked I love the ancient world things

516
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:07,720
were so direct often this was used to

517
00:22:05,559 --> 00:22:10,120
remove someone who is becoming too

518
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:12,559
prominent or too arrogant or just

519
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:14,159
annoying according to Plutarch I'm just

520
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:16,679
going to read this from Wikipedia and

521
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:19,640
one anecdote about aristedes known as

522
00:22:16,679 --> 00:22:22,120
aristes the just who was ostracized in

523
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:24,440
482 an illiterate citizen not

524
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:26,760
recognizing him came up to ask him to

525
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:29,559
write the name aristes on his ostron

526
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:30,960
when aristes asked why the man replied

527
00:22:29,559 --> 00:22:32,960
it was because he was sick of hearing

528
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:36,880
him being called the

529
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:39,080
just it's good it's so good see this is

530
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,799
why the idea of cancel culture is absurd

531
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:43,559
this has been going on since the dawn of

532
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:46,240
civilization people in most cultures not

533
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:48,080
all but most cultures understand that

534
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:50,440
being envied is a massive social

535
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:52,320
liability so it's best not to draw too

536
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:55,039
much attention to yourself according to

537
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:57,400
a tamel saying the tree that bears fruit

538
00:22:55,039 --> 00:23:00,120
will be stoned this is sometimes called

539
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:03,039
tall poppy s because the tallest poppies

540
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:05,320
in the garden will be cut shook argues

541
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:07,880
that the fear of Envy is a major

542
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:10,320
inhibiting force in many Societies in

543
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:12,360
Haiti G Simpson found that a peasant

544
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:14,159
will seek to disguise his true economic

545
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:16,240
position by purchasing several smaller

546
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:18,080
Fields rather than one larger piece of

547
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,919
land for the same reason he will not

548
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,799
wear good clothes he does this

549
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:24,159
intentionally to protect himself against

550
00:23:21,799 --> 00:23:25,880
the envious black magic of his neighbors

551
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:27,760
now this kind of thing is not unheard of

552
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:30,039
in America like I've known people from

553
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:32,159
seriously wealthy families who move to

554
00:23:30,039 --> 00:23:34,480
the city and they dress like gutter

555
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:37,080
punks like they're trying to pass as

556
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:39,840
poor but in general Americans don't

557
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:41,679
openly acknowledge fear of Envy in the

558
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:43,480
way many other cultures do and I don't

559
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:45,679
think that's an accident We're a nation

560
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:47,799
of showoffs and so the taboo against

561
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:49,799
discussing Envy is related to our whole

562
00:23:47,799 --> 00:23:51,480
National ethos of shoving our wealth in

563
00:23:49,799 --> 00:23:53,039
everyone's face but though the fear of

564
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:55,279
Envy isn't widely talked about or

565
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:57,760
admitted here it's definitely still

566
00:23:55,279 --> 00:24:01,200
there only repressed confined to the

567
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:01,200
realm of dreams and

568
00:24:02,039 --> 00:24:07,320
art in the movie Black Swan Nina is a

569
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:08,880
Perfection obsessed ballerina who

570
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:11,200
achieves her dream of getting the lead

571
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:13,880
role in Swan Lake after which her life

572
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:17,600
and mind are totally unraveled by fear

573
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:19,919
of Envy Black Magic Black Swan at first

574
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:22,919
we see how Nina's success comes at the

575
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:25,440
very real cost of being envied by her ex

576
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:27,440
ballerina Mother by the other girls in

577
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:30,559
the company and by the former lead

578
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:33,120
ballerina she's placed did you suck

579
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:35,840
his not all of us have

580
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:38,720
to I love wiona ryer so much I love

where's my shock wand stop it stop

584
00:24:42,919 --> 00:24:47,520
standing but reasonable fear of Envy

585
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:50,120
becomes paranoia as nah begins

586
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:53,320
hallucinating Black Swan doppelgangers

587
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:55,200
and is seduced by bisexual demon munes

588
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:57,399
who's trying to steal her role you got

589
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:59,760
to watch out for those bisexual demons

590
00:24:57,399 --> 00:25:02,360
they'll get you did you have some sort

591
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:03,760
of lesy wet dream about me stop you

592
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:06,440
could argue that nah is actually

593
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:08,640
suffering a kind of self Envy where she

594
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:11,279
envies the disinhibited sexually

595
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:13,760
liberated corrupted part of herself

596
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:16,440
that's capable of adult eroticism and

597
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:18,279
also of dancing the Black Swan so she

598
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:20,679
imagines that part of herself as an

599
00:25:18,279 --> 00:25:23,200
envious rival who's trying to replace

600
00:25:20,679 --> 00:25:25,880
her it's like her mind is suit between

601
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:28,320
two impulses there's her dominant White

602
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:30,760
Swan impulse which we could call the

603
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:35,120
Squidward personality perfectionistic

604
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:37,200
and orderly but reserved priggish stiff

605
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:39,799
and then there's her repressed Black

606
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:44,039
Swan impulse which we could call the

607
00:25:39,799 --> 00:25:46,960
SpongeBob personality intuitive chaotic

608
00:25:44,039 --> 00:25:49,600
ecstatic in SpongeBob SquarePants the

609
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:52,000
character Squidward is fundamentally a

610
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:54,520
figure of Envy stemming from failed

611
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:57,520
ambition hello you've reached the house

612
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:59,159
of unrecognized talent Squidward aspires

613
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:01,840
to Artistic ACH achievement but remains

614
00:25:59,159 --> 00:26:04,840
in mediocrity partly because of his

615
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:07,600
overly dry doctrinaire attitude towards

616
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:09,559
art SpongeBob is Squidward's social

617
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:11,120
equal they're literally neighbors and

618
00:26:09,559 --> 00:26:13,480
they both work the same fast food

619
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:16,399
service job for the same exploitative

620
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:19,080
capitalist but SpongeBob is a mardian

621
00:26:16,399 --> 00:26:21,279
intuitive genius who's able to transform

622
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:24,000
the most mundane activities blowing

623
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:27,000
bubbles flipping burgers into a kind of

624
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:29,600
aesthetic Rapture Squidward intensely

625
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:32,360
envies SpongeBob's uninhibited joy and

626
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:35,279
intuitive creativity but he can't admit

627
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:37,720
that Envy to himself so he convinces

628
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:40,320
himself that what he's really feeling is

629
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:43,039
contempt snobbish disdain for

630
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:46,520
SpongeBob's childish behavior what the

631
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:48,640
people want is culture not dancing

632
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:52,559
bubbles though deep down Squidward

633
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:55,279
really wants what SpongeBob has it's

634
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:56,760
beautiful uh I mean uh which we see when

635
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:58,640
he can't help himself from blowing

636
00:26:56,760 --> 00:27:00,399
bubbles or when he trades away all of

637
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:02,559
his possessions for the chewing gum

638
00:27:00,399 --> 00:27:04,720
rapper that in SpongeBob's hands was a

639
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:06,600
source of infinite entertainment a lot

640
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:08,919
of people my age who watched SpongeBob

641
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:11,000
as a kid rewatch it now and are

642
00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:13,320
horrified to discover that they identify

643
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,279
with Squidward whereas as children they

644
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:17,320
identified with SpongeBob well you

645
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:18,840
either die a SpongeBob or you live long

646
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:21,039
enough to see yourself become the

647
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:23,440
Squidward

648
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:26,120
future and there's a pain in becoming

649
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:28,520
Squidward which is usually explained as

650
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:30,679
the disappointing drudgery of adult life

651
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:33,120
or simply loss of childhood I would

652
00:27:30,679 --> 00:27:35,720
argue that Envy of childhood is the

653
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:38,200
distinctive squid wardian emotion

654
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:40,360
Squidward are we saying that word are we

655
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:42,039
really saying that word out loud to an

656
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:44,880
audience of

657
00:27:42,039 --> 00:27:48,200
millions okay it's basically the same

658
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:50,960
dynamic as solar's Envy of Mozart in

659
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:53,120
amadas oh my God the evil eye killed

660
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:55,360
Mozart you got to watch out for that one

661
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:57,159
kids if a mysterious stranger shows up

662
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:59,279
on your doorstep at midnight asking you

663
00:27:57,159 --> 00:28:02,760
to compose a re a math for your own

664
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:05,200
father just say no so in sponge medas

665
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:07,640
Mozart pants we have a diligent those

666
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:10,050
stuffy wannabe envying the effortless

667
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:13,099
playfulness of the spontaneous

668
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:13,099
[Music]

669
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:28,200
genius so Squidward's Envy of SpongeBob

670
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:29,720
is well it's Apollo's Envy of dionis

671
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:31,559
look if we were to view SpongeBob

672
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:33,480
SquarePants through the philosophy of

673
00:28:31,559 --> 00:28:35,200
Friedrich Nisha stay with me ladies I

674
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:37,240
have an angle here we could say that

675
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:39,840
Squidward represents what Nicha called

676
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:42,279
the apollonian impulse while SpongeBob

677
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:44,440
represents the dionan Nicha thought

678
00:28:42,279 --> 00:28:46,760
there were two conflicting artistic

679
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:48,519
drives in the human personality the

680
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:51,240
apollonian named after the Greek god

681
00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:54,960
Apollo is the drive towards self-control

682
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:57,159
order logic morality and the dionan

683
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,559
named after dionis is the drive toward

684
00:28:57,159 --> 00:29:02,200
intoxication

685
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:05,000
frenzy passion intuition both SpongeBob

686
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:08,519
and Amadeus present these two drives in

687
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:10,519
conflict with the apollonian envying the

688
00:29:08,519 --> 00:29:12,799
dionan of course this is a

689
00:29:10,519 --> 00:29:15,360
misrepresentation of how art is actually

690
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:17,799
created because n's whole point is that

691
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:20,559
you need a balance of the two drives in

692
00:29:17,799 --> 00:29:23,000
reality you cannot have a pure dionysian

693
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:25,679
artist like SpongeBob because creating

694
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:28,399
good art requires at least some level of

695
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:29,960
discipline and ordering see it is is all

696
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:32,360
in the technique otherwise you're just

697
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:35,480
some drunk idiot with a guitar get off

698
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:37,679
the stage so Black Swan is in a way

699
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:40,559
actually more realistic in order to give

700
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:42,960
the perfect performance nah has to unify

701
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:45,799
her fragmented personality and dance

702
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:47,799
both swans resolving the envious rivalry

703
00:29:45,799 --> 00:29:51,320
between her two artistic

704
00:29:47,799 --> 00:29:51,320
impulses that was

705
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:59,880
perfect another movie about fear of

706
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:02,480
envious B Arina

707
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:05,519
doppelgangers can you guess it is Jordan

708
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:08,080
peele's 2019 horror film us which

709
00:30:05,519 --> 00:30:11,200
dramatizes the repressed economic guilt

710
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:13,840
and fear of the American middle class we

711
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:16,720
meet the Wilsons a moderately affluent

712
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:19,720

714
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:25,360

monstrous doppelgangers red the only

720
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:39,880
doppelganger who can speak explains that

721
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:42,000
her family is metaphysically Tethered to

722
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:44,279
the Wilsons living wretched and

723
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,799

two were connected tethered together

when the girl ate her food was given to

731
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:12,919
was hungry she had to eat rabbit raw and

732
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:16,679

title of the movie oh the tethered have

735
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:24,799
risen up to kill their privileged

736
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:27,159
doppelgangers and to link arms across

737
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:29,919
the country in a dark parody of the real

738
00:31:27,159 --> 00:31:33,120
world 198 86 homelessness fundraiser

739
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:35,559
Hands Across America so my reading of us

740
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:38,360
is that it's an expression of middle

741
00:31:35,559 --> 00:31:41,080
class guilt about privilege and fear of

742
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:42,679
Envy it's not a movie about the working

743
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:44,519
class if it was a movie about the

744
00:31:42,679 --> 00:31:46,440
working class then the working class

745
00:31:44,519 --> 00:31:48,399
would be able to speak human languages

746
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:49,360
and would not be scary monsters who make

747
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:52,600
animal

748
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:54,960
sounds and Stager around like zombies

749
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:58,080
this is a movie about the anxious middle

750
00:31:54,960 --> 00:32:00,760
class's nightmare of the working class

751
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:03,039
US represents in a self-aware way what

752
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:05,559
other home invasion movies represent

753
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:09,200
unconsciously the fear of the envious

754
00:32:05,559 --> 00:32:11,200
poor of revolution of slave revolt tell

755
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:13,360
me you did not just reference home alone

756
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:15,720
but us diverges from other home invasion

757
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:19,320
movies by not just being fearful about

758
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:22,159
the underclass but also guilty the idea

759
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:24,600
of the tethered underclass represents

760
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:27,360
life as a zero sum game where every

761
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:29,760
moment of your happiness is bought with

762
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:32,320
someone else's suffering it's an

763
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:35,360
incredibly guilty fantasy an

764
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:37,120
internalization of the Blackmagic logic

765
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:39,799
of people who blame their own

766
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:42,320
misfortunes on the people they Envy as

767
00:32:39,799 --> 00:32:44,120
shook puts it my neighbor's Harvest can

768
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:45,880
only have turned out better than mine

769
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:48,639
because he has somehow succeeded in

770
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:51,399
reducing Mine by black magic so the fear

771
00:32:48,639 --> 00:32:53,799
of envy and the guilt of success are

772
00:32:51,399 --> 00:32:56,200
repressed in American culture but they

773
00:32:53,799 --> 00:32:57,840
still find expression in movies Jordan

774
00:32:56,200 --> 00:33:00,279
Peele is kind of like the Charles

775
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:02,760
Dickens of the 21st century us actually

776
00:33:00,279 --> 00:33:04,320
reminds me of A Christmas Carol a story

777
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:06,039
about the guilt of the rich if ever

778
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:08,039
there was one you know Scrooge is

779
00:33:06,039 --> 00:33:09,960
visited by ghosts who show him how

780
00:33:08,039 --> 00:33:12,480
wretched and sad the lives of his

781
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:15,159
employees are and how he'll die alone

782
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:17,360
and hated by everyone and his funeral is

783
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:19,880
only attended by businessmen on the

784
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:22,120
condition that lunch is provided Dickens

785
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:25,120
was truly the master of scaring the rich

786
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:27,760
straight so maybe fear of Envy can serve

787
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:30,200
a softly regulatory function by m

788
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:33,000
motivating charity and generosity in the

789
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:35,559
rich but in general I'm suspicious of

790
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:39,600
Envy as a motivation for politics cuz

791
00:33:35,559 --> 00:33:42,559
remember the basic logic of Envy is if I

792
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:45,639
can't have it then no one can which is a

793
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:48,639
purely negative destructive style of

794
00:33:45,639 --> 00:33:50,279
thinking it's taking privileges away not

795
00:33:48,639 --> 00:33:52,320
for the material benefit of the

796
00:33:50,279 --> 00:33:54,760
underprivileged but merely for the

797
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:57,039
psychological satisfaction of the

798
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:58,880
envious person and that's even worse

799
00:33:57,039 --> 00:34:01,760
when you consider that Envy is

800
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:04,760
subjective it doesn't necessarily Target

801
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:07,399
objective power and privilege so Envy in

802
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:09,800
politics is Not By Any Means relegated

803
00:34:07,399 --> 00:34:11,839
to the left conservative politics is

804
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:14,200
brimming With Envy like in this debate

805
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:16,560
about forgiving student loan debt you

806
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:19,359
often hear people say I had to pay my

807
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:22,800
student loans so they should too debt

808
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:25,000
forgiveness is not fair the logic here

809
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:28,040
is since I didn't get my student debt

810
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:30,399
forgiven no one should it's

811
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:33,000
intergenerational Envy which is a pretty

812
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:35,440
common thing usually older Generations

813
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:38,520
envying the young kids these days have

814
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:41,200
it so easy when I was young we ate nails

815
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:43,399
for breakfast and sent text messages on

816
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:46,320
the Pony Express the feeling is

817
00:34:43,399 --> 00:34:48,440
basically it's not fair that kids these

818
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:51,079
days don't have to suffer like I

819
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:54,320
suffered or think about the concept of a

820
00:34:51,079 --> 00:34:56,040
Welfare Queen which openly reeks of envy

821
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:58,280
and white resentment or the way

822
00:34:56,040 --> 00:35:01,079
conservatives talk about immigration

823
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:03,359
it's all this envious suspicion about

824
00:35:01,079 --> 00:35:05,040
illegal immigrants sneaking in and

825
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:07,359
getting government handouts without

826
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:09,359
having to pay taxes I had to work hard

827
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:11,119
for my money so I should these people

828
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:12,760
get a free ride not that that's what

829
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:16,359
being an illegal immigrant is actually

830
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:18,839
like accept in the imagination of people

831
00:35:16,359 --> 00:35:21,440
who Envy them Envy is felt more

832
00:35:18,839 --> 00:35:24,480
intensely by prideful people so it's

833
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:27,920
especially sharp when it targets people

834
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:30,440
who are supposed to be beneath you the

835
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:32,440
Jewish radical feminist Andrea dorin

836
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:35,440
made what I think is a pretty compelling

837
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:38,560
argument that both anti-Semitism and

838
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:40,760
misogyny are partly rooted in Envy she

839
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:43,400
quotes a bigoted argument made by the

840
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:46,480
wife killing protagonist of tolstoy's

841
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:48,560
story The czer Sonata Who resents that

842
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:50,839
women and Jews find a kind of

843
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:53,359
paradoxical power in their own

844
00:35:50,839 --> 00:35:55,160
oppression just like the Jews as they

845
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:57,839
pay us back for their oppression by

846
00:35:55,160 --> 00:36:00,599
Financial domination so it is with women

847
00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:02,760
ah you want us to be traitors only all

848
00:36:00,599 --> 00:36:05,400
right as traitors we will dominate you

849
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:07,839
say the Jews ah you want us to be merely

850
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:09,760
objects of sensuality all right as

851
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:12,680
objects of sensuality we will enslave

852
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:15,359
you dworin explains this dominance of

853
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:18,920
men by women is experienced by the men

854
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:21,359
is real emotionally real sexually real

855
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:23,920
psychologically real it emerges as the

856
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:26,960
reason for the Wrath of the misogynist

857
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:30,079
the woman appears to control sex The man

858
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:33,040
needs it this causes his rage at her

859
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:35,560
perceived power over him women control

860
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:38,280
access to what men want which gives

861
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:41,520
women a kind of indirect power that some

862
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:43,119
men Envy they Envy the sexual power of

863
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:45,240
women it doesn't matter to the

864
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:48,280
misogynist that especially at the time

865
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:51,240
tolto was writing women objectively have

866
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:54,839
less power in society than men he envies

867
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:57,640
women because they have what he desires

868
00:36:54,839 --> 00:36:59,599
likewise it didn't matter to viar anti

869
00:36:57,640 --> 00:37:02,480
semites that Jewish people were a

870
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:05,680
marginalized minority anti-Semitism is

871
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:08,440
often rooted in an envious obsession

872
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:11,240
with the disproportionate influence and

873
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:12,880
affluence of Jewish people it is not the

874
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:15,839
absolute differences between men which

875
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:18,760
feed Envy but subjective perception the

876
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:18,760
Optics of

877
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:29,520
Envy magic mirror on the wall who's the

878
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:29,520

kind of just in the beginning of this

883
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:50,520
whole transition you know like a young

884
00:37:48,319 --> 00:37:53,040
little girl going through all these

885
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:54,960
things having a sleepover with the girls

Snow White in the wicked mil is the

894
00:38:14,599 --> 00:38:19,680
story of a quote Vain and wicked Queen

895
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:22,359

is the fairest till one day it says the

901

stepdaughter Snow White is the fairest

902
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:37,119
which sends the queen into an envious

903
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:39,680
Fury resulting in a series of bizarre

despite the Injustice done to its lead

918
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:19,079
mil Snow White does illustrate some

919
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:21,440
interesting things about Envy once again

920
00:39:19,079 --> 00:39:23,560
we have black magic and Witchcraft as an

921
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:26,079
expression of Envy we have the age

922
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:28,480
difference intergenerational Envy the

923
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:31,200
Envy of Youth it kind of reminds me of

924
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:33,200
those Millennial women who hit 30 and

925
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:35,880
suddenly feel a need to rage against

926
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:37,680
jenz pretty counterproductive since if

927
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:40,240
you're worried about seeming old

928
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:41,960
complaining about the youths is probably

929
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:43,880
not helping your case Gorge you might

930
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:45,960
wonder if there's also jealousy involved

931
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:47,720
with the evil queen like is she worried

932
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:50,079
that the king is going to fall in love

933
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:52,160
with his own daughter well I don't think

934
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:54,200
so because we never even see the king

935
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:56,240
the queen doesn't mention him it's not

936
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:58,839
about the king so there's no romantic

937
00:39:56,240 --> 00:40:01,000
jealousy involved it's just one woman

938
00:39:58,839 --> 00:40:04,520
envying another woman over Beauty for

939
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:06,680
its own sake we stand a beell test

940
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:10,040
passing movie about women hating each

941
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:12,079
other gate keep gas girl gate girl gas

942
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:14,359
keep light boss in fact in the original

943
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:16,240
brother's Grim version the queen first

944
00:40:14,359 --> 00:40:18,800
tries killing Snow White with beauty

945
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:21,040
accessories poisoning a comb and lacing

946
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:23,520
her to death with a corset I wish I

947
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:27,440
could die that way sh what's really

948
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:29,839
striking is the pure kamakazi malignity

949
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:31,960
of it all this queen who we know is

950
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:34,359
obsessed with her look is willing to

951
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:37,760
transform herself with witchcraft into

952
00:40:34,359 --> 00:40:39,560
an ugly old hag just to give Snow White

953
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:41,440
the poisoned apple and the queen

954
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:43,720
disguising herself as an old hag

955
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:45,560
parallels Satan disguising himself as a

956
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:47,680
serpent I mean you could actually argue

957
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:50,480
that the queen is simply a Persona of

958
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:52,200
Satan it's Paradise Lost all over again

959
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:54,680
which also happens to be the title of my

960
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:56,800
Memoir the queen is incredibly Petty

961
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:59,680
because even according to the again

962
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:01,720
wrong and tasteless mirror she's still

963
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:04,760
the second most beautiful woman in the

964
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:07,720
world how could someone so close to the

965
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:11,359
top of the hierarchy still be consumed

966
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:14,200
by Envy well basically because that's

967
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:16,640
how Envy works it's Petty it's

968
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:19,280
subjective and it's indifferent to the

969
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:20,839
magnitude of the inequality or to the

970
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:23,319
absolute position on the overall

971
00:41:20,839 --> 00:41:26,440
hierarchy so you can be the second best

972
00:41:23,319 --> 00:41:29,079
in the world and still be obsessively

973
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:31,000
envious of the one person who may barely

974
00:41:29,079 --> 00:41:32,640
even be above you in fact there's

975
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:35,000
studies showing that Olympic silver

976
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:37,440
medalists are actually less satisfied

977
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:39,119
with their prize than bronze medalists

978
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:41,240
probably because the bronze medalist is

979
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:43,640
just happy to be on the podium at all

980
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:46,800
while the silver medalist is so close to

981
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:48,800
first they can't help but wonder what if

982
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:51,040
humans form our sense of identity and

983
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:53,240
self-worth not by comparing ourselves to

984
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:55,079
any absolute standard but by comparing

985
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:56,720
ourselves to each other and we're more

986
00:41:55,079 --> 00:41:58,680
likely to compare ourselves to the

987
00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:00,839
people who are are around us than we are

988
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:03,800
to people who are far away we could call

989
00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:05,839
this the proximity effect of Envy we're

990
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:08,720
more likely to envy people who are close

991
00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:10,960
to us or similar to us especially people

992
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:13,160
we're in competition with that's why

993
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:15,200
social media is such a nightmare it's an

994
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:17,560
incubator of Envy because it puts

995
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:20,480
everyone next to everyone else so we're

996
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:22,880
all being compared all in competition

997
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:24,839
and it can destroy your self-esteem

998
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:27,800
because you're comparing your actual

999
00:42:24,839 --> 00:42:30,040
life to these idealized images and it

1000
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:32,599
also turns public figures into lightning

1001
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:36,040
rods for Envy because of the numeric

1002
00:42:32,599 --> 00:42:37,960
visibility of popularity and success

1003
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:40,800
it's a perverse consequence of the

1004
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:43,280
proximity effect that Envy within an

1005
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:45,200
oppressed class is often more venomous

1006
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:48,079
and obsessive than Envy for the

1007
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:51,160
oppressor so for example in Snow White

1008
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:53,559
and Black Swan you have women envying

1009
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:55,240
other women because women are often in

1010
00:42:53,559 --> 00:42:57,400
competition with each other and I know

1011
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:59,599
it's kind of a misogynistic trope in

1012
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:03,160
media there's constant portrayals of

1013
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:07,000
vain and envious women jealous [ __ ]

1014
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:09,520
fighting over men over youth over Beauty

1015
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,839
it's like drag queen femininity Death

1016
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:13,079
Becomes Her

1017
00:43:10,839 --> 00:43:15,800
femininity on

1018
00:43:13,079 --> 00:43:19,920
guard [ __ ] so yeah it's kind of a

1019
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:21,800
misogynistic Trope but how do I put this

1020
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:24,079
delicately sometimes reality is

1021
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:26,720
misogynistic like when my eyelash won't

1022
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:28,680
stay glued on the patriarchy's mockin

1023
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:31,640
naations are clearly to blame in her

1024
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:34,000
1976 essay trashing the Dark Side of

1025
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:35,920
Sisterhood feminist Joe Freeman wrote

1026
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:38,480
about her ostracism from within the

1027
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:40,720
women's movement I've been watching for

1028
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:42,960
years with increasing dismay as the

1029
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:45,520
movement consciously destroys anyone

1030
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:47,319
within it who stands out in any way and

1031
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:50,359
she quotes a speech by fellow feminist

1032
00:43:47,319 --> 00:43:52,040
and Selma Delio and who do they attack

1033
00:43:50,359 --> 00:43:54,599
achievement or accomplishment of any

1034
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:56,559
kind would seem to be the worst crime do

1035
00:43:54,599 --> 00:43:58,920
anything that every other woman secretly

1036
00:43:56,559 --> 00:44:00,920
or otherwise feels she could do just as

1037
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:02,960
well and you're in for it you are

1038
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:05,520
immediately labeled a thrill-seeking

1039
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:07,520
opportunist a ruthless mercenary out to

1040
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:09,680
make her Fame and Fortune over the dead

1041
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:12,160
bodies of selfless sisters who have

1042
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:15,200
buried their abilities and sacrificed

1043
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:18,200
their Ambitions for the greater glory of

1044
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:20,800
feminism Freeman speculates the primary

1045
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:23,839
reason there have been so few great

1046
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:26,680
women blank is not merely that greatness

1047
00:44:23,839 --> 00:44:28,680
has been undeveloped or unrecognized but

1048
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:30,960
that women women exhibiting potential

1049
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:34,200
for achievement are punished by both

1050
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:36,440
women and men the fear of success is

1051
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:38,839
quite rational when one knows that the

1052
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:41,079
consequence of achievement is hostility

1053
00:44:38,839 --> 00:44:43,880
and not praise so at no point in this

1054
00:44:41,079 --> 00:44:46,200
essay does Joe Freeman use the word envy

1055
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:49,720
but as usual Envy is right below the

1056
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:52,319
surface causing all the trouble so

1057
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:54,680
Freeman is describing how people from

1058
00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:57,240
marginalized groups whose ambition

1059
00:44:54,680 --> 00:45:00,119
raises them above the typical limits AC

1060
00:44:57,240 --> 00:45:02,000
by marginalization are often ostracized

1061
00:45:00,119 --> 00:45:04,119
from their own communities but she has

1062
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:06,200
no causal explanation for why this

1063
00:45:04,119 --> 00:45:08,559
happens I have an explanation the

1064
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:11,079
explanation is envy and women are more

1065
00:45:08,559 --> 00:45:13,000
likely to Envy other women trans women

1066
00:45:11,079 --> 00:45:15,559
are more likely to Envy other trans

1067
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:17,559
women oh God am I really going to go

1068
00:45:15,559 --> 00:45:21,400
there if we did this topic Justice this

1069
00:45:17,559 --> 00:45:24,559
video would be N9 centuries long on

1070
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:26,760
guard [ __ ] a lot of people assume that

1071
00:45:24,559 --> 00:45:28,760
trans women Envy CIS women and there is

1072
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:30,960
some truth to that there definitely was

1073
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:33,760
a time in my life when I used to Envy

1074
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:35,400
CIS women for being CIS women but now I

1075
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:37,520
kind of just don't even allow myself to

1076
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:40,720
have the thought what if I were a

1077
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:43,480
ciswoman so in a way because becoming a

1078
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:46,599
ciswoman is impossible it's unobtainable

1079
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:48,720
I actually Envy CIS women less so trans

1080
00:45:46,599 --> 00:45:50,680
women are more likely to Envy other

1081
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:53,720
trans women because of the proximity

1082
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:56,640
effect and because another transwoman

1083
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:59,599
represents an actual possibility of what

1084
00:45:56,640 --> 00:46:01,720
I a trans woman could become she's a

1085
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:03,800
standard to which I could plausibly

1086
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:06,200
compare myself here's a post someone

1087
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:07,880
made on my own fan subreddit am I the

1088
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:10,240
only one who finds it hard to watch

1089
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:12,040
trans creators before I realized I was a

1090
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:13,680
trans woman I [ __ ] loved people like

1091
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:15,720
Contra points Nix Speers and other trans

1092
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:18,079
creators but ever since I realized I was

1093
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:19,440
trans I just get this angry resentful

1094
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:21,440
feeling in the pit of my stomach

1095
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:23,960
whenever I get recommended any of these

1096
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:25,480
videos I seriously loved Contra points

1097
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:28,040
but whenever I try to watch any of her

1098
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:29,839
videos I just want to scream I have this

1099
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:32,079
feeling toward passing trans people in

1100
00:46:29,839 --> 00:46:34,720
general I feel such hatred for them and

1101
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:37,680
I don't know why am I just a toxic

1102
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:39,599
person well sweetie you're not a toxic

1103
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:41,960
person at least not any worse than

1104
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:44,160
anyone else it's just that human nature

1105
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:46,079
is a toxic person and that angry

1106
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:48,559
resentful feeling in the pit of your

1107
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:51,559
stomach that makes you want to scream

1108
00:46:48,559 --> 00:46:54,520
and feel such a hatred has a name and

1109
00:46:51,559 --> 00:46:56,079
the name is Envy I actually admire the

1110
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:57,800
person who wrote this post because

1111
00:46:56,079 --> 00:47:00,079
they're doing the best that any of us

1112
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:03,040
can do really which is noticing the

1113
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:05,119
feeling without endorsing the feeling I

1114
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:07,720
wish that more people could feel things

1115
00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:10,319
without rushing to a rational defense of

1116
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:12,200
the feeling it isn't rationality itself

1117
00:47:10,319 --> 00:47:14,280
often simply the attempt to make our

1118
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:16,440
feelings contagious sometimes people

1119
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:18,319
have no self-awareness about it at all

1120
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:21,079
for example there's a certain kind of uh

1121
00:47:18,319 --> 00:47:23,319
Boomer transsexual who complains that

1122
00:47:21,079 --> 00:47:25,839
when I transitioned I had to go through

1123
00:47:23,319 --> 00:47:28,200
rigorous Medical gatekeeping but kids

1124
00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:30,240
these days just BS on in and walk out

1125
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:33,359
with hormones it's intergenerational

1126
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:35,520
Envy trans Edition it was hard for me so

1127
00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:38,559
it should be hard for everyone like the

1128
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:41,240
student debt debate if I can't have it

1129
00:47:38,559 --> 00:47:43,359
no one can and look I do have sympathy

1130
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:47,240
and admiration for older trans people

1131
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:49,440
like being Trans in 2021 is already the

1132
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:51,760
maximum level of adversity that I can

1133
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:54,760
handle I cannot imagine how hard it was

1134
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:58,119
to do this in the80s however the pain of

1135
00:47:54,760 --> 00:48:00,559
Envy is not a valid argument Envy is not

1136
00:47:58,119 --> 00:48:03,440
sacred rage and the malignant demands of

1137
00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:06,200
envious people should be ignored God

1138
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:09,520
this community the constant competition

1139
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:11,079
the Envy the cringing it makes it really

1140
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:13,640
hard to get along with other trans

1141
00:48:11,079 --> 00:48:17,079
people oh speaking of which gay tangent

1142
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:19,760
everybody gay tangent Envy presents kind

1143
00:48:17,079 --> 00:48:22,280
of a unique problem to samesex attracted

1144
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:24,599
people because of the increased risk of

1145
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:28,079
envying the very people you're attracted

1146
00:48:24,599 --> 00:48:30,440
to I want to the ones I envy I envy you

1147
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:32,839
know it's the classic do I want you or

1148
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:34,760
do I want to be you problem I've heard

1149
00:48:32,839 --> 00:48:36,839
feminine queer women say they could

1150
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:39,079
never date another fem because they're

1151
00:48:36,839 --> 00:48:41,400
worried they would just end up envying

1152
00:48:39,079 --> 00:48:43,319
her so dating masculine women solves

1153
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:45,760
that problem because having separate

1154
00:48:43,319 --> 00:48:49,079
roles separate Aesthetics separate

1155
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:50,880
categories helps to avert proximity Envy

1156
00:48:49,079 --> 00:48:53,480
between partners

1157
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:56,400
unfortunately I am not that smart

1158
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:58,319
basically I am attracted to femininity

1159
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:01,079
but I also want to embody a kind of

1160
00:48:58,319 --> 00:49:02,920
feminine archetype myself I'm not

1161
00:49:01,079 --> 00:49:04,160
masculine and I don't want to be you

1162
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:06,240
know I used to think I'd only want to

1163
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:08,200
date another trans women because of the

1164
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:09,839
mutual understanding but I've kind of

1165
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:11,640
realized that at this point it may

1166
00:49:09,839 --> 00:49:13,680
actually be more psychologically healthy

1167
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:15,359
for me to open up to dating CIS women I

1168
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:16,760
used to not want to do that because I

1169
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:20,319
was afraid it would make me feel like a

1170
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:23,920
man but at this point honestly just be a

1171
00:49:20,319 --> 00:49:25,640
man whatever it's fine as a dry Queen

1172
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:27,319
once said I'm more of a man than you'll

1173
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:30,200
ever be and more more of a woman than

1174
00:49:27,319 --> 00:49:32,079
you'll ever have yes God can we get the

1175
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:35,000
tequila out of the frame please I think

1176
00:49:32,079 --> 00:49:37,520
at a distance it's okay to indulge the

1177
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:39,240
attraction emulation ambiguity but if

1178
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:41,400
you want to actually have a relationship

1179
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:43,880
with someone you have to make up your

1180
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:46,200
mind that you desire this woman and you

1181
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:48,040
do not want to be her because think

1182
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:50,280
about it from the other perspective what

1183
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:54,359
could be less attractive than someone

1184
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:56,760
who literally wants to be you teacher

1185
00:49:54,359 --> 00:49:59,240
make her stop copying me like as much as

1186
00:49:56,760 --> 00:50:02,319
I joke every episode about how Buffalo

1187
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:04,280
Bill is an iconique trans Legend you

1188
00:50:02,319 --> 00:50:07,280
don't want to date that [ __ ] imagine

1189
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:09,880
trying to date Eve from All About Eve

1190
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:12,040
pass hard pass so if you're a queer

1191
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:14,280
woman or a queer anything honestly and

1192
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:16,760
you find yourself envying your partner

1193
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:19,440
my advice is stop overthinking a good

1194
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:23,920
situation an enviable woman wanted to be

1195
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:27,200
with you so sit back relax and enjoy the

1196
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:28,599
clout I get it though it's it's comp at

1197
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:30,839
you know we're all supposed to proudly

1198
00:50:28,599 --> 00:50:33,520
affirm what we truly desire but how do

1199
00:50:30,839 --> 00:50:36,480
you know what you truly desire do I want

1200
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:41,880
mommy or do I want to be the

1201
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:44,280
mommy yes just yes anyway let's go back

1202
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:46,920
to talking about Sigman Freud the mother

1203
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:46,920
have took over

1204
00:50:52,559 --> 00:50:58,720
completely do I look okay is my head on

1205
00:50:55,640 --> 00:51:02,000
straight so we keep running into this

1206
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:04,359
avoidance of the word envy and people

1207
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:06,920
especially cannot seem to notice when

1208
00:51:04,359 --> 00:51:08,920
they themselves are feeling envious like

1209
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:10,760
that person who puzzled over the angry

1210
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:12,760
resentful feeling in the pit of their

1211
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:14,559
stomach without being able to name what

1212
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:16,240
they were feeling there's two reasons

1213
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:18,640
why people are usually in denial about

1214
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:22,319
their own Envy one is guilt and the

1215
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:24,160
other is shame shame shame because

1216
00:51:22,319 --> 00:51:26,599
admitting to yourself that you envy

1217
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:29,040
someone implies that you feel in

1218
00:51:26,599 --> 00:51:32,640
inferior to them which is shameful it

1219
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:34,960
wounds the ego and guilt because Envy is

1220
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:37,400
malicious if you envy someone you may

1221
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:39,480
feel angry and miserable about their

1222
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:42,000
success and good fortune and you may

1223
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:44,559
wish to see them ruined or brought down

1224
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:46,920
that's cruel and antisocial it goes

1225
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:49,079
against most ideas of morality and it's

1226
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:52,640
a thought that's usually not socially

1227
00:51:49,079 --> 00:51:55,520
acceptable to admit so Envy is shameful

1228
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:57,799
guilty and socially unacceptable and we

1229
00:51:55,520 --> 00:52:00,520
deal with that by suppressing it from

1230
00:51:57,799 --> 00:52:02,839
our awareness but it is still there and

1231
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:05,200
in order to maintain the denial we have

1232
00:52:02,839 --> 00:52:06,960
to convince ourselves that this angry

1233
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:09,960
resentful feeling in the pit of our

1234
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:12,760
stomach is actually something else think

1235
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:15,400
about how in SpongeBob Squidward shows

1236
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:17,640
contempt for SpongeBob's childishness

1237
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:21,040
for blowing bubbles for having fun at

1238
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:23,079
work when in fact Squidward envies

1239
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:25,640
SpongeBob's uninhibited joy and

1240
00:52:23,079 --> 00:52:27,400
intuitive creativity but he can't allow

1241
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:29,880
himself to have the thought that he

1242
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:32,480
envies SpongeBob because that would mean

1243
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:35,319
recognizing the intolerably shameful

1244
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:37,480
truth that he feels inferior to

1245
00:52:35,319 --> 00:52:39,599
SpongeBob so what he does instead is

1246
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:42,799
convince himself that what he really is

1247
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:45,240
is a refined sophisticate scoffing at

1248
00:52:42,799 --> 00:52:48,839
this childish fool how did I ever get

1249
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:51,480
surrounded by such loser

1250
00:52:48,839 --> 00:52:54,720
neighbors we could call this Envy to

1251
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:57,079
contempt sublimation sublimation is a

1252
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:59,839
psychoanalytic term which means that you

1253
00:52:57,079 --> 00:53:02,559
transform an ego wounding feeling or

1254
00:52:59,839 --> 00:53:04,480
socially unacceptable longing into

1255
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:06,480
something more ego flattering or

1256
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:08,480
socially acceptable so the classic

1257
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:11,640
example used by Freud is the

1258
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:14,559
transformation of sexual urges of erotic

1259
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:15,960
energy into creative expression it's

1260
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:18,799
like the founder of the noof fap

1261
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:20,839
movement Lady Gaga once said I have this

1262
00:53:18,799 --> 00:53:22,559
weird thing that if I sleep with someone

1263
00:53:20,839 --> 00:53:25,400
they're going to take my creativity from

1264
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:28,400
me through my uh so according to Freud

1265
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:31,079
the vast majority of erotic longings can

1266
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:34,319
never be fulfilled tell me about it

1267
00:53:31,079 --> 00:53:36,240
sigment misery uh but there's a positive

1268
00:53:34,319 --> 00:53:38,799
side to this supposedly which is that

1269
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:40,760
you can sublimate your erotic longings

1270
00:53:38,799 --> 00:53:42,720
into a more socially acceptable

1271
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:45,880
productivity so you know instead of

1272
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:48,000
flicking the bean maybe you write novels

1273
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:50,119
about thirsty vampires or for that

1274
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:52,880
matter philosophical treatises about the

1275
00:53:50,119 --> 00:53:54,920
will to power but we'll get to you Freud

1276
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:56,440
thought that Civilization itself is

1277
00:53:54,920 --> 00:53:58,200
built at the cost of our instin

1278
00:53:56,440 --> 00:54:00,799
instincts most of which we have to

1279
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:03,640
sacrifice in order to live in a society

1280
00:54:00,799 --> 00:54:05,839
so like erotic impulses I think Envy can

1281
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:08,640
be sublimated which is what's happening

1282
00:54:05,839 --> 00:54:11,079
when it becomes contempt another example

1283
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:13,079
is the blog mcmansion hell which makes

1284
00:54:11,079 --> 00:54:15,640
fun of the tasteless architecture of

1285
00:54:13,079 --> 00:54:18,160
suburban ostentatious trash I would

1286
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:21,240
argue that part of the fun of this blog

1287
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:23,920
is the pleasure and relief of looking

1288
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:26,960
down at the rich because looking

1289
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:29,480
enviously up at the rich is painful ful

1290
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:32,680
it makes you feel inferior and a way to

1291
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:35,079
alleviate that pain is to sublimate envy

1292
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:38,400
and pretend that you're an aristocratic

1293
00:54:35,079 --> 00:54:41,559
aete scoffing at the vulgar Taste of the

1294
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:45,119
arav eist these flying buttresses are an

1295
00:54:41,559 --> 00:54:47,160
extremely po taste another example is

1296
00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:49,319
shit-talking plastic surgery I once

1297
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:52,280
heard a trans woman say at least I don't

1298
00:54:49,319 --> 00:54:54,079
look like a botched sex doll the subtext

1299
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:56,599
is there's a certain kind of transwoman

1300
00:54:54,079 --> 00:54:58,480
influencer who lives in LA and has a lot

1301
00:54:56,599 --> 00:55:00,680
of cosmetic surgery to achieve a

1302
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:02,680
doll-like aesthetic but it costs a lot

1303
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:05,079
of money to look like this and a lot of

1304
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:06,960
trans women can't afford surgeries that

1305
00:55:05,079 --> 00:55:09,400
they want and one way to cope with

1306
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:11,119
frustrated desire is to convince

1307
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:14,200
yourself that the thing that's Out Of

1308
00:55:11,119 --> 00:55:16,359
Reach is not worth having anyway see

1309
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:18,240
also the discourse on Twitter about how

1310
00:55:16,359 --> 00:55:20,200
passing is transphobic there's an

1311
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:22,520
ancient Greek Fable where a fox wants

1312
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:24,680
some grapes but he can't reach the vine

1313
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:26,799
so he walks away bitterly and says well

1314
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:28,960
the grapes are transphobic anyway anyway

1315
00:55:26,799 --> 00:55:31,280
the cisgender version of this is maybe

1316
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:33,640
the not like other girls meme which is

1317
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:36,440
classic Envy to contempt sublimation the

1318
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:38,960
Trope is usually that other girls are

1319
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:41,240
popular and [ __ ] they have fake tans

1320
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:44,280
and fake nails they like partying and

1321
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:46,920
makeup and stupid music for idiots but

1322
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:49,880
I'm quirky and real I listen to Pink

1323
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:53,280
Floyd and read books and eat lots of

1324
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:55,520
pizza late at night alone and sad

1325
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:57,839
there's usually a subtext of anxiety

1326
00:55:55,520 --> 00:56:00,240
about inferior prity the other girls

1327
00:55:57,839 --> 00:56:02,520
being more socially accepted feminine

1328
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:04,880
and put together a lot of times the

1329
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:07,039
other girls don't even exist right

1330
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:08,839
they're a media construct of idealized

1331
00:56:07,039 --> 00:56:11,359
Womanhood like where are these other

1332
00:56:08,839 --> 00:56:13,319
girls who've never eaten pizza and enjoy

1333
00:56:11,359 --> 00:56:15,160
wearing makeup at 900 a.m. on a Saturday

1334
00:56:13,319 --> 00:56:17,039
morning are they between the sofa

1335
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:18,920
cushions did you put them in with the

1336
00:56:17,039 --> 00:56:20,960
other laundry are the other girls in the

1337
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:23,440
room with us right now so the feeling of

1338
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:25,599
inferiority toward the other girls is

1339
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:27,480
reframed as a kind of contemptuous

1340
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:29,960
hipster super superiority which is

1341
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:32,400
really just an ego defensive Persona of

1342
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:34,000
resentment like Janice in meain girls

1343
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:37,559
she's not even really a lesbian she's

1344
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:39,039
Lebanese Lebanese Regina got confused

1345
00:56:37,559 --> 00:56:41,720
and then she dances with a boy at the

1346
00:56:39,039 --> 00:56:43,799
end and is readmitted into girlhood uh

1347
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:46,920
thank you for that Tina Fe that's very

1348
00:56:43,799 --> 00:56:49,680
helpful great another way we can reframe

1349
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:53,079
feelings of envious inferiority is by

1350
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:56,039
transforming them into moral superiority

1351
00:56:53,079 --> 00:56:57,880
moral superiority often being The Refuge

1352
00:56:56,039 --> 00:56:59,920
of of people with nothing better to feel

1353
00:56:57,880 --> 00:57:02,680
Superior about we don't have to feel

1354
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:04,440
guilty or ashamed of Envy if we convince

1355
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:07,880
ourselves that what we're actually

1356
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:10,240
experiencing is Justified legitimate

1357
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:14,799
hatred so for example think of the

1358
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:16,440
morality around sexuality part 69 [ __ ]

1359
00:57:14,799 --> 00:57:18,880
yeah what are you going to do about it

1360
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:21,920
cancel me on

1361
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:24,039
guard [ __ ] why does everyone hate [ __ ]

1362
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:26,760
so much [ __ ] never did nothing wrong to

1363
00:57:24,039 --> 00:57:29,240
nobody open sexual promiscuity is in a

1364
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:31,400
way analogous to opulence you're

1365
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:33,880
conspicuously enjoying something that

1366
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:36,400
other people want but may not be able to

1367
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:38,720
get many cultures have Norms about

1368
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:40,680
modesty for example expecting women to

1369
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:43,319
cover their hair in public this is

1370
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:45,920
usually explained as prophylaxis against

1371
00:57:43,319 --> 00:57:49,079
male lust but I wonder if it also serves

1372
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:51,640
to prevent a more generalized Envy which

1373
00:57:49,079 --> 00:57:53,960
female Beauty has a way of attracting

1374
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:56,400
men often [ __ ] shame because they want

1375
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:59,160
to control female sexuality and by

1376
00:57:56,400 --> 00:58:00,920
female sexuality I do mean male

1377
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:03,119
sexuality because often what they're

1378
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:06,240
really struggling to control is their

1379
00:58:03,119 --> 00:58:09,000
own desire but [ __ ] shaming is also done

1380
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:11,079
pretty viciously by women to each other

1381
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:13,039
and that's a complicated thing it's more

1382
00:58:11,079 --> 00:58:15,200
than just Envy sometimes it comes from a

1383
00:58:13,039 --> 00:58:18,039
sense that a woman who's having casual

1384
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:20,440
sex with a lot of men is compromising

1385
00:58:18,039 --> 00:58:22,359
the collective sex withholding power of

1386
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:24,640
the group almost like she's crossing a

1387
00:58:22,359 --> 00:58:27,039
picket line but there's also sometimes a

1388
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:30,799
resentment that a woman who's showing

1389
00:58:27,039 --> 00:58:33,319
skin is using her body to get unearned

1390
00:58:30,799 --> 00:58:36,720
attention and that smells like Envy to

1391
00:58:33,319 --> 00:58:39,200
me I don't use my body to get attention

1392
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:41,680
so no one should the repressed feeling

1393
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:43,359
is maybe I'm a little jealous that she's

1394
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:46,039
getting all this attention by posting

1395
00:58:43,359 --> 00:58:50,440
thirst traps but you don't think that

1396
00:58:46,039 --> 00:58:55,240
you think I am above this because I am

1397
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:56,799
chased I have class I am a feminist I

1398
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:59,160
would also suggest a accusing her of

1399
00:58:56,799 --> 00:59:00,720
pandering to the male gaze that's of

1400
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:04,280
course the feminist way of calling

1401
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:06,720
someone a low down hob skank so again we

1402
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:10,680
have Envy to contempt sublimation and

1403
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:13,680
often the contempt is moral virtuous the

1404
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:17,039
psychological need to convince ourselves

1405
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:19,280
that Envy is morality can become so

1406
00:59:17,039 --> 00:59:21,839
strong that we actually start inventing

1407
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:24,119
things to be outraged about take for

1408
00:59:21,839 --> 00:59:26,200
instance the tendency to imagine that

1409
00:59:24,119 --> 00:59:29,319
the wealthy and Powerful are enjoying

1410
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:31,839
wild satanic orgies and indulging all

1411
00:59:29,319 --> 00:59:35,400
the Forbidden salacious Pleasures that

1412
00:59:31,839 --> 00:59:37,440
we ourselves are denied like qanon these

1413
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:40,280
conspiracy theorists who want us to

1414
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:43,039
imagine Hillary Clinton reclining in a

1415
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:45,319
Garden of Earthly Delights sampling the

1416
00:59:43,039 --> 00:59:49,160
pleasures of

1417
00:59:45,319 --> 00:59:51,319
aees live laugh love that for her Envy

1418
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:54,160
is very imaginative when it comes to the

1419
00:59:51,319 --> 00:59:56,319
hedonistic extravagance of the envied

1420
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:58,079
let's talk about Marie Antoinette the

1421
00:59:56,319 --> 01:00:00,160
queen of France who was guillotined by

1422
00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:02,359
the revolution if you know one thing

1423
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:03,920
about Marie Antoinette it's probably

1424
01:00:02,359 --> 01:00:06,720
that when she heard about a famine where

1425
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:09,160
the people had no bread she infamously

1426
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:12,240
responded let them eat

1427
01:00:09,160 --> 01:00:14,319
cake what an evil [ __ ] how could she

1428
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:18,039
say that

1429
01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:20,640
well she didn't she never said it it's a

1430
01:00:18,039 --> 01:00:23,000
lie the phrase let them eat cake

1431
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:25,200
originally let them eat Brios first

1432
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:28,680
appeared in Russo's confessions written

1433
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:31,760
in 177 65 when Marie Antoinette was 9

1434
01:00:28,680 --> 01:00:35,280
years old Russo attributed the line to a

1435
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:36,880
great princess probably no one ever said

1436
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:39,440
this it's kind of like how the most

1437
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:41,960
famous photo of Paris Hilton is the one

1438
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:45,079
where she's wearing a stop being poor

1439
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:48,480
t-shirt what an evil [ __ ] how could she

1440
01:00:45,079 --> 01:00:51,200
wear that well she didn't it's

1441
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:54,480
photoshopped the actual shirt said stop

1442
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:57,280
being desperate Envy likes to fabricate

1443
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:59,119
the Diabolical crime of its enemies I

1444
01:00:57,280 --> 01:01:01,200
assume to compliment the helenistic

1445
01:00:59,119 --> 01:01:03,400
extravagance I mean what is a Disney

1446
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:05,880
villain if not an opulent homosexual

1447
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:07,720
seen Through The Eyes of the envious see

1448
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:11,119
how I do I'm going to try lowering the

1449
01:01:07,720 --> 01:01:13,200
iso cuz it's so bright in here now okay

1450
01:01:11,119 --> 01:01:14,839
well it's a much lower ISO what if I get

1451
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:16,559
another light over here that's what this

1452
01:01:14,839 --> 01:01:18,960
channel is really about one biological

1453
01:01:16,559 --> 01:01:21,400
female's quest to create a harmonious

1454
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:23,760
color story in the Years leading up to

01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:26,400
and during the French Revolution Marie

1456
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:29,680
Antoinette was constantly defamed in

1457
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:31,720
these sleazy tabloids called libel is

1458
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:34,319
the same route as the English word liel

1459
01:01:31,720 --> 01:01:36,799
the often pornographic libel depicted

1460
01:01:34,319 --> 01:01:38,920
the queen as a bisexual demon who was

1461
01:01:36,799 --> 01:01:40,680
constantly having drunken orgies and

1462
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:43,559
sexually manipulating everyone around

1463
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:46,319
her all of which is very interesting but

1464
01:01:43,559 --> 01:01:48,960
none of which is true the historian

1465
01:01:46,319 --> 01:01:51,680
Robert Daron called it an avalanche of

1466
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:54,279
defamation that has no parallel in the

1467
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:57,640
history of vilification this woman took

1468
01:01:54,279 --> 01:02:00,240
the blame the moral blame for the

1469
01:01:57,640 --> 01:02:02,160
structural failings of a broken economic

1470
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:04,559
system and by the time she was brought

1471
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:07,760
before the Revolutionary tribunal in

1472
01:02:04,559 --> 01:02:10,039
1793 the actual person Marie Antoinette

1473
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:12,880
had long ago been overshadowed by the

1474
01:02:10,039 --> 01:02:15,279
lialis caricature of her now there was

1475
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:16,839
maybe one good reason for executing the

1476
01:02:15,279 --> 01:02:19,520
former Queen which is that the

1477
01:02:16,839 --> 01:02:22,079
legitimacy of your new Republic is a

1478
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:24,440
little more secure when you don't have

1479
01:02:22,079 --> 01:02:26,079
living monarchs hanging around someone

1480
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:28,000
better tell the English but the the

1481
01:02:26,079 --> 01:02:30,079
problem with that reasoning is it has

1482
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:33,200
nothing to do with whether or not the

1483
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:35,440
queen deserved to die and beheading a

1484
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:38,000
recently widowed mother of two in front

1485
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:40,279
of a jeering crowd for political

1486
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:42,480
expediency might weigh a little heavy on

1487
01:02:40,279 --> 01:02:44,440
the conscience so the revolution had to

1488
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:47,119
convince themselves that the queen

1489
01:02:44,440 --> 01:02:50,279
deserved it which was pretty easy after

1490
01:02:47,119 --> 01:02:52,359
Decades of again false and defamatory

1491
01:02:50,279 --> 01:02:55,480
gossip in her biography of mar

1492
01:02:52,359 --> 01:02:57,799
Antoinette Antonia Frasier describes how

1493
01:02:55,480 --> 01:03:00,240
the prison guards separated Marie from

1494
01:02:57,799 --> 01:03:02,839
her 8-year-old son who they plied with

1495
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:06,000
alcohol and groomed into accusing his

1496
01:03:02,839 --> 01:03:08,760
own mother of incestuous abuse to

1497
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:11,880
justify killing Marie Antoinette they

1498
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:14,200
had to destroy the idea of this woman as

1499
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:16,319
a mother so she was convicted of what

1500
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:18,880
may as well have been crimes against

1501
01:03:16,319 --> 01:03:21,319
ethics in games journalism and sent to

1502
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:24,119
the guillotine where her last words were

1503
01:03:21,319 --> 01:03:25,960
sorry to the Executioner for stepping on

1504
01:03:24,119 --> 01:03:29,079
his foot

1505
01:03:25,960 --> 01:03:31,279
uh women stop apologizing challenge this

1506
01:03:29,079 --> 01:03:34,119
is what a girl boss winning looks like

1507
01:03:31,279 --> 01:03:38,359
so Marie Antoinette literally did

1508
01:03:34,119 --> 01:03:41,160
nothing wrong hey how are you an

1509
01:03:38,359 --> 01:03:45,079
innocent mil was killed that day and die

1510
01:03:41,160 --> 01:03:47,920
for one won't stand for it so look we

1511
01:03:45,079 --> 01:03:50,400
have a psychological incentive to

1512
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:52,920
believe that people whom we Envy are

1513
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:54,839
immoral monsters because then we get to

1514
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:56,279
label our hatred and violence toward

1515
01:03:54,839 --> 01:03:59,119
them Justice

1516
01:03:56,279 --> 01:04:01,920
cruelty generally cannot conceptualize

1517
01:03:59,119 --> 01:04:04,599
itself as cruelty and part of the reason

1518
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:08,039
for that is that calling cruelty what it

1519
01:04:04,599 --> 01:04:10,559
is takes the fun out of it it reminds me

1520
01:04:08,039 --> 01:04:13,920
of the second best day in the history of

1521
01:04:10,559 --> 01:04:17,000
Twitter October 1st 2020 the day that

1522
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:19,599
Trump got Co and I'm going to be honest

1523
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:23,520
I have never felt more shot in Fuda in

1524
01:04:19,599 --> 01:04:25,760
my entire life well well well if it

1525
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:28,110
isn't the leopards eating people's faces

1526
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:34,750
party having their faces eaten by

1527
01:04:28,110 --> 01:04:34,750
[Music]

1528
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:39,839
leopards let's him eat cake like Dan

1529
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:42,440
Savage said it felt like Ronald Reagan

1530
01:04:39,839 --> 01:04:44,079
got AIDS the next day I tweeted these

1531
01:04:42,440 --> 01:04:46,440
last 24 hours have been the first time

1532
01:04:44,079 --> 01:04:48,039
I've genuinely enjoyed Twitter in years

1533
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:50,200
because this website is good for one

1534
01:04:48,039 --> 01:04:52,599
thing only reveling in the Cru list of

1535
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:55,319
human impulses and someone responded to

1536
01:04:52,599 --> 01:04:58,520
that saying oh my God could you even be

1537
01:04:55,319 --> 01:05:00,160
a killjoy but why was I being a killjoy

1538
01:04:58,520 --> 01:05:03,440
the Tweet was about how much I was

1539
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:06,279
enjoying it well for most people I guess

1540
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:08,640
not me but for normal people for other

1541
01:05:06,279 --> 01:05:10,279
girls cruelty is only pleasurable as

1542
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:12,920
long as they can convince themselves

1543
01:05:10,279 --> 01:05:17,000
it's something other than cruelty justce

1544
01:05:12,920 --> 01:05:19,000
served so again reason rationality are

1545
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:22,079
often the attempt to publicly

1546
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:26,039
communicate to evangelize our private

1547
01:05:22,079 --> 01:05:29,119
feelings and morality ethics and justice

1548
01:05:26,039 --> 01:05:32,599
are often put forward as the respectable

1549
01:05:29,119 --> 01:05:35,680
public face of private envy

1550
01:05:32,599 --> 01:05:38,520
vindictiveness and hatred but is this a

1551
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:40,799
Corruption of morality or have we

1552
01:05:38,520 --> 01:05:44,599
stumbled onto something darker what if

1553
01:05:40,799 --> 01:05:47,640
morality itself is simply the expression

1554
01:05:44,599 --> 01:05:50,319
of some kind of sedom masochistic

1555
01:05:47,640 --> 01:05:52,559
urge it's too early for this I mean it's

1556
01:05:50,319 --> 01:05:53,920
literally 700 a.m. where I'm filming I

1557
01:05:52,559 --> 01:05:55,640
don't know how this keeps happening to

1558
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:57,400
me my head gets cut off one after

1559
01:05:55,640 --> 01:06:00,160
afternoon puts me in a philosophical

1560
01:05:57,400 --> 01:06:01,440
mood the next morning I I've stayed up

1561
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:03,559
all night and I'm still talking about

1562
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:03,559
the

1563
01:06:03,839 --> 01:06:10,039
philosop meow meow hello again kittens

1564
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:14,119
let's talk about Justice ooo I look like

1565
01:06:10,039 --> 01:06:15,960
a Supreme Court Justice son so meow it

1566
01:06:14,119 --> 01:06:19,200
would actually be fierce if I wasn't you

1567
01:06:15,960 --> 01:06:21,119
know I wasn't being meat look I've been

1568
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:23,640
seeing a lot of comments lately along

1569
01:06:21,119 --> 01:06:26,119
the lines of Natalie used to do serious

1570
01:06:23,640 --> 01:06:29,240
academic arguments now she only cares

1571
01:06:26,119 --> 01:06:31,079
about makeup all right you little shits

1572
01:06:29,240 --> 01:06:32,839

1574
01:06:32,839 --> 01:06:40,640

1575
01:06:35,720 --> 01:06:43,319
headache in the morning friederick n

1576
01:06:40,640 --> 01:06:45,319
friederick VH n do you mind if I call

1577
01:06:43,319 --> 01:06:47,680
you Fred Frederick was a German

1578
01:06:45,319 --> 01:06:50,039
philosopher who had a lot to say about

1579
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:51,279
envy and morality but before we get into

1580
01:06:50,039 --> 01:06:54,400
that I want to say a little bit about

1581
01:06:51,279 --> 01:06:56,160
his life because it's just very funny n

1582
01:06:54,400 --> 01:07:00,240
is famous for his concept of the Uber

1583
01:06:56,160 --> 01:07:02,760
MCH but Frederick sweet beautiful little

1584
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:05,039
Frederick uh he was not what most people

1585
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:08,160
think of as an Uber mench Frederick was

1586
01:07:05,039 --> 01:07:10,760
a chronically ill chronically in pain

1587
01:07:08,160 --> 01:07:12,960
nearly blind incel who probably slept

1588
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:18,599
with a prostitute once and got syphilis

1589
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:20,200
and and died life is funny sad but funny

1590
01:07:18,599 --> 01:07:22,799
in the introduction to Beyond Good and

1591
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:24,640
Evil the editor says though he prided

1592
01:07:22,799 --> 01:07:26,000
himself on being comfortable with women

1593
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:27,720
he does not seem to have have been very

1594
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:29,799
successful in establishing emotionally

1595
01:07:27,720 --> 01:07:31,039
satisfying relationships with them which

1596
01:07:29,799 --> 01:07:32,880
is hardly

1597
01:07:31,039 --> 01:07:34,839
surprising I love when the introduction

1598
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:37,880
to a book is just a brutal roast of the

1599
01:07:34,839 --> 01:07:40,079
author who wrote this Rolf Peter hman

1600
01:07:37,880 --> 01:07:42,839
you're killing it Rolf you're a Savage I

1601
01:07:40,079 --> 01:07:45,000
adore Frederick's books sold a dismal

1602
01:07:42,839 --> 01:07:46,960
number of copies in his lifetime what

1603
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:49,720
emerges is a picture of a totally

1604
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:52,079
isolated highly neurotic man who had to

1605
01:07:49,720 --> 01:07:55,720
try hard to avoid thinking of himself as

1606
01:07:52,079 --> 01:07:55,720
a complete failure

1607
01:07:55,839 --> 01:07:59,559
oh he was also doing huge doses of opium

1608
01:07:58,119 --> 01:08:01,559
relatable and writing himself

1609
01:07:59,559 --> 01:08:05,520
prescriptions for sleeping pills using

1610
01:08:01,559 --> 01:08:07,880
the name Dr n Dr n pretty sure I got a

1611
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:10,279
Xanax prescription from that guy once

1612
01:08:07,880 --> 01:08:12,000
behind a Dairy Queen n was also a failed

1613
01:08:10,279 --> 01:08:14,440
musician and was in love with the

1614
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:17,839
composer rard vogner's

1615
01:08:14,440 --> 01:08:19,440
wife the Virgin n Contra the Chad Vagner

1616
01:08:17,839 --> 01:08:22,400
you beta

1617
01:08:19,440 --> 01:08:24,719
[ __ ] why did I do that can we all agree

1618
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:26,480
that Catgirl n is by far the most cursed

1619
01:08:24,719 --> 01:08:28,279
thing I've ever done I just want to Mom

1620
01:08:26,480 --> 01:08:31,400
this guy honestly I don't even care that

1621
01:08:28,279 --> 01:08:33,480
he's a misogynist his misogyny is simply

1622
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:35,319
too sad to be offended by you know I

1623
01:08:33,480 --> 01:08:38,040
think it's interesting that a person

1624
01:08:35,319 --> 01:08:39,960
this pathetic can also be a genius whose

1625
01:08:38,040 --> 01:08:41,719
name will never die he's someone who had

1626
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:44,159
a lot of reason to be envious and

1627
01:08:41,719 --> 01:08:46,600
self-pitying but his philosophy couldn't

1628
01:08:44,159 --> 01:08:48,600
be more against that and as a person of

1629
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:51,120
pathetic experience myself that is

1630
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:54,000
unironically kind of inspiring to me so

1631
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:56,839
let's go in in his book on the genealogy

1632
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:59,679
of morality Fred R wants to explain the

1633
01:08:56,839 --> 01:09:01,759
origin of the concepts of Good and Evil

1634
01:08:59,679 --> 01:09:03,839
under what conditions did man invent the

1635
01:09:01,759 --> 01:09:06,080
value judgments good and evil and what

1636
01:09:03,839 --> 01:09:08,159
value do they themselves have have they

1637
01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:10,480
to now obstructed or promoted human

1638
01:09:08,159 --> 01:09:12,440
flourishing hang on my Foods here that's

1639
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:13,600
right you're getting a mukbong sweetie

1640
01:09:12,440 --> 01:09:15,440
did you think I was going to sit at this

1641
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:16,560
giant table and not be eating something

1642
01:09:15,440 --> 01:09:18,319
this video has been going on more than

1643
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:19,920
an hour so I assume you guys are drunk

1644
01:09:18,319 --> 01:09:21,640
by now and we're just kind of hanging

1645
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:24,480
out at this point you guys can't even

1646
01:09:21,640 --> 01:09:26,080
see well here I've got a bunch of sushi

1647
01:09:24,480 --> 01:09:28,040
and it's my mission to eat all of this

1648
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:30,359
while summarizing the entire life and

1649
01:09:28,040 --> 01:09:32,839
work of friederick n Trisha Pedas

1650
01:09:30,359 --> 01:09:35,560
nikocado consider this a challenge so

1651
01:09:32,839 --> 01:09:36,920
Frederick argues that good and bad not

1652
01:09:35,560 --> 01:09:39,880
good and evil that's different we'll get

1653
01:09:36,920 --> 01:09:42,719
to that but good and bad were originally

1654
01:09:39,880 --> 01:09:46,000
the self-affirming values of people with

1655
01:09:42,719 --> 01:09:48,960
power so to be good meant to be powerful

1656
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:53,400
strong beautiful healthy and to be bad

1657
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:55,920
meant to be weak sick common ugly want

1658
01:09:53,400 --> 01:09:58,040
to eat one like a cat

1659
01:09:55,920 --> 01:10:00,280
and Frederick supports this speculation

1660
01:09:58,040 --> 01:10:02,239
with atmology so in a lot of languages

1661
01:10:00,280 --> 01:10:05,239
the word that means morally good or

1662
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:07,159
spiritually Noble originally meant Noble

1663
01:10:05,239 --> 01:10:10,640
in the sense of aristocratic the

1664
01:10:07,159 --> 01:10:13,600
property class like in Buddhism the Arya

1665
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:16,920
saani that's Sanskrit for Noble Truths

1666
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:19,159
Arya means Noble and Arya is used to

1667
01:10:16,920 --> 01:10:21,719
mean spiritually Noble but earlier it

1668
01:10:19,159 --> 01:10:23,199
meant the aristocracy the rich and

1669
01:10:21,719 --> 01:10:25,000
originally it was just the name that a

1670
01:10:23,199 --> 01:10:25,840
culture in Northern India gave

1671
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:28,360
themselves

1672
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:30,320
the Aryans I'm really working not to get

1673
01:10:28,360 --> 01:10:33,080
soy sauce on this lace This was later

1674
01:10:30,320 --> 01:10:36,040
misunderstood by Europeans who wrongly

1675
01:10:33,080 --> 01:10:40,560
thought that Aryan Was a

1676
01:10:36,040 --> 01:10:43,080
Race oops God damn it God damn it kids

1677
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:45,440
can we not Frederick traces the origin

1678
01:10:43,080 --> 01:10:48,280
of the German word gut or the English

1679
01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:50,679
good to the name of the Goths no not

1680
01:10:48,280 --> 01:10:52,960
those Goths the Scandinavian people who

1681
01:10:50,679 --> 01:10:56,159
invaded Europe Frederick calls them the

1682
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:59,480
blonde beasts of prey I like to stalk my

1683
01:10:56,159 --> 01:11:02,000
prey in the small hours of the night M

1684
01:10:59,480 --> 01:11:05,120
the German word SCH which means bad is

1685
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:08,960
related to SCH which means plain simple

1686
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:11,920
originally common low not aristocratic

1687
01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:13,640
not Noble so good and bad were

1688
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:16,520
originally the values of warrior

1689
01:11:13,640 --> 01:11:18,719
Aristocrats who were like homeric Heroes

1690
01:11:16,520 --> 01:11:21,920
celebrating themselves and Frederick

1691
01:11:18,719 --> 01:11:25,360
calls their value system Master morality

1692
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:29,280
this glorification of combat feasting a

1693
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:31,560
athleticism sexual Conquest Beauty the

1694
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:34,719
things were called good and their

1695
01:11:31,560 --> 01:11:36,960
opposites weakness impotence ugliness

1696
01:11:34,719 --> 01:11:39,400
were called bad the ancient Nobles

1697
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:41,280
worshiped Noble Gods who acted like them

1698
01:11:39,400 --> 01:11:43,120
and shared their values I mean if I

1699
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:44,880
created a personal goddess I think we

1700
01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:46,639
all know what animal that would be me

1701
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:49,360
and the ancient Egyptians on the same

1702
01:11:46,639 --> 01:11:51,920
page so for example Roman Warriors could

1703
01:11:49,360 --> 01:11:53,800
worship Mars the god of war and it was

1704
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:56,000
like they were worshiping themselves

1705
01:11:53,800 --> 01:11:58,280
they were dumb jocks worshiping Dum jock

1706
01:11:56,000 --> 01:12:01,000
Gods well good for them but what about

1707
01:11:58,280 --> 01:12:03,360
the people who got shoved into lockers

1708
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:05,239
well Frederick's example and this is

1709
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:08,639
going to create some misunderstandings

1710
01:12:05,239 --> 01:12:11,520
later but his example is the Jews who

1711
01:12:08,639 --> 01:12:13,239
are colonized by the Romans in Judea and

1712
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:17,639
it's certainly not that the Jews didn't

1713
01:12:13,239 --> 01:12:19,360
try to revolt oh they did multiple times

1714
01:12:17,639 --> 01:12:21,679
but for several centuries the Romans

1715
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:24,159
were just too powerful no one could stop

1716
01:12:21,679 --> 01:12:26,000
them so the question is what happens

1717
01:12:24,159 --> 01:12:28,040
psychologically to people who are

1718
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:30,719
oppressed and who lack the power to

1719
01:12:28,040 --> 01:12:33,440
overthrow the oppressor well in that

1720
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:36,320
case frustrated vindictiveness builds

1721
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:39,639
over time to become this deep bitterness

1722
01:12:36,320 --> 01:12:42,600
which n gave the French name res

1723
01:12:39,639 --> 01:12:44,760
resentment in English

1724
01:12:42,600 --> 01:12:47,159
we

1725
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:50,560
absolute I don't speak French I just

1726
01:12:47,159 --> 01:12:50,560
enjoy making vaguely French

1727
01:12:51,880 --> 01:12:55,320
noises I don't like the English but I

1728
01:12:53,920 --> 01:12:56,600
like the French even less because

1729
01:12:55,320 --> 01:12:59,040
they're always dressed so well and they

1730
01:12:56,600 --> 01:13:00,960
speak a sexier language than me stop it

1731
01:12:59,040 --> 01:13:02,360
this is your final warning comu good

1732
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:05,760
wine though I'll give them that so

1733
01:13:02,360 --> 01:13:07,840
there's a German word n which means Envy

1734
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:11,159
so why is Frederick using this French

1735
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:13,679
term rant what's going on Frederick why

1736
01:13:11,159 --> 01:13:15,679
you speaking French are you nervous

1737
01:13:13,679 --> 01:13:17,920
you're trying to impress me n must have

1738
01:13:15,679 --> 01:13:19,840
said ranti because he thought it was

1739
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:21,800
something different than Envy I think

1740
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:22,960
the difference is resentment and I'm

1741
01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:25,120
just going to use the English word so I

1742
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:27,719
don't sound like an [ __ ] resentment

1743
01:13:25,120 --> 01:13:30,719
is born not just of wanting what someone

1744
01:13:27,719 --> 01:13:33,120
has but of a permanent frustration of

1745
01:13:30,719 --> 01:13:36,400
the desire for Revenge it's born of

1746
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:39,360
weakness inability to get revenge now

1747
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:41,960
Revenge itself implies weakness at least

1748
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:45,320
a temporary weakness we say revenge is

1749
01:13:41,960 --> 01:13:49,080
best served cold but actually revenge is

1750
01:13:45,320 --> 01:13:50,800
only served cold if it's served hot if

1751
01:13:49,080 --> 01:13:54,040
someone slaps you and you slap them back

1752
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:56,880
immediately that's retaliation not

1753
01:13:54,040 --> 01:13:58,920
Revenge you brought this on yourself

1754
01:13:56,880 --> 01:14:01,239
revenge is only a possibility when you

1755
01:13:58,920 --> 01:14:03,440
can't retaliate immediately so you

1756
01:14:01,239 --> 01:14:05,960
become vindictive you start plotting and

1757
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:08,880
scheming but if you're too weak too

1758
01:14:05,960 --> 01:14:10,840
impotent to have any hope of Revenge

1759
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:12,880
then you become resentful so n's

1760
01:14:10,840 --> 01:14:16,159
argument is that a person who's too weak

1761
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:19,120
to get material Revenge can instead get

1762
01:14:16,159 --> 01:14:21,400
psychological Revenge by creating a new

1763
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:23,600
Morality In Frederick's words the

1764
01:14:21,400 --> 01:14:26,000
beginning of the slaves revolt and

1765
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:28,639
morality occurs when

1766
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:30,800
itself turns creative and gives birth to

1767
01:14:28,639 --> 01:14:32,360
values this is a little high concept for

1768
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:34,600
a mukbang isn't it what are you doing

1769
01:14:32,360 --> 01:14:37,600
Frederick so while master morality says

1770
01:14:34,600 --> 01:14:40,719
that good is power riches health and

1771
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:43,159
strength and bad is the opposite slave

1772
01:14:40,719 --> 01:14:46,320
of morality the morality of resentment

1773
01:14:43,159 --> 01:14:49,639
says blessed are the poor the meek the

1774
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:51,880
sick the powerless this is the good of

1775
01:14:49,639 --> 01:14:55,400
slave morality and its opposite is not

1776
01:14:51,880 --> 01:14:58,199
the bad but A New Concept the evil and

1777
01:14:55,400 --> 01:15:02,239
what is evil well everything that Master

1778
01:14:58,199 --> 01:15:04,580
morality says is good power wealth

1779
01:15:02,239 --> 01:15:09,840
Conquest sexual

1780
01:15:04,580 --> 01:15:11,600
[Music]

1781
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:13,520
satisfaction he's talking about

1782
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:15,480
Christianity here he's not talking about

1783
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:18,199
Judaism but Frederick thinks of

1784
01:15:15,480 --> 01:15:21,040
Christianity as the spiritual revenge of

1785
01:15:18,199 --> 01:15:23,400
the Jews against the Romans an inversion

1786
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:25,000
of the Empire's values but he also

1787
01:15:23,400 --> 01:15:27,239
thinks that slave morality is

1788
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:30,040
fundamentally dishonest it's like the

1789
01:15:27,239 --> 01:15:32,960
fox and the grapes not being able to

1790
01:15:30,040 --> 01:15:35,400
take revenge is called not wanting to

1791
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:38,280
take revenge it might even be called

1792
01:15:35,400 --> 01:15:41,159
forgiveness slave of morality says that

1793
01:15:38,280 --> 01:15:44,159
weakness is righteous submission to

1794
01:15:41,159 --> 01:15:47,400
people you hate is called obedience

1795
01:15:44,159 --> 01:15:49,760
having to wait is called patience

1796
01:15:47,400 --> 01:15:53,440
inability to satisfy sexual desire is

1797
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:55,080
called Chastity Purity and so on and

1798
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:58,440
while master immorality is born of

1799
01:15:55,080 --> 01:16:02,000
saying yes to yourself as a powerful

1800
01:15:58,440 --> 01:16:04,760
Noble Beast of prey slay of morality is

1801
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:07,120
born of saying no to the master and

1802
01:16:04,760 --> 01:16:09,880
everything he has that you can't I like

1803
01:16:07,120 --> 01:16:11,800
to have my belly rubbed scratch my back

1804
01:16:09,880 --> 01:16:13,040
above my tail please I'm going to put

1805
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:14,880
the rest of the fish away because it's

1806
01:16:13,040 --> 01:16:16,560
getting warm and I'm full this has not

1807
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:18,320
been a successful mukbang it turns out

1808
01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:20,360
that it's actually very difficult to do

1809
01:16:18,320 --> 01:16:21,600
a mukbang while talking I should have

1810
01:16:20,360 --> 01:16:23,800
thought this through a little harder hm

1811
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:25,920
so slave morality is born of a repressed

1812
01:16:23,800 --> 01:16:28,320
desire for Revenge but that desire for

1813
01:16:25,920 --> 01:16:30,159
Revenge never completely disappears it's

1814
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:31,520
there for example in the Christian idea

1815
01:16:30,159 --> 01:16:34,000
of the last

1816
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:36,400
judgment no need to take revenge against

1817
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:37,719
the wicked my sheep God will do that for

1818
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:42,320
us and in the

1819
01:16:37,719 --> 01:16:44,159
meantime being weak is good actually I

1820
01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:46,679
find this book thrilling to read

1821
01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:49,040
honestly and I'm not easily thrilled

1822
01:16:46,679 --> 01:16:51,239
especially not by philosophers I think

1823
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:53,040
this book in particular gets me because

1824
01:16:51,239 --> 01:16:55,520
especially if you a raised Christian

1825
01:16:53,040 --> 01:16:57,000
this is so the opposite of everything

1826
01:16:55,520 --> 01:17:00,040
you were ever taught to believe that it

1827
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:02,480
almost feels like dirty should I be

1828
01:17:00,040 --> 01:17:04,639
reading this is this allowed cuz even if

1829
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:06,719
you're not religious most of us still

1830
01:17:04,639 --> 01:17:09,600
agree with a lot of Christian morality

1831
01:17:06,719 --> 01:17:12,000
like yeah Jesus was a good guy blessed

1832
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:14,920
are the meek sure but then Frederick

1833
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:16,520
comes along and he's like morality is

1834
01:17:14,920 --> 01:17:18,560
just a cope for frustrated

1835
01:17:16,520 --> 01:17:23,280
vindictiveness and you're like I need to

1836
01:17:18,560 --> 01:17:23,280
lie down where's my smelling salt

1837
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:31,879
[Music]

1838
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:36,560
but wait there's more this gets even

1839
01:17:34,639 --> 01:17:38,880
darker n thinks that over the last two

1840
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:41,560
Millennia of European history slave

1841
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:43,920
morality has triumphed St Paul made

1842
01:17:41,560 --> 01:17:46,360
Christianity marketable the emperor

1843
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:49,000
Constantine converted and by the Middle

1844
01:17:46,360 --> 01:17:51,320
Ages even Kings and Aristocrats were

1845
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:53,800
kneeling down not to powerful Warrior

1846
01:17:51,320 --> 01:17:55,920
gods made in their own image but to a

1847
01:17:53,800 --> 01:17:57,520
god that was weak

1848
01:17:55,920 --> 01:17:59,880
suffering

1849
01:17:57,520 --> 01:18:02,600
victimized

1850
01:17:59,880 --> 01:18:05,560
oppressed so by the 19th century slave

1851
01:18:02,600 --> 01:18:07,600
morality had become the only morality

1852
01:18:05,560 --> 01:18:09,760
and it's not just Christianity either

1853
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:12,840
the secular version of these values

1854
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:15,800
became socialism anarchism about freeth

1855
01:18:12,840 --> 01:18:18,880
thinkers and atheists Nija has this to

1856
01:18:15,800 --> 01:18:21,440
say we loathe the church not its poison

1857
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:24,800
apart from the church we too love the

1858
01:18:21,440 --> 01:18:27,360
poison okay the poison what is the PO

1859
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:30,080
poison well Frederick thinks that

1860
01:18:27,360 --> 01:18:32,800
resentment poisons the mind and turns

1861
01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:35,239
humans against our own Natural Instincts

1862
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:38,880
not just against aggression but against

1863
01:18:35,239 --> 01:18:41,159
sexuality against ambition against power

1864
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:43,719
against life itself and there's two

1865
01:18:41,159 --> 01:18:46,280
possible outcomes of this one is that

1866
01:18:43,719 --> 01:18:48,840
resentment becomes a political movement

1867
01:18:46,280 --> 01:18:51,639
the conspiracy of those who suffer the

1868
01:18:48,840 --> 01:18:54,560
tyranny of the herd the revolution that

1869
01:18:51,639 --> 01:18:57,120
eats itself only we are good and just is

1870
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:59,400
what they say as though Health success

1871
01:18:57,120 --> 01:19:01,880
strength pride and the feeling of power

1872
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:04,120
were in themselves depravities for which

1873
01:19:01,880 --> 01:19:06,400
Penance bitter Penance will one day be

1874
01:19:04,120 --> 01:19:09,320
exacted among them we find plenty of

1875
01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:11,239
Vengeance Seekers disguised as judges

1876
01:19:09,320 --> 01:19:13,800
with the word justice Contin in their

1877
01:19:11,239 --> 01:19:15,840
mouth like poisonous spittle so you get

1878
01:19:13,800 --> 01:19:17,719
the mentality of a hyperm moralistic

1879
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:20,000
resentment mob which I'm sure we're all

1880
01:19:17,719 --> 01:19:22,880
familiar with the other outcome is that

1881
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:25,400
this moralism turns inward and attacks

1882
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:26,960
the individual conscience producing

1883
01:19:25,400 --> 01:19:29,719
aestheticism

1884
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:32,280
self-denial guilt because slave morality

1885
01:19:29,719 --> 01:19:35,280
condemns not only the external beasts of

1886
01:19:32,280 --> 01:19:38,080
prey who are oppressing us but also the

1887
01:19:35,280 --> 01:19:41,840
Beast of prey within our own animal

1888
01:19:38,080 --> 01:19:44,080
instincts what Christianity calls sin so

1889
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:47,360
Frederick thinks that modern humans have

1890
01:19:44,080 --> 01:19:50,880
become sick we hate ourselves we hate

1891
01:19:47,360 --> 01:19:53,880
our own nature we hate life itself I

1892
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:55,320
mean is he wrong you see a girl boss

1893
01:19:53,880 --> 01:19:57,880
winning

1894
01:19:55,320 --> 01:20:00,800
I only see the will to power Frederick

1895
01:19:57,880 --> 01:20:03,280
thinks of Modern Men as once proud wild

1896
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:06,239
cats who've become domesticated house

1897
01:20:03,280 --> 01:20:10,560
pets at the cost of everything great in

1898
01:20:06,239 --> 01:20:15,120
the human Spirit that's very valid

1899
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:17,000
fredric that's super hecking valid so

1900
01:20:15,120 --> 01:20:19,080
look I've been pretty positive about n

1901
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:21,679
so far but I do have a couple critiques

1902
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:24,480
I want to say one is that Frederick

1903
01:20:21,679 --> 01:20:26,639
associating slave morality with the Jews

1904
01:20:24,480 --> 01:20:28,520
is is very irresponsible even though he

1905
01:20:26,639 --> 01:20:30,080
didn't intend to be anti-semitic and

1906
01:20:28,520 --> 01:20:32,040
even though he was outspoken against

1907
01:20:30,080 --> 01:20:34,120
anti-Semitism in his own time when you

1908
01:20:32,040 --> 01:20:36,880
keep referring to the Christian values

1909
01:20:34,120 --> 01:20:39,760
you're critiquing as Jewish hatred and

1910
01:20:36,880 --> 01:20:42,199
Jewish Revenge some people might get the

1911
01:20:39,760 --> 01:20:44,880
wrong idea and some people did Frederick

1912
01:20:42,199 --> 01:20:48,400
like your dumbass sister Elizabeth n who

1913
01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:50,679
became a literal alternative ethno

1914
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:53,400
identitarian God damn it Liz kind of

1915
01:20:50,679 --> 01:20:55,239
goth goals though yes that kind of goth

1916
01:20:53,400 --> 01:20:56,600
you're right this time my other critique

1917
01:20:55,239 --> 01:20:58,960
is that it doesn't seem to have occurred

1918
01:20:56,600 --> 01:21:01,239
to Frederick that genuinely caring about

1919
01:20:58,960 --> 01:21:02,880
other people is an option like not

1920
01:21:01,239 --> 01:21:05,360
because caring about other people is

1921
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:07,400
repressing your true selfish nature but

1922
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:10,120
just because caring about other people

1923
01:21:07,400 --> 01:21:12,239
is part of your nature and isn't it

1924
01:21:10,120 --> 01:21:14,679
isn't caring about other people also in

1925
01:21:12,239 --> 01:21:16,719
our nature I do think most of what n

1926
01:21:14,679 --> 01:21:19,719
says about resentment accurately

1927
01:21:16,719 --> 01:21:22,520
describes a very real thing but it's not

1928
01:21:19,719 --> 01:21:24,639
the only thing there is genuine care and

1929
01:21:22,520 --> 01:21:26,639
love in this world I've been told I

1930
01:21:24,639 --> 01:21:29,480
heard rumors and I'm even going to go so

1931
01:21:26,639 --> 01:21:31,120
far as to say # notall Christians Christ

1932
01:21:29,480 --> 01:21:32,800
I'm defending the Christians what is

1933
01:21:31,120 --> 01:21:36,120
this channel coming to there are

1934
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:38,360
Christians maybe not most but still some

1935
01:21:36,120 --> 01:21:40,920
for whom love and forgiveness are

1936
01:21:38,360 --> 01:21:44,040
genuine experiences and not just some

1937
01:21:40,920 --> 01:21:46,199
kind of Twisted impotent passive

1938
01:21:44,040 --> 01:21:49,280
aggressive Vengeance where I agree with

1939
01:21:46,199 --> 01:21:52,440
n and with Freud is I do think a lot of

1940
01:21:49,280 --> 01:21:55,239
the emotional Foundation of justice and

1941
01:21:52,440 --> 01:21:58,199
morality is retribution

1942
01:21:55,239 --> 01:22:00,080
Envy or some combination of the two but

1943
01:21:58,199 --> 01:22:01,639
maybe it doesn't have to be that way

1944
01:22:00,080 --> 01:22:03,920
there's a famous Martin Luther King

1945
01:22:01,639 --> 01:22:07,719
quote responding to Nature what is

1946
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:10,400
needed is a realization that power

1947
01:22:07,719 --> 01:22:13,280
without love is reckless and abusive and

1948
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:17,679
that love without power is sentimental

1949
01:22:13,280 --> 01:22:20,679
anonym power at its best is love

1950
01:22:17,679 --> 01:22:24,000
implementing the demands of Justice and

1951
01:22:20,679 --> 01:22:26,600
Justice at its best is love correcting

1952
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:30,320
everything that stands against

1953
01:22:26,600 --> 01:22:34,080
love so Reverend King concedes to n that

1954
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:36,159
to Simply call power evil is a sickness

1955
01:22:34,080 --> 01:22:38,560
anemic but there still needs to be some

1956
01:22:36,159 --> 01:22:40,560
kind of emotional or spiritual force

1957
01:22:38,560 --> 01:22:43,000
that keeps Humanity from tearing itself

1958
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:45,199
apart and maybe something like this

1959
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:46,880
Christian idea of love for Humanity is

1960
01:22:45,199 --> 01:22:48,840
the missing peace because without

1961
01:22:46,880 --> 01:22:51,760
something like that I just see

1962
01:22:48,840 --> 01:22:54,040
retribution and envy snowballing into

1963
01:22:51,760 --> 01:22:56,560
human self-destruction and I hate that

1964
01:22:54,040 --> 01:22:58,239
for us it's not very sliving of us do

1965
01:22:56,560 --> 01:22:59,880
you guys know about sliving do you even

1966
01:22:58,239 --> 01:23:01,040
subscribe to Paris Hilton's YouTube

1967
01:22:59,880 --> 01:23:03,239
channel she doesn't have as many

1968
01:23:01,040 --> 01:23:05,840
subscribers as I do but you know I try

1969
01:23:03,239 --> 01:23:08,080
to support smaller creators living is

1970
01:23:05,840 --> 01:23:10,679
basically slaying and living your best

1971
01:23:08,080 --> 01:23:12,440
life into one word it's the new that's T

1972
01:23:10,679 --> 01:23:15,760
maybe I'll do a video about love when

1973
01:23:12,440 --> 01:23:18,960
I'm in a better mood so for now well

1974
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:24,520
let's put it this way God is dead and we

1975
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:24,520
have killed him M it's living

1976
01:23:26,260 --> 01:23:38,170
[Music]

1977
01:23:39,320 --> 01:23:44,440
okay I'm moisturized I'm primed I've

1978
01:23:42,280 --> 01:23:46,159
proven my academic credentials now it's

1979
01:23:44,440 --> 01:23:48,600
time to do my makeup that's right

1980
01:23:46,159 --> 01:23:51,639
children I'm going full baileyan I'm

1981
01:23:48,600 --> 01:23:53,040
going full suspish so I guess I should

1982
01:23:51,639 --> 01:23:55,400
say something about the political

1983
01:23:53,040 --> 01:23:57,440
implications of all this since uh I

1984
01:23:55,400 --> 01:23:58,400
guess this channel is about politics

1985
01:23:57,440 --> 01:24:00,360
sometimes I have to read my own

1986
01:23:58,400 --> 01:24:02,639
Wikipedia article to remember what I'm

1987
01:24:00,360 --> 01:24:05,560
doing with my life so this morality of

1988
01:24:02,639 --> 01:24:09,800
resentment of impotence and permanently

1989
01:24:05,560 --> 01:24:11,800
frustrated Revenge judges that power is

1990
01:24:09,800 --> 01:24:13,600
evil I don't use Foundation I just use

1991
01:24:11,800 --> 01:24:15,040
concealer I know that's like not how

1992
01:24:13,600 --> 01:24:16,520
you're supposed to do makeup but I don't

1993
01:24:15,040 --> 01:24:18,600
need to be good at makeup okay I have a

1994
01:24:16,520 --> 01:24:20,400
million subscribers on YouTube I don't

1995
01:24:18,600 --> 01:24:22,000
need to be good there was a New York

1996
01:24:20,400 --> 01:24:23,960
Times article about young women's

1997
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:25,400
attitudes toward political ambition and

1998
01:24:23,960 --> 01:24:27,960
one of the women who was interviewed

1999
01:24:25,400 --> 01:24:30,400
said as a white woman I know I have

2000
01:24:27,960 --> 01:24:34,040
unearned privilege so am I really the

2001
01:24:30,400 --> 01:24:35,960
best person to be in leadership uh yes

2002
01:24:34,040 --> 01:24:38,560
yes you are because we need leaders like

2003
01:24:35,960 --> 01:24:40,480
you who are capable of questioning the

2004
01:24:38,560 --> 01:24:42,280
legitimacy of their own authority

2005
01:24:40,480 --> 01:24:44,600
otherwise we're just going to be stuck

2006
01:24:42,280 --> 01:24:46,440
with another blonde Beast of prey and of

2007
01:24:44,600 --> 01:24:48,800
course it's good to be aware of your

2008
01:24:46,440 --> 01:24:51,280
privilege especially as a leader but

2009
01:24:48,800 --> 01:24:53,560
let's not be so self effacing that we a

2010
01:24:51,280 --> 01:24:56,199
face ourselves off the face of the Earth

2011
01:24:53,560 --> 01:24:59,119
this is the self sabotage of resentment

2012
01:24:56,199 --> 01:25:00,920
values if you think power is evil then

2013
01:24:59,119 --> 01:25:02,880
you've given up on the ambition to

2014
01:25:00,920 --> 01:25:05,119
acquire any power which virtually

2015
01:25:02,880 --> 01:25:07,639
guarantees your political irrelevance

2016
01:25:05,119 --> 01:25:10,080
since like MLK said you have to at least

2017
01:25:07,639 --> 01:25:12,679
have some power to implement the demands

2018
01:25:10,080 --> 01:25:15,040
of Justice remember what incel is called

2019
01:25:12,679 --> 01:25:16,199
taking the black pill this conviction

2020
01:25:15,040 --> 01:25:17,760
that the reason you don't have a

2021
01:25:16,199 --> 01:25:19,760
girlfriend is just that you're

2022
01:25:17,760 --> 01:25:22,080
genetically undesirable there's nothing

2023
01:25:19,760 --> 01:25:23,840
you can do to change it and I guess

2024
01:25:22,080 --> 01:25:25,800
women are just too shallow to be

2025
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:28,119
attracted to all the amazing hatred and

2026
01:25:25,800 --> 01:25:30,159
spite that festers in your heart for a

2027
01:25:28,119 --> 01:25:32,080
lot of blackpilled incels it seems like

2028
01:25:30,159 --> 01:25:34,840
there's only one thing left in life that

2029
01:25:32,080 --> 01:25:38,000
they enjoy which is simply the pleasure

2030
01:25:34,840 --> 01:25:40,080
of complaining of Moaning in pain it

2031
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:43,040
reminds me of a comment from

2032
01:25:40,080 --> 01:25:45,360
dov's second most horrible protagonist

2033
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:46,719
even in toothache there is enjoyment in

2034
01:25:45,360 --> 01:25:48,840
that case of course people are not

2035
01:25:46,719 --> 01:25:50,719
spiteful in silence but moan but they

2036
01:25:48,840 --> 01:25:52,639
are not candid moans they are malignant

2037
01:25:50,719 --> 01:25:56,080
moans and the malignancy is the whole

2038
01:25:52,639 --> 01:25:58,600
point the moan is a protest against the

2039
01:25:56,080 --> 01:26:01,400
meaninglessness of pain and part of the

2040
01:25:58,600 --> 01:26:04,000
satisfaction of Moaning is inflicting

2041
01:26:01,400 --> 01:26:06,480
your pain on other people this kind of

2042
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:09,000
malignant moaning it's kind of the

2043
01:26:06,480 --> 01:26:11,840
opposite of music because a lot of music

2044
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:14,159
like Blues is benevolent moaning that

2045
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:15,800
transforms pain into pleasure I mean

2046
01:26:14,159 --> 01:26:17,520
that's what Blues is all about my woman

2047
01:26:15,800 --> 01:26:20,280
don't love me no more but I know her

2048
01:26:17,520 --> 01:26:22,360
sister will you know optimism I think a

2049
01:26:20,280 --> 01:26:24,520
lot of incel discourse is really just

2050
01:26:22,360 --> 01:26:27,400
malignant moaning right it's not an

2051
01:26:24,520 --> 01:26:29,280
attempt to diagnose or solve any problem

2052
01:26:27,400 --> 01:26:32,119
it's just a contagious expression of

2053
01:26:29,280 --> 01:26:35,119
misery a moan of pain that masquerades

2054
01:26:32,119 --> 01:26:37,880
as a political agenda sexual Marxism

2055
01:26:35,119 --> 01:26:42,040
they call it the redistribution of sex

2056
01:26:37,880 --> 01:26:43,679
State mandated GFS that's very valid of

2057
01:26:42,040 --> 01:26:46,600
course they don't actually expect any of

2058
01:26:43,679 --> 01:26:48,760
this to happen that's not the point so

2059
01:26:46,600 --> 01:26:51,480
incels are kind of a universal punching

2060
01:26:48,760 --> 01:26:53,480
bag online it's very easy to point and

2061
01:26:51,480 --> 01:26:54,800
laugh at them but what's harder is to

2062
01:26:53,480 --> 01:26:56,480
look in the mirror

2063
01:26:54,800 --> 01:26:58,840
and notice how these exact same

2064
01:26:56,480 --> 01:27:01,000
Tendencies are rampant in our own

2065
01:26:58,840 --> 01:27:03,080
communities so the inso of black pill is

2066
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:05,719
just one instance of what I call an

2067
01:27:03,080 --> 01:27:07,639
ideology of resentment a discourse that

2068
01:27:05,719 --> 01:27:09,280
outwardly appears like moral or

2069
01:27:07,639 --> 01:27:11,960
political critique but which on

2070
01:27:09,280 --> 01:27:14,560
examination is mainly just a resentful

2071
01:27:11,960 --> 01:27:17,520
moan the goal of resentment politics is

2072
01:27:14,560 --> 01:27:20,239
not to improve conditions in fact the

2073
01:27:17,520 --> 01:27:23,520
resentful person is full of contempt for

2074
01:27:20,239 --> 01:27:25,960
any morally compromised sellouts who are

2075
01:27:23,520 --> 01:27:28,119
attempting to en act plausible reforms

2076
01:27:25,960 --> 01:27:30,960
they don't want Victory they don't want

2077
01:27:28,119 --> 01:27:33,639
Power they want to endlessly critique

2078
01:27:30,960 --> 01:27:36,560
power because for them critique is an

2079
01:27:33,639 --> 01:27:39,760
important psychological defense against

2080
01:27:36,560 --> 01:27:41,960
feeling impotent shayer described it

2081
01:27:39,760 --> 01:27:44,080
this way it is peculiar to ramont

2082
01:27:41,960 --> 01:27:46,159
criticism that it does not seriously

2083
01:27:44,080 --> 01:27:48,159
desire that its demands be fulfilled it

2084
01:27:46,159 --> 01:27:50,400
does not want to cure the evil the evil

2085
01:27:48,159 --> 01:27:52,080
is merely a pretext for the criticism

2086
01:27:50,400 --> 01:27:54,560
what am I going to do with my eyes I

2087
01:27:52,080 --> 01:27:57,080
think a pink kind of look even a lot of

2088
01:27:54,560 --> 01:27:59,920
pink looks I just I love that hay fever

2089
01:27:57,080 --> 01:28:02,320
look as a general rule the more radical

2090
01:27:59,920 --> 01:28:04,520
a political Community claims to be the

2091
01:28:02,320 --> 01:28:06,560
more likely it is to be a community of

2092
01:28:04,520 --> 01:28:09,400
resentment self- styled radicals will

2093
01:28:06,560 --> 01:28:11,679
tell you superficial surface reforms do

2094
01:28:09,400 --> 01:28:13,920
not interest us the problem must be

2095
01:28:11,679 --> 01:28:16,080
critiqued at its root and then the root

2096
01:28:13,920 --> 01:28:18,840
turns out to be this Universal

2097
01:28:16,080 --> 01:28:21,800
all-encompassing evil right Society

2098
01:28:18,840 --> 01:28:23,880
itself the system the machine a

2099
01:28:21,800 --> 01:28:25,920
resentment ideologue always imagines

2100
01:28:23,880 --> 01:28:29,239
himself self to be engaged in a kind of

2101
01:28:25,920 --> 01:28:31,880
satanic revolt against an omnipotent

2102
01:28:29,239 --> 01:28:33,560
omnipresent enemy okay I just need to do

2103
01:28:31,880 --> 01:28:34,840
makeup for a second it's harder than it

2104
01:28:33,560 --> 01:28:36,239
looks to be a makeup vlogger like it's

2105
01:28:34,840 --> 01:28:38,679
hard to talk while doing this and

2106
01:28:36,239 --> 01:28:40,800
nothing short of total Revolution counts

2107
01:28:38,679 --> 01:28:43,960
as any sort of Victory whatsoever we

2108
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:46,400
have to dismantle the entire system burn

2109
01:28:43,960 --> 01:28:48,400
it all down I guess it's pedestrian to

2110
01:28:46,400 --> 01:28:50,480
point out that this is the Revolutionary

2111
01:28:48,400 --> 01:28:52,520
utopian equivalent of Christians

2112
01:28:50,480 --> 01:28:55,080
awaiting the last judgment our kingdom

2113
01:28:52,520 --> 01:28:58,040
is coming comrades often the appeal of

2114
01:28:55,080 --> 01:29:01,280
utopian ideology is similar to religion

2115
01:28:58,040 --> 01:29:03,880
it's not about health care higher wages

2116
01:29:01,280 --> 01:29:06,280
relief from police violence those are

2117
01:29:03,880 --> 01:29:09,280
actual goals that could be demanded

2118
01:29:06,280 --> 01:29:12,080
worked for and achieved utopian ideology

2119
01:29:09,280 --> 01:29:13,360
instead promises relief from some

2120
01:29:12,080 --> 01:29:16,520
general

2121
01:29:13,360 --> 01:29:18,840
malaise alienation and so ironically it

2122
01:29:16,520 --> 01:29:21,360
can have the same opiate effect that

2123
01:29:18,840 --> 01:29:23,119
Marx ascribed to religion but released

2124
01:29:21,360 --> 01:29:25,840
from the general anguish of human

2125
01:29:23,119 --> 01:29:27,480
existence is not a political goal

2126
01:29:25,840 --> 01:29:30,600
there's been many Revolutions in the

2127
01:29:27,480 --> 01:29:34,480
last few centuries and so far zero

2128
01:29:30,600 --> 01:29:37,000
Utopias resentment envy and hunger for

2129
01:29:34,480 --> 01:29:39,159
that matter are not satiated by the

2130
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:41,840
downfall of the old regime when the

2131
01:29:39,159 --> 01:29:45,600
people have no bread they eat the

2132
01:29:41,840 --> 01:29:47,679
rich and when the rich are gone they eat

2133
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:50,400
each other and because of the proximity

2134
01:29:47,679 --> 01:29:52,600
effect Envy may actually increase after

2135
01:29:50,400 --> 01:29:55,320
the revolution you may actually be more

2136
01:29:52,600 --> 01:29:58,719
envious of a favored comrade a

2137
01:29:55,320 --> 01:30:01,000
successful siton we a kulok than you

2138
01:29:58,719 --> 01:30:04,159
ever were of the aristocrats so eny

2139
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:06,840
turns paranoid and imaginative in

2140
01:30:04,159 --> 01:30:10,000
Revolutionary moments it gets sublimated

2141
01:30:06,840 --> 01:30:12,560
into morality and the accusations start

2142
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:14,600
flying that citizen is conspiring

2143
01:30:12,560 --> 01:30:17,159
against the revolution that peasant is

2144
01:30:14,600 --> 01:30:19,600
hoarding grain so the guillotine starts

2145
01:30:17,159 --> 01:30:22,520
slicing thousands of heads off the ggs

2146
01:30:19,600 --> 01:30:24,800
fill up or an authoritarian strong man

2147
01:30:22,520 --> 01:30:27,119
takes over just to announce another

2148
01:30:24,800 --> 01:30:29,600
Revolution two decades later the things

2149
01:30:27,119 --> 01:30:32,400
people will do to stay relevant honestly

2150
01:30:29,600 --> 01:30:37,280
and for what what long-term egalitarian

2151
01:30:32,400 --> 01:30:37,280
Utopia results socialism with Chinese

2152
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:41,800
characteristics so look I do understand

2153
01:30:39,960 --> 01:30:44,119
that sometimes you just have to do a

2154
01:30:41,800 --> 01:30:46,400
revolution and if I'd been there in

2155
01:30:44,119 --> 01:30:48,000
1789 I'm sure I'd be storming the best

2156
01:30:46,400 --> 01:30:50,280
deal myself but I just wish we could

2157
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:51,960
stop being so dyed about it Revolution

2158
01:30:50,280 --> 01:30:54,040
is a bloody nightmare that happens

2159
01:30:51,960 --> 01:30:56,760
because Society is collapsing and people

2160
01:30:54,040 --> 01:30:58,320
are desperate at worst Revolution is

2161
01:30:56,760 --> 01:31:00,480
nothing more than a violent day of

2162
01:30:58,320 --> 01:31:02,560
Retribution and at best it lays the

2163
01:31:00,480 --> 01:31:04,199
groundwork for future incremental

2164
01:31:02,560 --> 01:31:06,520
progress but it will never Usher in

2165
01:31:04,199 --> 01:31:08,520
Utopia nor is it the antidote to a vague

2166
01:31:06,520 --> 01:31:11,040
sense of unease which I'm sorry to

2167
01:31:08,520 --> 01:31:14,320
report is simply the resting state of an

2168
01:31:11,040 --> 01:31:16,679
unsedated human mind now I'm not saying

2169
01:31:14,320 --> 01:31:19,159
as some conservatives do that all

2170
01:31:16,679 --> 01:31:22,520
leftist or all egalitarian politics is

2171
01:31:19,159 --> 01:31:25,080
born of Envy no this is a specific

2172
01:31:22,520 --> 01:31:27,440
subtype there are PL plenty of reasons

2173
01:31:25,080 --> 01:31:29,560
other than Envy or fear of Envy to

2174
01:31:27,440 --> 01:31:31,520
oppose an economic distribution where

2175
01:31:29,560 --> 01:31:32,920
some people have billions of dollars

2176
01:31:31,520 --> 01:31:35,400
while other people are dying because

2177
01:31:32,920 --> 01:31:36,880
they can't afford insulin objectively

2178
01:31:35,400 --> 01:31:39,040
that is not an efficient use of

2179
01:31:36,880 --> 01:31:41,159
resources to promote human well-being

2180
01:31:39,040 --> 01:31:43,199
and personally I just don't want to live

2181
01:31:41,159 --> 01:31:44,800
in a country where people are dying

2182
01:31:43,199 --> 01:31:46,960
because they can't afford medicine and

2183
01:31:44,800 --> 01:31:49,400
I'm willing to pay however many taxes it

2184
01:31:46,960 --> 01:31:51,400
takes for that not to happen so while

2185
01:31:49,400 --> 01:31:54,760
I'm putting down straw man versions of

2186
01:31:51,400 --> 01:31:57,520
my argument I'm also not saying oh let's

2187
01:31:54,760 --> 01:32:00,159
just stop being envious no that's

2188
01:31:57,520 --> 01:32:02,280
impossible I think Envy is like libido

2189
01:32:00,159 --> 01:32:04,800
it's a basic force of human nature

2190
01:32:02,280 --> 01:32:07,080
that's more or less Unstoppable but with

2191
01:32:04,800 --> 01:32:10,080
the right leadership I think that Envy

2192
01:32:07,080 --> 01:32:11,760
can potentially be sublimated or

2193
01:32:10,080 --> 01:32:15,280
redirected into something more

2194
01:32:11,760 --> 01:32:17,920
constructive because raw Envy is a very

2195
01:32:15,280 --> 01:32:19,679
bad basis for egalitarian politics it

2196
01:32:17,920 --> 01:32:21,600
often targets the wrong people like

2197
01:32:19,679 --> 01:32:23,280
millionaires instead of billionaires and

2198
01:32:21,600 --> 01:32:25,159
eventually it turns the revolution

2199
01:32:23,280 --> 01:32:27,840
against itself and you get the circular

2200
01:32:25,159 --> 01:32:30,159
firing squad the self- cannibalism the

2201
01:32:27,840 --> 01:32:32,320
problem I see on the left today is that

2202
01:32:30,159 --> 01:32:35,159
without any genuine political Outlet

2203
01:32:32,320 --> 01:32:37,920
resentment mostly manifests as morality

2204
01:32:35,159 --> 01:32:40,080
morality itself being a way to vent

2205
01:32:37,920 --> 01:32:42,320
envious aggression and vindictiveness on

2206
01:32:40,080 --> 01:32:44,000
the left we claim to be so impersonal

2207
01:32:42,320 --> 01:32:47,440
right we're all about structural

2208
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:49,880
analysis the material conditions systems

2209
01:32:47,440 --> 01:32:51,560
of power intersectional identity

2210
01:32:49,880 --> 01:32:53,360
hierarchies but if you look at what

2211
01:32:51,560 --> 01:32:55,760
people actually spend their time doing

2212
01:32:53,360 --> 01:32:58,280
here it's all this obsessive moral

2213
01:32:55,760 --> 01:33:00,639
policing I wonder if because leftists

2214
01:32:58,280 --> 01:33:03,280
can't seem to win on any major political

2215
01:33:00,639 --> 01:33:06,280
stage we feel disempowered and so this

2216
01:33:03,280 --> 01:33:08,560
moral fanaticism is a psychological

2217
01:33:06,280 --> 01:33:11,280
substitute like with Marie Antoinette

2218
01:33:08,560 --> 01:33:14,600
it's easier to blame people than systems

2219
01:33:11,280 --> 01:33:16,639
also structural analysis is very boring

2220
01:33:14,600 --> 01:33:19,440
and destroying people with gossip is

2221
01:33:16,639 --> 01:33:22,719
extremely entertaining this obsessive

2222
01:33:19,440 --> 01:33:25,239
moral policing also gets turned Inward

2223
01:33:22,719 --> 01:33:28,080
and becomes leftist guilt you know this

2224
01:33:25,239 --> 01:33:30,000
useless internalized scolding I think

2225
01:33:28,080 --> 01:33:31,800
I'm done with my makeup what do we think

2226
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:33,440
leave a comment I'm always hesitant to

2227
01:33:31,800 --> 01:33:35,280
do anything about skin care since last

2228
01:33:33,440 --> 01:33:37,280
time I did skincare I was critiqued by

2229
01:33:35,280 --> 01:33:39,600
Hyrum so I am going to spray my face a

2230
01:33:37,280 --> 01:33:42,400
couple times with this this tatcha skin

2231
01:33:39,600 --> 01:33:44,199
Mist if that's okay with Hyrum it feels

2232
01:33:42,400 --> 01:33:45,320
good to finally address this Feud clear

2233
01:33:44,199 --> 01:33:47,920
the

2234
01:33:45,320 --> 01:33:48,960
air I look a lot better with makeup I

2235
01:33:47,920 --> 01:33:50,639
don't want to say that I don't have

2236
01:33:48,960 --> 01:33:52,960
natural beauty it's just that it's very

2237
01:33:50,639 --> 01:33:55,280
much enhanced by painting a a different

2238
01:33:52,960 --> 01:33:56,840
face on top of my face but hey at least

2239
01:33:55,280 --> 01:33:58,880
this way I've kind of like I've kind of

2240
01:33:56,840 --> 01:34:00,600
earned it you know because it's my skill

2241
01:33:58,880 --> 01:34:02,800
so there's a podcast called guilty

2242
01:34:00,600 --> 01:34:04,199
feminist that's been running for years

2243
01:34:02,800 --> 01:34:06,040
and I haven't listened in a while but in

2244
01:34:04,199 --> 01:34:08,280
the early episodes they'd bring on these

2245
01:34:06,040 --> 01:34:12,320
women who would confess their feminist

2246
01:34:08,280 --> 01:34:17,400
sins you know hi my name is Amber I'm a

2247
01:34:12,320 --> 01:34:19,320
feminist but I enjoy being choked in bed

2248
01:34:17,400 --> 01:34:21,760
it's hard being a woman not only are you

2249
01:34:19,320 --> 01:34:24,520
being choked you also feel guilty about

2250
01:34:21,760 --> 01:34:26,440
it the same moral hand ringing happens

2251
01:34:24,520 --> 01:34:29,440
with body positivity when you make

2252
01:34:26,440 --> 01:34:30,760
loving your body into a moral imperative

2253
01:34:29,440 --> 01:34:32,480
not only are you still going to hate

2254
01:34:30,760 --> 01:34:34,760
your body but now you're also going to

2255
01:34:32,480 --> 01:34:36,679
feel guilty about hating your body

2256
01:34:34,760 --> 01:34:38,480
because it makes you a bad feminist so

2257
01:34:36,679 --> 01:34:41,719
there was one problem and now there's

2258
01:34:38,480 --> 01:34:43,679
two problems thanks morality that's very

2259
01:34:41,719 --> 01:34:45,679
helpful now I want to take a moment to

2260
01:34:43,679 --> 01:34:48,040
acknowledge that a lot of conservatives

2261
01:34:45,679 --> 01:34:50,520
have made some version of the argument

2262
01:34:48,040 --> 01:34:53,080
I'm making in this video for example

2263
01:34:50,520 --> 01:34:55,719
Jordan Peterson and Camille Paia have

2264
01:34:53,080 --> 01:34:57,960
argued that academic postmodernists are

2265
01:34:55,719 --> 01:35:00,560
motivated by resentment the argument is

2266
01:34:57,960 --> 01:35:03,239
that deconstructionist literary theory

2267
01:35:00,560 --> 01:35:05,560
is a kind of envious Vengeance against

2268
01:35:03,239 --> 01:35:07,800
the beauty and virtuosity of canonical

2269
01:35:05,560 --> 01:35:09,719
great art and yeah there's probably some

2270
01:35:07,800 --> 01:35:11,920
truth to that a lot of academics are

2271
01:35:09,719 --> 01:35:14,320
failed artists but I was even more M

2272
01:35:11,920 --> 01:35:17,119
than that I've noticed that workingclass

2273
01:35:14,320 --> 01:35:19,520
non-academic socialists do tend to be

2274
01:35:17,119 --> 01:35:21,679
more productive and more self-advancing

2275
01:35:19,520 --> 01:35:24,080
involved in unionizing or organizing

2276
01:35:21,679 --> 01:35:27,040
whereas it's usually people who went to

2277
01:35:24,080 --> 01:35:29,360
college I went to

2278
01:35:27,040 --> 01:35:31,920
college presumably because they had

2279
01:35:29,360 --> 01:35:34,159
middle class Ambitions at some point but

2280
01:35:31,920 --> 01:35:36,320
whose middle class Ambitions have failed

2281
01:35:34,159 --> 01:35:37,840
who become the great critiquers of

2282
01:35:36,320 --> 01:35:39,679
capital I mean I can tell you from

2283
01:35:37,840 --> 01:35:41,600
experience that when I was eating Chef

2284
01:35:39,679 --> 01:35:43,280
Boyard over my Master's Degree that's

2285
01:35:41,600 --> 01:35:45,679
when I was most likely to say things

2286
01:35:43,280 --> 01:35:47,800
like according to Antonio GR in the

2287
01:35:45,679 --> 01:35:50,520
logic of L stage capitalism the

2288
01:35:47,800 --> 01:35:53,639
culturally demonic neoliberal ideology

2289
01:35:50,520 --> 01:35:56,119
manufactures the consent of the Cil uh

2290
01:35:53,639 --> 01:35:58,560
so point taken but some conservatives

2291
01:35:56,119 --> 01:36:00,719
take this argument way too far and try

2292
01:35:58,560 --> 01:36:02,679
to argue that the entire left is nothing

2293
01:36:00,719 --> 01:36:04,239
but a coalition of resentment like

2294
01:36:02,679 --> 01:36:06,400
there's a video on YouTube of the

2295
01:36:04,239 --> 01:36:08,400
philosophy Professor Steven Hicks doing

2296
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:10,480
a version of the postmodernism is

2297
01:36:08,400 --> 01:36:12,320
resentment argument and in the comments

2298
01:36:10,480 --> 01:36:15,480
section there's a bunch of people saying

2299
01:36:12,320 --> 01:36:18,560
this describes black lives matter antifa

2300
01:36:15,480 --> 01:36:20,360
and the Democrats does it though I mean

2301
01:36:18,560 --> 01:36:22,360
any political movement is going to have

2302
01:36:20,360 --> 01:36:25,080
people in it who suffer from resentment

2303
01:36:22,360 --> 01:36:27,159
poisoning but black lives matter at its

2304
01:36:25,080 --> 01:36:29,719
core is about the right not to be

2305
01:36:27,159 --> 01:36:32,360
murdered by police the slogan black

2306
01:36:29,719 --> 01:36:35,000
lives matter is an affirmation of the

2307
01:36:32,360 --> 01:36:37,280
value of black life so that seems like

2308
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:39,000
something even n would approve of Huey

2309
01:36:37,280 --> 01:36:41,600
Newton the co-founder of the Black

2310
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:43,600
Panther Party was inspired by n to

2311
01:36:41,600 --> 01:36:45,880
create the slogan all power to the

2312
01:36:43,600 --> 01:36:47,880
people when we coined the expression all

2313
01:36:45,880 --> 01:36:49,719
power to the people we had in mind

2314
01:36:47,880 --> 01:36:51,679
emphasizing the word power for we

2315
01:36:49,719 --> 01:36:54,080
recognize that the will to power is the

2316
01:36:51,679 --> 01:36:56,119
basic Drive of man but it is incorrect

2317
01:36:54,080 --> 01:36:58,560
to seek power over people we have been

2318
01:36:56,119 --> 01:37:00,800
subjugated to the dehumanizing power of

2319
01:36:58,560 --> 01:37:02,760
exploitation and racism for hundreds of

2320
01:37:00,800 --> 01:37:05,560
years and the black community has its

2321
01:37:02,760 --> 01:37:07,840
Will To Power also what we seek however

2322
01:37:05,560 --> 01:37:11,159
is not power over people but the power

2323
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:13,280
of control of our own destiny that to me

2324
01:37:11,159 --> 01:37:15,760
is a role model for how to do identity

2325
01:37:13,280 --> 01:37:18,000
politics without centering resentment

2326
01:37:15,760 --> 01:37:20,280
it's instead an affirmation of

2327
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:22,960
self-determination and self-respect like

2328
01:37:20,280 --> 01:37:24,320
n would say it's saying yes to yourself

2329
01:37:22,960 --> 01:37:26,400
whereas if you're your whole political

2330
01:37:24,320 --> 01:37:28,119
project is defined in the negative then

2331
01:37:26,400 --> 01:37:30,440
you're allowing yourself to be defined

2332
01:37:28,119 --> 01:37:32,360
by your enemies I find feminism is prone

2333
01:37:30,440 --> 01:37:34,719
to this where even and in fact

2334
01:37:32,360 --> 01:37:36,639
especially the most radical feminists

2335
01:37:34,719 --> 01:37:38,840
cannot seem to escape this resentful

2336
01:37:36,639 --> 01:37:41,400
consciousness of being The Second Sex

2337
01:37:38,840 --> 01:37:43,560
and defining themselves against men

2338
01:37:41,400 --> 01:37:45,560
earlier I mentioned Andrea dworin in a

2339
01:37:43,560 --> 01:37:48,000
positive way she's the most radical of

2340
01:37:45,560 --> 01:37:50,639
radical feminists and my first impulse

2341
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:52,719
is actually to defend her because she's

2342
01:37:50,639 --> 01:37:55,159
very widely hated and most of the people

2343
01:37:52,719 --> 01:37:57,560
who hate her hate a caricature like in

2344
01:37:55,159 --> 01:37:59,760
that Steven Hicks video Hicks summarizes

2345
01:37:57,560 --> 01:38:03,040
dworkin as calling all heterosexual

2346
01:37:59,760 --> 01:38:06,360
males rapists literally in the preface

2347
01:38:03,040 --> 01:38:09,119
to her most famous book Doran says if

2348
01:38:06,360 --> 01:38:11,159
one's sexual experience has always and

2349
01:38:09,119 --> 01:38:13,639
without exception been based on

2350
01:38:11,159 --> 01:38:16,199
dominance how could one understand that

2351
01:38:13,639 --> 01:38:19,000
this book does not say that all men are

2352
01:38:16,199 --> 01:38:20,920
rapists or that all intercourse is rap

2353
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:22,960
listen Hicks I get that you're a full

2354
01:38:20,920 --> 01:38:25,599
professor and I'm just a makeup vlogger

2355
01:38:22,960 --> 01:38:28,880
but my gu feeling on this one is before

2356
01:38:25,599 --> 01:38:30,760
criticizing a book maybe read the book

2357
01:38:28,880 --> 01:38:32,520
just a thought get it together Prof

2358
01:38:30,760 --> 01:38:34,360
you're being owned online by a makeup

2359
01:38:32,520 --> 01:38:35,960
vlogger I mean there's no shame in that

2360
01:38:34,360 --> 01:38:38,199
it happens to me all the time that being

2361
01:38:35,960 --> 01:38:41,080
said I do think that hicks is

2362
01:38:38,199 --> 01:38:43,639
coincidentally correct that dworin is a

2363
01:38:41,080 --> 01:38:46,280
theorist of resentment what dworin does

2364
01:38:43,639 --> 01:38:48,119
say in this book is arguably even more

2365
01:38:46,280 --> 01:38:50,320
Bleak than what is falsely attributed to

2366
01:38:48,119 --> 01:38:52,280
her the book is called intercourse she

2367
01:38:50,320 --> 01:38:53,560
wrote a book called intercourse imagine

2368
01:38:52,280 --> 01:38:54,920
writing a book called intercourse of

2369
01:38:53,560 --> 01:38:57,280
course I can actually easily imagine

2370
01:38:54,920 --> 01:39:00,280
that never mind so this is an argument

2371
01:38:57,280 --> 01:39:02,679
about the meaning of sex penetration to

2372
01:39:00,280 --> 01:39:05,040
be specific dworin argues that

2373
01:39:02,679 --> 01:39:08,280
penetration expresses domination

2374
01:39:05,040 --> 01:39:11,080
Invasion occupation possession contempt

2375
01:39:08,280 --> 01:39:13,880
degradation so it's against the Freudian

2376
01:39:11,080 --> 01:39:15,920
male castration anxiety interpretation

2377
01:39:13,880 --> 01:39:18,280
where it's you know fear of being

2378
01:39:15,920 --> 01:39:20,360
devoured by the women imagine being

2379
01:39:18,280 --> 01:39:22,560
afraid of that imagine being afraid of

2380
01:39:20,360 --> 01:39:26,080
that I'm going to get a look of facelift

2381
01:39:22,560 --> 01:39:29,560
someday and I'm going to look like

2382
01:39:26,080 --> 01:39:31,960
this I'm perfect I certainly don't agree

2383
01:39:29,560 --> 01:39:33,599
with everything she says but isn't Doran

2384
01:39:31,960 --> 01:39:35,400
closer to the truth here closer than

2385
01:39:33,599 --> 01:39:37,920
Freud anyway you know think about what

2386
01:39:35,400 --> 01:39:41,920
men typically say to women during the

2387
01:39:37,920 --> 01:39:44,119
ACT do they say help I'm being devoured

2388
01:39:41,920 --> 01:39:46,520
never heard that one have you no usually

2389
01:39:44,119 --> 01:39:49,480
it's more along the lines of uh you like

2390
01:39:46,520 --> 01:39:51,119
that don't you you little Etc and of

2391
01:39:49,480 --> 01:39:53,880
course you can eroticize being

2392
01:39:51,119 --> 01:39:55,360
subjugated and degraded and enjoy it and

2393
01:39:53,880 --> 01:39:57,560
I think dorin would argue that most

2394
01:39:55,360 --> 01:40:00,520
women do eroticize subjugation because

2395
01:39:57,560 --> 01:40:03,000
they're taught to but enjoying it she'd

2396
01:40:00,520 --> 01:40:04,800
have to say doesn't change the meaning

2397
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:06,480
of what's happening so I think Doran

2398
01:40:04,800 --> 01:40:07,560
says some things that are very true and

2399
01:40:06,480 --> 01:40:09,520
some things that are off the [ __ ]

2400
01:40:07,560 --> 01:40:12,199
rails where she loses me is where she

2401
01:40:09,520 --> 01:40:14,199
starts getting blackpilled and this book

2402
01:40:12,199 --> 01:40:17,360
this is the feminist black pill it is

2403
01:40:14,199 --> 01:40:20,400
250 pages of of hopeless misery and rage

2404
01:40:17,360 --> 01:40:23,040
she says male dominant gender hierarchy

2405
01:40:20,400 --> 01:40:25,040
seems immune to reform this may be

2406
01:40:23,040 --> 01:40:28,199
because because intercourse itself is

2407
01:40:25,040 --> 01:40:30,800
immune to reform uh okay so women will

2408
01:40:28,199 --> 01:40:34,639
never be free until men stop putting the

2409
01:40:30,800 --> 01:40:37,159
p in the v We Can Dream Andrea we can

2410
01:40:34,639 --> 01:40:39,520
dream like most ideology of resentment

2411
01:40:37,159 --> 01:40:41,880
this book is totally dismissive of any

2412
01:40:39,520 --> 01:40:43,960
plausible reforms that might actually

2413
01:40:41,880 --> 01:40:46,080
improve the situation of women instead

2414
01:40:43,960 --> 01:40:48,840
preferring to wallow in the endless

2415
01:40:46,080 --> 01:40:50,639
violence filth and objection of it all I

2416
01:40:48,840 --> 01:40:52,800
also think it's symptomatic that dworin

2417
01:40:50,639 --> 01:40:55,520
identifies as a lesbian but in that

2418
01:40:52,800 --> 01:40:58,119
second wave political way quoting from

2419
01:40:55,520 --> 01:41:00,560
the forward to dworin it was a badge of

2420
01:40:58,119 --> 01:41:02,320
rebellion against the patriarchy in 30

2421
01:41:00,560 --> 01:41:04,280
plus years of knowing her I've never

2422
01:41:02,320 --> 01:41:06,320
heard of a single romance with a woman

2423
01:41:04,280 --> 01:41:08,960
not one this is not surprising to me

2424
01:41:06,320 --> 01:41:12,480
from the author of a 250 page book about

2425
01:41:08,960 --> 01:41:14,320
sex that not once pauses to even imagine

2426
01:41:12,480 --> 01:41:16,080
the possibility of intimacy Between

2427
01:41:14,320 --> 01:41:18,199
Women because it's not a lesbianism

2428
01:41:16,080 --> 01:41:21,119
that's about saying yes to women it's a

2429
01:41:18,199 --> 01:41:22,679
lesbianism that's about saying no to men

2430
01:41:21,119 --> 01:41:24,360
you know people think that lesbians are

2431
01:41:22,679 --> 01:41:27,080
the biggest m man haters but I don't

2432
01:41:24,360 --> 01:41:29,199
think that's true I think lesbians just

2433
01:41:27,080 --> 01:41:32,639
don't think about men that much the only

2434
01:41:29,199 --> 01:41:34,679
men I think about are are Fred n and uh

2435
01:41:32,639 --> 01:41:36,480
edus the king it's straight women who

2436
01:41:34,679 --> 01:41:38,599
are usually the real manh haters cuz

2437
01:41:36,480 --> 01:41:40,880
they're stuck with this and love is

2438
01:41:38,599 --> 01:41:42,960
closer to hatred than neutrality so what

2439
01:41:40,880 --> 01:41:45,119
does Andrea dworin actually want what

2440
01:41:42,960 --> 01:41:46,560
would she say yes to if she said yes to

2441
01:41:45,119 --> 01:41:48,080
anything Sometimes women have trouble

2442
01:41:46,560 --> 01:41:51,400
saying what they want cuz no one ever

2443
01:41:48,080 --> 01:41:53,239
told them they could romance that's what

2444
01:41:51,400 --> 01:41:55,360
Jon didan said is the real desire of the

2445
01:41:53,239 --> 01:41:57,360
women's movement Jon didan of course

2446
01:41:55,360 --> 01:41:59,840
being not like other girls dwen offers

2447
01:41:57,360 --> 01:42:01,880
occasional glimpses of a positive desire

2448
01:41:59,840 --> 01:42:03,920
despite all efforts to socialize women

2449
01:42:01,880 --> 01:42:06,199
to one intercourse women still want a

2450
01:42:03,920 --> 01:42:08,280
more diffuse and tender sensuality that

2451
01:42:06,199 --> 01:42:11,239
evolves the whole body in a polymorphous

2452
01:42:08,280 --> 01:42:13,719
tenderness that does sound nice I'm so

2453
01:42:11,239 --> 01:42:15,639
lonely I think it's a bit bold to speak

2454
01:42:13,719 --> 01:42:17,920
for all women though like there are

2455
01:42:15,639 --> 01:42:20,760
definitely women out there who uh they

2456
01:42:17,920 --> 01:42:24,280
don't make love Anastasia

2457
01:42:20,760 --> 01:42:26,679
they hard I'm really sleepy and this bed

2458
01:42:24,280 --> 01:42:28,719
right behind me it just looks so nice

2459
01:42:26,679 --> 01:42:31,280
get in here right now whatever I just go

2460
01:42:28,719 --> 01:42:32,800
to sleep and then wake up and then just

2461
01:42:31,280 --> 01:42:34,320
record the rest of the video when I wake

2462
01:42:32,800 --> 01:42:36,239
up I don't want to do it now I'll get

2463
01:42:34,320 --> 01:42:37,639
Pikachu that'll make this easier isn't

2464
01:42:36,239 --> 01:42:40,199
it better for me to have a friend

2465
01:42:37,639 --> 01:42:42,480
Pikachu is the most adorable Pokemon why

2466
01:42:40,199 --> 01:42:44,159
cuz he's the yellowest name one thing

2467
01:42:42,480 --> 01:42:45,840
more yellow than Pikachu you can't name

2468
01:42:44,159 --> 01:42:48,320
any you can't think of anything so if

2469
01:42:45,840 --> 01:42:50,840
diffuse and tender sensuality is what

2470
01:42:48,320 --> 01:42:51,840
you want then just say that is that what

2471
01:42:50,840 --> 01:42:55,000
you want

2472
01:42:51,840 --> 01:42:57,960
Pikachu better it is and dorin did get

2473
01:42:55,000 --> 01:43:01,880
married to a gay man so I guess she

2474
01:42:57,960 --> 01:43:01,880
found what she wanted

2475
01:43:02,159 --> 01:43:06,679
lucky envying Andrea dorin is that

2476
01:43:05,040 --> 01:43:09,239
really what we've sunk to around here

2477
01:43:06,679 --> 01:43:11,320
you know I've been noticing the poison

2478
01:43:09,239 --> 01:43:14,360
creeping into my mind lately I know this

2479
01:43:11,320 --> 01:43:15,920
isn't very original but I had a bad year

2480
01:43:14,360 --> 01:43:18,719
you know I fell in love with my best

2481
01:43:15,920 --> 01:43:21,520
friend like a gay idiot got my heart

2482
01:43:18,719 --> 01:43:24,360
comprehensively broken and then Co hit

2483
01:43:21,520 --> 01:43:26,840
and gave me a year of solid itude to

2484
01:43:24,360 --> 01:43:29,000
spiral deeper into a hell of my own

2485
01:43:26,840 --> 01:43:31,599
making you know I stopped saying yes to

2486
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:34,440
life and I started saying yes to chasing

2487
01:43:31,599 --> 01:43:36,320
the dragon by which I mean playing Spyro

2488
01:43:34,440 --> 01:43:38,800
the Dragon one of the greatest

2489
01:43:36,320 --> 01:43:42,320
appropriate for all ages video games of

2490
01:43:38,800 --> 01:43:44,239
all time look at him go I'm taking the

2491
01:43:42,320 --> 01:43:46,520
hair clips out I catch myself having

2492
01:43:44,239 --> 01:43:49,520
bitter spinster thoughts it's because

2493
01:43:46,520 --> 01:43:51,639
I'm trans it's because I'm gay that's

2494
01:43:49,520 --> 01:43:53,480
why I'll die alone you that's the reason

2495
01:43:51,639 --> 01:43:56,400
I'm alone definitely not because I don't

2496
01:43:53,480 --> 01:43:59,199
leave the house see I am not immune to

2497
01:43:56,400 --> 01:44:01,599
incel tier brain poisoning and you

2498
01:43:59,199 --> 01:44:05,520
really can use political theorizing as

2499
01:44:01,599 --> 01:44:08,599
an excuse not to fix your life Society

2500
01:44:05,520 --> 01:44:13,000
did this to me a transphobic Society

2501
01:44:08,599 --> 01:44:15,840
made me hate myself well yeah that's

2502
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:18,280
true but at a certain point you have to

2503
01:44:15,840 --> 01:44:20,400
take responsibility for your own mind

2504
01:44:18,280 --> 01:44:22,239
and decide to stop being an accomplice

2505
01:44:20,400 --> 01:44:24,440
in your own Annihilation since we keep

2506
01:44:22,239 --> 01:44:26,440
referencing Paradise is lost the mind is

2507
01:44:24,440 --> 01:44:28,599
its own place and in itself can make a

2508
01:44:26,440 --> 01:44:31,159
heaven of Hell a hell of Heaven yes

2509
01:44:28,599 --> 01:44:34,119
Squad so I asked myself what kind of

2510
01:44:31,159 --> 01:44:36,480
mind do I want to be do I want to obsess

2511
01:44:34,119 --> 01:44:38,520
over what I lack concede society's

2512
01:44:36,480 --> 01:44:40,920
Judgment of my inferiority become a

2513
01:44:38,520 --> 01:44:43,840
self-hating self-pitying envious

2514
01:44:40,920 --> 01:44:47,199
resentful little nothing or do I want to

2515
01:44:43,840 --> 01:44:50,080
get off the godamn floor stop chasing

2516
01:44:47,199 --> 01:44:52,639
the dragon and say yes to life the

2517
01:44:50,080 --> 01:44:54,159
answer of course is that I long to

2518
01:44:52,639 --> 01:44:56,080
return to the the sweet womb of my dark

2519
01:44:54,159 --> 01:44:57,679
mother but we're not going to do that

2520
01:44:56,080 --> 01:44:59,880
because there's plenty of time to numb

2521
01:44:57,679 --> 01:45:02,040
the pain after you die the sweet Embrace

2522
01:44:59,880 --> 01:45:05,480
of death is the darkest mother of all

2523
01:45:02,040 --> 01:45:09,080
also nothing is less attractive than an

2524
01:45:05,480 --> 01:45:11,880
envious resentful self-pitying person

2525
01:45:09,080 --> 01:45:14,480
it's beyond a personality flaw it's a

2526
01:45:11,880 --> 01:45:17,040
personality deformity that can ruin

2527
01:45:14,480 --> 01:45:19,239
whatever chance at happiness you have so

2528
01:45:17,040 --> 01:45:21,920

make sense heterosexuality let's put

2544
01:46:14,800 --> 01:46:19,280
that under the microscope H you want me

2545
01:46:16,880 --> 01:46:21,199
to believe that a straight woman who

2546
01:46:19,280 --> 01:46:23,800
knows the difference between magenta and

2547
01:46:21,199 --> 01:46:25,840
move is going to date a straight man who

2548
01:46:23,800 --> 01:46:27,679
thinks it's gay to wash his underwear

2549
01:46:25,840 --> 01:46:29,400
and that's just going to work out fine

2550
01:46:27,679 --> 01:46:30,080

2554
01:46:34,639 --> 01:46:38,360
date each other they can sit on the

2555
01:46:36,159 --> 01:46:40,320
couch all day playing Xbox and then each

2556
01:46:38,360 --> 01:46:42,960
other and then straight women can pair

2557
01:46:40,320 --> 01:46:45,239
off decoupage some [ __ ] and eat each

2558
01:46:42,960 --> 01:46:46,960
