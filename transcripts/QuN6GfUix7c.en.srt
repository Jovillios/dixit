00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:33,719
foreign invaders disguised as immigrants

8
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:37,079
and refugees are being imported to our

9
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:39,899
lands by a cabal of globalist elites and

10
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:42,660
if we don't stop it soon the result will

11
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:45,180

00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:51,110
imagine the faces of your wives and

14
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:55,079
children picture their pure white

15
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:57,809

17
00:00:57,809 --> 00:01:03,359

18
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:07,020
of the third world poured does that

19
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:10,080
thought fill you with rage good we must

20
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:13,439

22
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:19,500
history and for our culture to fight for

23
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:22,030
the homeland we've always known and the

24
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:27,840

[Applause]

28
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:55,549
so actually according to Hegel the for

29
00:01:53,539 --> 00:01:58,700
itself can only be actualized through

30
00:01:55,549 --> 00:02:01,700
the M itself so the individuation of the

31
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:04,100
subject necessarily demands the

32
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:06,380
transcendence of the dialectical object

33
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:08,989
through the sublimation of negative

34
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:12,410
materiality

35
00:02:08,989 --> 00:02:13,370
 you you racists death the

36
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:15,740
capitalized Oh

[Music]

42
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:44,810
so that speech didn't go too well huh

43
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:47,000
well what do you expect we have the

44
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:49,190
politicians against us a media run by

45
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,140
giant corporations and a complacent

46
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:53,210
white middle class that prefers order to

47
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:55,700
justice opposition to leftism

48
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:58,010
is hardly surprising so let's accept at

49
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:59,960
all that's true the game is rigged fine

50
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:02,360
now how do you respond to that situation

51
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:03,770
do you change nothing about your

52
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:05,810
strategy at all and then blame the

53
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:07,310
system when the predictable happens or

54
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:10,070
do you try to improve your rhetoric

55
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:12,110
somehow look I don't really need optics

56
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:14,150
advice from a boutique we're s beat who

57
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:15,800
put style over substance and thinks that

58
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:17,440
shining a pink light and everything can

59
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:20,330

why I can't be a communist Justine you

65
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:39,050
do realize that Marxism distinguishes

66
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:40,850
between private property and personal

67
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:41,600
property right you're allowed to own

68
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:43,370
possessions

69
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:45,500
you just can't exploit people by owning

70
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:47,630
the means of production well most of my

71
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:49,220
stuff was made by Chinese slaves well

72
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:50,840

politics great let's start by taking a

90
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:34,570
look at these patches and pins positives

91

just wearing it ironically no don't you

95
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:45,949

00:04:43,789 --> 00:04:48,380
lines and gulags and it needs to go well

97
00:04:45,949 --> 00:04:50,690

00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:53,720

too now hold on getting rid of the

102
00:04:56,660 --> 00:05:00,620
hammer and sickle is one thing but marks

103
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:01,970
as a foundational thinker in the history

104
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:03,830
of progressive I'm not talking about

105
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:06,080

108
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:12,440

117
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,720

119
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:41,490
the palm trees

120
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:45,190
[Music]

121
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:45,940
how about this lots of brands more more

actually hate you

127
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:01,030
hello fellow whites do you have a moment

128
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:02,440
to talk about the need to secure a

129
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:03,610
homeland for our people in the future

130
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:07,680
for white children the hell out of your

131
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:07,680
voice smash your face you Nazi

132
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:14,290
effective isn't it well I see your point

133
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:16,630
but this whole antiva thing I can't help

134
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:21,330
but wonder from a strict PR perspective

135
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:23,890
if there's some way you can to do that

136
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:26,380
are you saying we shouldn't punch Nazis

137
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:29,960
I'm saying if 30,000 people show up to

138
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:35,360
counter protest Nazis you won't have to

139
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:35,360
[Music]

140
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,940
but that means getting 30,000 people on

141
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,410
your side what you're not gonna do by

142
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:43,060
tweeting death threats and communist

143
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:45,220
propaganda and using words like

144
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:46,960
dialectic and telling everyone to read

145
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:48,490
obscure European philosophers with

146
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:51,190
unpronounceable names and unintelligible

147
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:52,870
ideas and smashing windows for no reason

148
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:54,700
that anyone can understand or sympathize

149
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:56,470
with and expecting that people are gonna

150
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:58,330
want to leave their jobs and comfortable

151
00:06:56,470 --> 00:07:00,280
lives to join a violent revolution to

152
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:01,930
establish an economic system primarily

153
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:03,760
associated with starvation and

154
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:06,520
dictatorship well that's an unfair

155
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:08,440
Association real communism doesn't lead

156
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:09,940
to starvation and dictatorship has there

157
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:13,450
ever been real communism

158
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:15,550
well yes between 1910 and 1912 and

159
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:17,890
revolutionary Eastern Cameroon a

160
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:20,290
thriving though short-lived communist

161
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:22,990
utopia did flourish until it was smashed

162
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:24,580
by Western imperialism right but what's

163
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:26,350
the chance of that actually happening on

164
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:27,910
a large scale in the near future you

165
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:29,530
seem to not even care about what's

166
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:31,360
actually possible that's how deep you

167
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:33,640
are and pure theory and if anything is

168
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,350
anti-marxist it's that you know

169
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:37,360
sometimes I think you secretly don't

170
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:39,010
want your ideas to succeed you actually

171
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,500
enjoy being a pariah whose political

172
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:43,240
ideas never gain any traction because if

173
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,720
you have purely theoretical political

174
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,160
beliefs

175
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:46,870
you're never accountable for the way

176
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:48,340
things are going I'm not saying theory

177
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:50,200
is everything only that there's no

178
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:52,120
practice without theory look I'm not

179
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:54,040
some kind of political scientist for all

180
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:56,020
I know you could be correct I'm just

181
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:57,580
saying it's a tough sell and you are not

182
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:59,320
selling it well I wouldn't have to work

183
00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:01,450
so hard to sell it if we didn't live in

184
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:03,340
a neoliberal intellectual void we're

185
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:05,260
complacent so called centrists with

186
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:07,330
corporate backing have shifted the

187
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:09,160
Overton Window one inch left of fascism

188
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:13,210
under the heading of free speech and

189
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:14,380
classical liberalism if someone ready to

190
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:16,999
bring their wares to the free

191
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:20,689
marketplace of ideas

192
00:08:16,999 --> 00:08:22,489

207
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:59,029
of a rusty Harrington like the

208
00:08:57,139 --> 00:09:00,980
anti-imperialist revolutionaries in

209
00:08:59,029 --> 00:09:02,629
Eastern Cameroon I mean nothing is ever

210
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:04,819
good enough for you people I'm gonna be

211
00:09:02,629 --> 00:09:06,920
munching on a cigar the South American

212
00:09:04,819 --> 00:09:08,779
jungle shooting at capitalists with a

213
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:10,069
black beret and an eyepatch and I still

214
00:09:08,779 --> 00:09:11,959
wouldn't be left-wing enough for you

215
00:09:10,069 --> 00:09:13,730
well why don't you start by not going to

216
00:09:11,959 --> 00:09:15,709
afternoon tea with people who protect

217
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:17,300
fascists and not complaining about the

218
00:09:15,709 --> 00:09:19,550
optics of people who are risking their

219
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:21,740
lives to keep you safe how is anti-fog

220
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:24,439
keeping me safe you do realize don't you

221
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:26,899
that 99% of what anti food does is not

222
00:09:24,439 --> 00:09:28,519
punching Nazis most of what we do is

223
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:31,160
behind the scenes organizing

224
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:33,439
infiltrating fascist groups daxing them

225
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:35,209
disrupting their recruitment and yes we

226
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:37,430
do engage in defensive violence of

227
00:09:35,209 --> 00:09:39,050
fascist rallies and one of these days if

228
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:40,970
you can bear to tear yourself away from

229
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:42,889
your teeth set long enough you're gonna

230
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:45,139
be on a counter protest and the black

231
00:09:42,889 --> 00:09:46,610
bloc is gonna save your life because you

232
00:09:45,139 --> 00:09:48,350
don't look like you can fight and the

233
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:51,889
police certainly aren't gonna save you

234
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:54,319
well maybe so I mean I'm the first to

235
00:09:51,889 --> 00:09:56,809
admit these are not Nazi punching hands

236
00:09:54,319 --> 00:09:58,939
so I'm not gonna get in your way but in

237
00:09:56,809 --> 00:10:00,680
a free marketplace of ideas and like it

238
00:09:58,939 --> 00:10:02,360
or not that's what we're pretty mark I

239
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:04,579
can't help but think that which you are

240
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:07,100
matters less than what you seem to be

241
00:10:04,579 --> 00:10:09,439
and black-clad thugs and masks smashing

242
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:11,809
things on the street seems pretty scary

243
00:10:09,439 --> 00:10:13,519
oh come on you have to admit there's

244
00:10:11,809 --> 00:10:16,220
something kind of appealing about a guy

245
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:21,520
in a mask what about a girl and a mask

246
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:23,620
[Music]

247
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:26,440
I think we should just be friends while

248
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:26,950
I figure myself out well it was worth a

249
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,810
shot

250
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:30,460
look my point is you can't just win the

251
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:32,560
war in the street you also have to win

252
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:35,170
the war in the heart and the mind I mean

253
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:37,300
the propaganda war Shh

254
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:39,520
don't call it propaganda there could be

255
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:41,410
liberals listening look what the left

256
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:43,330
needs to get and what the centrists need

257
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:45,550
to get and what only I and the fascists

258
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:48,370
seem to understand is that reason

259
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:49,750
doesn't matter very well by here we got

260
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:51,610
interests hate about social justice

261
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:52,990
warriors it's not that they don't have

262
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:55,150
good reasons and support of their

263
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:57,490
arguments is that they're not cool right

264
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:59,500
social justice warriors are not cool

265
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:01,600
what do you mean they're not popular no

266
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:03,760
no no I mean they're not cool you can be

267
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,860
unpopular and still cool and in fact you

268
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:08,440
can be cool to be unpopular so what does

269
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:10,540
it mean to be cool cool is calm detached

270
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:12,190
and in control of yourself and the

271
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:14,350
leading complaint about social justice

272
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:15,850
warriors is that they're emotional the

273
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:17,800
social justice warriors who everyone

274
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:19,750
cringes that online are people who I'm

275
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:21,730
sure are nice people but we're having a

276
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:23,500
bad moment and they're caught on camera

277
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:25,600
in the middle of an outburst they're out

278
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:28,570
of control and that's the problem it's

279
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:30,340
not cool look this detached ironic

280
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:32,230
pretend not to give a posturing

281
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:34,450
that white men mistake for rationality

282
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:36,070
is really just the self celebration of

283
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:37,990
comfortable privileged people with

284
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:40,180
nothing at stake people on the left are

285
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:42,010
never gonna be cool because anger and

286
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:44,110
emotion are irrational responses to

287
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:45,760
injustice I thought you'd say that but

288
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:47,980
what you're failing to consider is that

289
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:49,900
it's possible to be both angry and cool

290
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:52,870
and what do you get when you sprinkle a

291
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:55,740
little anger into a glass of cool what

292
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:55,740
you get

00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:09,110
and that's what we on the Left need to

296
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:09,650
become what the hell are you talking

297
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:13,460
about

298
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:15,680
Miles Davis incredibly cool but pretty

299
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:18,410
angry did not take from way people

300
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:20,030
but also ice cold so your

301
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:21,350
plan is to win over centrists by

302
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:24,020
becoming an ice cold

303
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:26,390
precisely what we need is social justice

304
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:27,140
drugs and rock and roll this is

305
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:28,940
ridiculous

306
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:33,560
and I suppose you think this is

307
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:34,280
ridiculous I think it's stalemate no
