1
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:06,930
on the day that the Female Eunuch was

2
00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:09,330
issued in America a person in flapping

3
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:12,630
draperies rushed up to me and grabbed my

4
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:14,490
hand thank you it breathed hoarsely

5
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:18,180
thank you so much for all you've done

6
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:21,119
for us girls I smoked and nodded and

7
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:24,750
stepped backward trying to extricate my

8
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:27,510
hand from the enormous knock Harry bring

9
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:29,730
and pour that clutched it the face

10
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:31,500
staring into mine was thickly coated

11
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:35,820
with a pancake and make up through which

12
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:37,950
the stubble was already in futile

13
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:41,340
competition with a Dynel wig of immense

14
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:43,860
Longhorns and two pairs of false

15
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:45,690
eyelashes against the bony ribs that

16
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:49,079
could be counted through it's flimsy

17
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:52,140
scarf dress while a polished steel

18
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:55,469
woman's iteration and more I should have

19
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:59,420
said you're a man the Female Eunuch has

20
00:00:55,469 --> 00:00:59,420
done less than nothing for you

21
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:09,710
[Music]

22
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:15,450
let's go adult human females

23
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:15,450
[Music]

24
00:01:16,689 --> 00:01:22,009
first of all a reminder that this video

25
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:25,909
is a female only space so if there are

26
00:01:22,009 --> 00:01:27,740
any men here today I mean unless you

27
00:01:25,909 --> 00:01:29,030
enjoy watching the very interesting

28
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:32,180
things women do on our own

29
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:34,460
in which case like comment subscribe but

30
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:36,470
so look it's 2019 and I think most

31
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:38,600
people have heard about turfs trans

32
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:40,250
exclusionary radical feminists you know

33
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:42,229
these fanatics like Germaine Greer who

34
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:46,940
called trans women it and think trans

35
00:01:42,229 --> 00:01:48,920
men are lost lesbian sisters you Meza do

36
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:50,060
know about trans men right male to

37
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:52,340
female is not the only type of

38
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:54,409
transgender person there's also people

39
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:59,000
who were born well people who were

40
00:01:54,409 --> 00:02:02,090
assigned people who are always people

41
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,470
who identify turfs don't like being

42
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:05,840
called turfs they think it's a term of

43
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:07,429
disparagement which it is they call

44
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,100
themselves radical feminists rad

45
00:02:07,429 --> 00:02:12,019
families or lately gender critical the

46
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:14,120
idea is that gender femininity

47
00:02:12,019 --> 00:02:15,860
masculinity gender roles all that it's

48
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:17,660
all a patriarchal construct and

49
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:19,310
biological sex is the only thing that

50
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:20,720
makes a person a man or a woman in the

51
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:23,000
past on this channel i've always--

52
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:25,100
caricatured terms as being like angry

53
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,720
man hating bigots whose only real tactic

54
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:28,459
is accusing trans women of being creepy

55
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,170
man and there definitely are some people

56
00:02:28,459 --> 00:02:32,510
who are really like that but i want to

57
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:34,400
be fair i want to be belongs so in

58
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:36,290
preparation to make this video i posted

59
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,090
an invitation to twitter asking people

60
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:39,769
who used to be gender critical feminists

61
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:41,660
to share their stories with me and i got

62
00:02:39,769 --> 00:02:43,459
hundreds of responses a lot of them from

63
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:45,440
women who've had traumatic experiences

64
00:02:43,459 --> 00:02:47,630
with men and who at one time found

65
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:49,250
comfort in a rigid view of gender where

66
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:51,320
women and men are completely separate

67
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:52,820
species where women are saved and men

68
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:54,530
are dangerous and for a lot of those

69
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:56,840
women allowing trans people into their

70
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:58,940
picture of the world at first challenged

71
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:00,799
their sense of stability and comfort

72
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:02,660
it was difficult emotional work work

73
00:03:00,799 --> 00:03:04,160
they needed to do but still difficult

74
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:06,140
and that makes total sense to me like

75
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:07,340
it's very easy for me to understand why

76
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:09,350
someone would feel that way

77
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:10,850
so it's not just evil bigots who are

78
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:12,620
attractive to the gender critical

79
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:14,630
worldview and in this video i don't just

80
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:16,549
want to parity turfs this time I want to

81
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:18,739
really engage with gender critical ideas

82
00:03:16,549 --> 00:03:20,030
in the public arena free speech open

83
00:03:18,739 --> 00:03:21,920
communication dialogue conversation

84
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:23,780
debate idea marketplace expression

85
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,129
discourse maybe I'll even get in touch

86
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:27,680
with my inner rod

87
00:03:25,129 --> 00:03:29,689
she's a little shy sure but she's here

88
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,730
not clear reads a lot of Germaine Greer

89
00:03:29,689 --> 00:03:34,310
and when I am having a dark night of the

90
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:36,290
soul sweaty she's feeling ex extra

91
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:42,739
biological' and when the full moon

92
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:44,659
shines she speaks oh this is agony I'm a

93
00:03:42,739 --> 00:03:47,019
biological woman trapped in the body of

94
00:03:44,659 --> 00:03:50,030
a male narcissist

95
00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:51,709
okay so she's a little out of touch sure

96
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:53,900
but she's not a bigot you know I'm sure

97
00:03:51,709 --> 00:03:57,049
she doesn't hate trans people she just

98
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:58,579
has a few concerns you know it's like

99
00:03:57,049 --> 00:04:00,590
you're not even allowed to ask questions

100
00:03:58,579 --> 00:04:02,719
anymore or you're accused of transphobia

101
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:04,760
we're all just expected to conform to

102
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:07,400
this gender ideology that we the public

103
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:09,829
never got a chance to debate we didn't

104
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:12,109
vote for trans orthodoxy yet here we are

105
00:04:09,829 --> 00:04:14,569
allowing biological males to run rampant

106
00:04:12,109 --> 00:04:16,549
in women's spaces wasting penises on

107
00:04:14,569 --> 00:04:18,829
lesbians and indoctrinating our children

108
00:04:16,549 --> 00:04:20,780
with the ludicrous dogma that girls can

109
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:24,139
become boys with a change of costume oh

110
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:25,669
it waddles my chromosomes she goes on

111
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:27,020
like that for hours it's like being

112
00:04:25,669 --> 00:04:29,030
trapped at the bottom of an elevator

113
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:30,680
shaft with a ghost of Anita Bryant do

114
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:32,900
you kids even know who Anita Bryant is

115
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:34,430
do you have any idea how many decades I

116
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:36,289
fought for your rights who doesn't need

117
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:37,940
a brain even dead scholars remain

118
00:04:36,289 --> 00:04:39,169
divided it does seem like it's getting

119
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:40,970
harder to have conversations about

120
00:04:39,169 --> 00:04:42,349
difficult topics you know our children

121
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:43,509
are coming of age and this Orwellian

122
00:04:42,349 --> 00:04:45,830
nightmare where you can face

123
00:04:43,509 --> 00:04:47,419
consequences for simply having a

124
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:50,180
politically incorrect opinion about the

125
00:04:47,419 --> 00:04:52,699
Jewish Question it's PC run amok it's a

126
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:54,139
Hanukkah Tosh trophy problematic banter

127
00:04:52,699 --> 00:04:56,270
aside the current discourse about

128
00:04:54,139 --> 00:04:57,830
transgender issues is an explosion of

129
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:59,479
untreated sewage we have far-right

130
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:00,620
politicians menacing us with legal

131
00:04:59,479 --> 00:05:02,270
discrimination and erasure

132
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:04,130
we have fear-mongering and hostility in

133
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:05,389
the press and that combined with high

134
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:07,310
rates of family rejection and

135
00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:09,320
mistreatment puts trans people on the

136
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:11,120
defensive so in public we tend to stick

137
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:13,070
together concede nothing and shield

138
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,830
ourselves behind simple unambiguous

139
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:18,620
slogans trans women are women which is

140
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:20,210
true we are women but ooh that was a

141
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:21,650
sinister plot watch out for that what

142
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:23,389
happens is that people who don't really

143
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:25,370
understand trans issues in other words

144
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:27,560
most people have lots of unanswered

145
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:29,330
questions about the details and in

146
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:31,610
particular people who are familiar with

147
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:33,710
feminist theory but not transfeminine

148
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:34,820
might wonder things like how can you be

149
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:36,229
a woman without the oppression

150
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,620
experiences of grah hood

151
00:05:36,229 --> 00:05:38,090
why can't

152
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:39,260
just be a feminine man instead of AK

153
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:43,310
waiting womanhood with sexist

154
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:45,770
stereotypes why our misogynistic gender

155
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:47,450
ideologues erasing the vocabulary needed

156
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:48,770
to discuss female oppression trans

157
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:50,300
people don't like engaging with these

158
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:51,860
questions because most of the time

159
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:53,360
they're just brandished as weapons

160
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:55,370
against us you know it's like when a man

161
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:58,130
asks if society is so sexist against

162
00:05:55,370 --> 00:06:00,680
women then why is it that men are 97% of

163
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:02,390
combat fatalities feminazis like you

164
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:04,280
could sit there for three hours trying

165
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:06,440
to make a nuanced feminist rebuttal but

166
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:08,600
wouldn't you rather just eat a bowl of

167
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:10,160
thumbtacks because nine times out of ten

168
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:12,680
that guy doesn't give a [ __ ] about

169
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,180
combat fatalities he's just trolling you

170
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:15,830
to shut down whatever actual point you

171
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:17,660
are making and the same goes for people

172
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:19,520
telling me you sure do like wearing

173
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:21,320
nails and makeup is that all you think

174
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:23,630
there is to being a woman could you

175
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:25,130
define womanhood for me like they don't

176
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:27,080
actually care they're just trying to

177
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:28,910
make my life worse for 20 minutes but if

178
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:30,740
you really are sincerely wondering about

179
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:32,630
the answer to these troll questions and

180
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:34,790
many people are then you actually need

181
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:36,470
fairly complicated and nuanced answers

182
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:38,210
which is why they make such good troll

183
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:40,160
questions because they waste a lot of

184
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:42,220
your time in this video I want to take

185
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,240
at face value the questions and concerns

186
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:46,520
associated with gender critical

187
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,440
hostility to trans people and I want to

188
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:50,540
try to give nuanced answers rather than

189
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:53,300
dogmatic ones now the problem with being

190
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:55,070
nuanced is that it's hard so I might

191
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:56,360
[ __ ] something up and a lot of trans

192
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:59,150
people want me to represent them

193
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:01,700
absolutely perfectly so if I do a [ __ ]

194
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:03,230
something up well just to read me to

195
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:05,900
filth on Twitter like you always do you

196
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:10,010
little shits love you let's watch an

197
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:11,990
instructional video to learn more can a

198
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:13,970
man ever be as glamorous as a woman we

199
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:16,220
have 13 beautiful women on our show

200
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:20,230
today only the catch is that some of

201
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:23,660
them are actually men oops wrong channel

202
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:25,850
concern one gender metaphysics there is

203
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:26,540
no such thing as a man trapped in a

204
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:28,640
woman's body

205
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:30,170
there are no pink brains and blue brains

206
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:32,000
just because you want to be a woman

207
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:34,190
doesn't mean you are one this whole

208
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,640
sacred dogma gender identity makes no

209
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:36,680
sense

210
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:38,270
trans people will often use metaphorical

211
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:39,980
language to describe feelings that are

212
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:41,540
difficult to put into words and that's

213
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:43,340
how I understand it the trapped in the

214
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:45,470
wrong body language is there literally

215
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:48,050
is such a thing as a male soul trapped

216
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:49,970
a female body or vice-versa I personally

217
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:52,220
don't believe there is but I'm a little

218
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:53,780
biased I sold my soul to a Sudanese

219
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:56,960
businessman and all I got in return was

220
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:59,210
this shitty ketamine habit

221
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:01,190
as for brains there is some evidence

222
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:03,259
suggesting a correlation between binary

223
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:04,850
trans gender identity and cross sex

224
00:08:03,259 --> 00:08:06,560
brain anatomy but the evidence really

225
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:08,479
doesn't justify claims about female

226
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,039
brains and male bodies or anything like

227
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:12,289
that brain differences between men and

228
00:08:10,039 --> 00:08:14,360
women are statistical averages of things

229
00:08:12,289 --> 00:08:16,310
like gray and white matter density not

230
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:18,830
as the term female brain implies

231
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:20,960
distinct anatomical structures like

232
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:22,910
penises and vaginas so I personally

233
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:25,100
don't believe in any gender metaphysics

234
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:26,900
at all I'm kind of an unorthodox trans

235
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:28,669
person so much for the unquestionable

236
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:30,470
dogma of the trans cult and that I think

237
00:08:28,669 --> 00:08:32,330
of myself as a woman who used to be a

238
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:33,950
man rather than as always having been a

239
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:35,779
woman but it's important to remember

240
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:39,229
that while I may not fit the typical

241
00:08:35,779 --> 00:08:41,089
profile I am NOT real and not valid but

242
00:08:39,229 --> 00:08:43,849
in any case I live as a woman now and

243
00:08:41,089 --> 00:08:46,580
that's kind of just what's happening

244
00:08:43,849 --> 00:08:48,649
whether you like it or not so I'm not

245
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:50,600
sorry my view is well expressed by

246
00:08:48,649 --> 00:08:52,730
Catherine McKenna I always thought I

247
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:54,620
don't care how someone becomes a woman

248
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:57,290
or a man doesn't matter to me

249
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:59,480
anybody who identifies as a woman wants

250
00:08:57,290 --> 00:09:02,860
to be a woman is going around being a

251
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:06,410
woman as far as I'm concerned as a woman

252
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:08,300
concern to gender stereotypes what do

253
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:09,560
you mean you live as a woman you mean

254
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:11,360
you reinforce oppressive gender

255
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:13,970
stereotypes by putting on nails makeup

256
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:16,550
and a fake girly vice listen sweaty

257
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:19,940
first of all my girly voice is very

258
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:22,850
[ __ ] real second my clothes make up

259
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:24,770
voice none of this makes me a woman no

260
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:26,839
trans woman thinks that femininity and

261
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:28,850
womanhood are the same rather we're

262
00:09:26,839 --> 00:09:31,339
using a cultural language of feminine

263
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:32,990
signifiers to prompt others to see us

264
00:09:31,339 --> 00:09:34,490
for what we are sometimes I get the

265
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:35,900
impression that my sister all friends

266
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:37,370
don't really understand why I'm

267
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:39,560
presenting in such a meticulously

268
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:41,510
feminine way like they think I'm wearing

269
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:43,310
ombre lips at 11:00 a.m. because I'm

270
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:45,650
playing some kind of cloud game which I

271
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:47,029
am but also if one person calls me sir

272
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:48,680
that's gonna ruin my day

273
00:09:47,029 --> 00:09:50,450
so I'm desperately throwing glitter

274
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:52,700
spaghetti at the wall and hopes the

275
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:53,899
light catches some glimmer of womanhood

276
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:55,820
I think butch are gender non-conforming

277
00:09:53,899 --> 00:09:58,010
since women sometimes sight I

278
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:59,450
hyper-feminine trans women because they

279
00:09:58,010 --> 00:10:01,190
don't identify with this vision of

280
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:02,990
womanhood at all and they've had a

281
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:05,209
struggle since childhood against a

282
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:07,189
society that's told them they have to be

283
00:10:05,209 --> 00:10:08,720
feminine and I completely sympathize her

284
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:10,699
thought I think there should be more

285
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:13,339
gender freedom less coercion less

286
00:10:10,699 --> 00:10:15,439
restriction but also I have had to fight

287
00:10:13,339 --> 00:10:18,050
against the same society that told me I

288
00:10:15,439 --> 00:10:20,809
should really really really not be this

289
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:24,230
so I feel like we should be able to form

290
00:10:20,809 --> 00:10:26,809
some kind of solidarity here one concern

291
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:28,699
three abolish gender but you should be

292
00:10:26,809 --> 00:10:30,559
moving beyond the patriarchal constructs

293
00:10:28,699 --> 00:10:33,110
of masculinity and femininity not

294
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:36,079
conforming to them real feminism aims to

295
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:38,179
abolish gender not reinforce it abolish

296
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:40,189
gender well that sounds like an

297
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:43,610
ambitious project for one transsexual

298
00:10:40,189 --> 00:10:46,670
but I mean I'll give it a try Sylvanas

299
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:48,259
be praised no nails no makeup I'm

300
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:50,589
wearing a nice little gender-neutral

301
00:10:48,259 --> 00:10:53,449
robe moment I did it everyone I

302
00:10:50,589 --> 00:10:55,759
abolished gender well I guess long hair

303
00:10:53,449 --> 00:11:00,290
is still a gender signifier so I should

304
00:10:55,759 --> 00:11:03,529
probably get rid of that see the feeling

305
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:05,389
a little position my body is still

306
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:07,189
gendered and there's a gendered cadence

307
00:11:05,389 --> 00:11:09,110
to my voice so what I'm gonna do is just

308
00:11:07,189 --> 00:11:11,240
hold my hands up genderless Lee and

309
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:15,759
speak in a genderless robot voice my

310
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:19,100
name is 5 4 6 6 4 1 7 I have no gender

311
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:20,779
patriarchy is over I guess English is

312
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:22,069
still patriarchal language right so I

313
00:11:20,779 --> 00:11:26,389
should probably be communicating with a

314
00:11:22,069 --> 00:11:28,279
series of genderless sounds I can't

315
00:11:26,389 --> 00:11:30,199
stand this [ __ ] this look maybe a

316
00:11:28,279 --> 00:11:32,240
polishing gender is a good idea like

317
00:11:30,199 --> 00:11:33,949
wouldn't it be better if your genitals

318
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,449
at Birth didn't determine what kind of

319
00:11:33,949 --> 00:11:37,309
life you could live but that is a

320
00:11:35,449 --> 00:11:38,449
utopian project requiring massive

321
00:11:37,309 --> 00:11:40,369
systemic change

322
00:11:38,449 --> 00:11:43,129
kind of like abolish borders your

323
00:11:40,369 --> 00:11:44,509
utopian pipe dream is valid and denying

324
00:11:43,129 --> 00:11:47,209
trans people their gender identity

325
00:11:44,509 --> 00:11:48,949
because a bullish gender is kind of like

326
00:11:47,209 --> 00:11:50,779
denying citizenship to immigrants

327
00:11:48,949 --> 00:11:52,189
because abolish borders like you're

328
00:11:50,779 --> 00:11:54,230
targeting the people who are the most

329
00:11:52,189 --> 00:11:56,329
vulnerable under the present system and

330
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:58,309
then leveraging that system against them

331
00:11:56,329 --> 00:11:59,420
under the pretense of abolishing it you

332
00:11:58,309 --> 00:12:01,459
know you don't see gender critical

333
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:03,139
feminists and Kim Kardashian's Instagram

334
00:12:01,459 --> 00:12:05,480
comments like are you wearing a dress

335
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:07,129
Kim you creepy misogynist you should be

336
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:09,259
abolishing gender not reinforcing

337
00:12:07,129 --> 00:12:11,269
stereotypes designed to oppress women oh

338
00:12:09,259 --> 00:12:12,529
they don't attack the gender expression

339
00:12:11,269 --> 00:12:14,660
of people with power and influence

340
00:12:12,529 --> 00:12:16,699
they're all on Twitter harassing some

341
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:17,699
poor newly out trans women with 200

342
00:12:16,699 --> 00:12:19,410
followers and

343
00:12:17,699 --> 00:12:20,790
calling her a creepy man and mocking her

344
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:22,679
for being feminine ineptly

345
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:24,869
or being too feminine or not being

346
00:12:22,679 --> 00:12:26,699
feminine enough it's almost like when

347
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:29,369
they say abolish gender what they really

348
00:12:26,699 --> 00:12:31,350
mean is abolish trans people it's almost

349
00:12:29,369 --> 00:12:32,939
like this is a hate movement hiding

350
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:35,549
behind a handful of pseudo feminist

351
00:12:32,939 --> 00:12:39,059
platitudes but surely I must be missing

352
00:12:35,549 --> 00:12:42,089
something your concern for male

353
00:12:39,059 --> 00:12:43,829
privilege it is absolutely typical of

354
00:12:42,089 --> 00:12:45,449
male privilege and entitlement but you

355
00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:47,249
think you can just claim womanhood for

356
00:12:45,449 --> 00:12:49,589
yourself without living any of the

357
00:12:47,249 --> 00:12:51,600
struggle that entails so look I'm a

358
00:12:49,589 --> 00:12:53,639
successful white middle-class trans

359
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,949
woman and the grand scheme of things I'm

360
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:59,489
really not very oppressed I may not be

361
00:12:55,949 --> 00:13:00,629
the 1% but I am the [ __ ] 1% so I don't

362
00:12:59,489 --> 00:13:02,309
like to complain about every little

363
00:13:00,629 --> 00:13:05,699
micro aggression I experience because

364
00:13:02,309 --> 00:13:07,319
under the circumstances it just seems a

365
00:13:05,699 --> 00:13:09,959
little gauche and I don't like things

366
00:13:07,319 --> 00:13:11,730
that are goes but I've has his feminists

367
00:13:09,959 --> 00:13:13,739
of my race and class tell me that I have

368
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:16,129
no idea what it's like to be talked over

369
00:13:13,739 --> 00:13:18,299
and interrupted by men actually

370
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:20,069
Kropotkin or to experience street

371
00:13:18,299 --> 00:13:21,239
harassment or to have to treat every

372
00:13:20,069 --> 00:13:23,970
first date like a potentially

373
00:13:21,239 --> 00:13:26,039
life-threatening situation and it's just

374
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:27,569
bizarre to me that they think that like

375
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:29,579
what do you think my experience in the

376
00:13:27,569 --> 00:13:31,589
world is you think men treat me as their

377
00:13:29,579 --> 00:13:32,879
equal you think Street harasser they're

378
00:13:31,589 --> 00:13:35,189
gonna treat me with dignity and respect

379
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:35,819
because I have a Y chromosome hey

380
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:38,129
beautiful

381
00:13:35,819 --> 00:13:40,619
where are you going baby where you going

382
00:13:38,129 --> 00:13:42,809
oh it's training excuse me sir my

383
00:13:40,619 --> 00:13:45,869
mistake please proceed freely to your

384
00:13:42,809 --> 00:13:47,399
destination come on people use your

385
00:13:45,869 --> 00:13:49,499
heads when you have a Germaine Greer

386
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:50,970
calling trans woman it what do you think

387
00:13:49,499 --> 00:13:52,559
the guy in the steps of the liquor store

388
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:54,989
is gonna say when a trans woman doesn't

389
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:56,970
pass it's not like society simply treats

390
00:13:54,989 --> 00:13:59,669
her like a man no you get treated his

391
00:13:56,970 --> 00:14:01,679
monster gender pronouns it and spit and

392
00:13:59,669 --> 00:14:03,779
male privilege is not a good description

393
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:05,789
of that experience at all once you start

394
00:14:03,779 --> 00:14:07,379
passing as a woman it's really a step up

395
00:14:05,789 --> 00:14:09,779
even though women get treated bad

396
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:12,629
because it's still better to be a she

397
00:14:09,779 --> 00:14:14,160
than an it now gender critical feminists

398
00:14:12,629 --> 00:14:14,500
are really skeptical of the whole notion

399
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,270
of

400
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:18,340
passing they think they can always clock

401
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:20,800
at ran and they assume everyone else can

402
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:22,390
too but that's just not reality

403
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:24,310
I mean I'm only a year and a half into

404
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:26,770
my transition and at this point if had

405
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:28,690
zero surgeries and it's been like six

406
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:30,640
months since I was last misgendered off

407
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:32,710
line I mean a person with a good eye for

408
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:33,640
it will probably clock me and maybe a

409
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:35,440
lot of people have just been

410
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:37,420
indoctrinated into politically correct

411
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,310
gender ideology but like you really

412
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:40,870
think the gas station attendant and the

413
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:42,850
nail technicians and the heating and

414
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:45,820
plumbing guy are all calling me miss and

415
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:47,230
man because of post-modernism I know

416
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:48,850
some of you were gonna sneak off to your

417
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:50,710
shitty little rad femme forums and

418
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:52,870
obsess over how may only unclog Obul I

419
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:54,520
am but like at the end of the day what

420
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:57,970
am I going to trust the deranged hate

421
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:59,650
posting of 25 frothing Ananse or every

422
00:14:57,970 --> 00:15:01,300
social interaction I've had for months

423
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:03,520
I'm so sorry you can't handle it I'm

424
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:07,680
natural fish I'm ahi tuna and your

425
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:07,680
mackerels 20 take a [ __ ] sip babes

426
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:16,030
concern 5 male socialization so you had

427
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:17,950
a male upbringing you've never

428
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:19,330
experienced the traumas of girlhood you

429
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:20,800
benefited from male privilege for

430
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:22,630
decades and now you think none of that

431
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:24,400
matters you are who you are because of

432
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:26,710
how you were socialized not because of

433
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:31,630
how you dress alright it's time to crack

434
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:33,850
open the nuanced so in the one hand

435
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:35,380
you're partially right I have no idea

436
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:36,820
what it's like to be cat cold as a 9

437
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:38,290
year old girl or what that does to a

438
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:39,730
child's psyche that kind of thing

439
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:41,290
doesn't start happening to me till I was

440
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:42,910
an adult when I knew what I was getting

441
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:44,410
into and was ready for it that's very

442
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:46,630
different from what sis women go through

443
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:48,100
my upbringing and adolescence has more

444
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:50,440
in common with a typical man than a

445
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:52,300
typical woman and many of my experiences

446
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:54,400
from those days I simply can't make

447
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:56,470
sense of as female experiences I

448
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:58,870
absolutely benefited from male privilege

449
00:15:56,470 --> 00:16:01,120
and it did influence who I was and who I

450
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:02,950
was in my late teens and early 20s was

451
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,600
an anti-feminist [ __ ] who had no

452
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:06,310
idea what women go through and I feel

453
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:08,230
ashamed and alone in admitting that

454
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:10,210
because in trans discourse it's just

455
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:11,830
accepted it's obvious that trans men

456
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:13,540
know what it's like to be raised as

457
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:15,610
women and to be influenced by those

458
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:17,110
formative female experiences but when it

459
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:18,940
comes to the early life experiences of

460
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:20,590
trans women we're supposed to say when I

461
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:22,690
was five years old I loved wearing my

462
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:24,520
mom's high heels or else say nothing at

463
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:24,980
all there's that wonderful quotation

464
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,510
from

465
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:28,220
the applause where she described as the

466
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:30,350
way living as a woman stifles an

467
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:33,740
adventurous spirit and her longing for

468
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:36,709
male experience yes my consuming desires

469
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:39,889
to mingle with road crews sailors and

470
00:16:36,709 --> 00:16:43,310
soldiers barroom regulars to be part of

471
00:16:39,889 --> 00:16:47,300
a scene anonymous listening recording

472
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:50,329
all this is spoilt by the fact that I am

473
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:53,149
a girl a female always supposedly in

474
00:16:50,329 --> 00:16:55,339
danger of assault and battery my

475
00:16:53,149 --> 00:16:58,490
consuming interest in men and their

476
00:16:55,339 --> 00:17:01,190
lives is often misconstrued as a desire

477
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:04,520
to seduce them or as an invitation to

478
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:07,250
intimacy yes god I want to talk to

479
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:09,709
everybody as deeply as I can I want to

480
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:13,669
be able to sleep in an open field to

481
00:17:09,709 --> 00:17:16,040
travel west to walk freely at night so I

482
00:17:13,669 --> 00:17:18,410
got to do all that my early 20s and what

483
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:21,410
I discovered is I hate sleeping in open

484
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:23,689
fields I despise the West and I'd really

485
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:25,459
rather stay inside collecting ceramics

486
00:17:23,689 --> 00:17:27,230
and sucking dick now I'm not saying that

487
00:17:25,459 --> 00:17:29,000
makes me a woman and I'm not saying that

488
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:30,890
Sylvia Plath is a man because she wanted

489
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,660
to slam back brewskis with road crews

490
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:34,880
for reasons that are inconceivable to me

491
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:37,400
what I am saying is that when I hit my

492
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:39,860
mid-20s I realized that I was inhabiting

493
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:41,540
a gender body and sexual persona that

494
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:43,250
were drastically wrong for me and I

495
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:44,870
tried every possible alternative to

496
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:46,640
transitioning before realizing that I

497
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:49,520
had an irrepressible need to become a

498
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:51,440
woman so I changed and when I changed

499
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:53,419
society's treatment of me changed

500
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:56,179
socialization doesn't end with childhood

501
00:17:53,419 --> 00:17:58,640
it's a lifelong process for example when

502
00:17:56,179 --> 00:18:00,830
I transitioned my friends family fans

503
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:02,929
enemies stalkers and radical feminist

504
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:04,970
haters started commenting on my physical

505
00:18:02,929 --> 00:18:06,919
appearance about 20 to 30 times more

506
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:08,540
often and I had to get used to that

507
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:11,030
being something that matters a lot more

508
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:13,160
that said resocialize ation takes time

509
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:15,140
and sometimes trans people who are early

510
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:16,730
in transition have most of that process

511
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:18,320
ahead of them I also think we have to

512
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:20,720
take into account the age at which a

513
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:24,260
person transitions Kym Patras the most

514
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:26,510
we Stan Lee's do I stand

515
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:28,070
always idea she transitioned as a child

516
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:29,260
and I imagined was socialized

517
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:33,150
more or less the same as

518
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:34,720
woman whereas Caitlyn Jenner host well

519
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:36,010
just him

520
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,930
she made millions of dollars in men's

521
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:39,940
sports she had six children by three

522
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:42,130
wives she transitioned in retirement at

523
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:43,510
age 65 and told BuzzFeed that the

524
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:46,840
hardest part of being a woman is

525
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:48,520
figuring out what to wear this is the

526
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:50,590
only trans woman most people have heard

527
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:52,120
of it makes me want to cry like I'm not

528
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:53,860
saying that Caitlyn Jenner isn't a woman

529
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:55,450
but I am saying that anyone who wants to

530
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:57,310
argue that male priviledge hasn't shaped

531
00:18:55,450 --> 00:19:00,130
her perspective doesn't have a leg to

532
00:18:57,310 --> 00:19:02,260
stand on but also trans women often

533
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:04,090
don't experience male socialization the

534
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:05,500
way sis men do many trans women are

535
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:07,450
feminine and queer before they

536
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:09,190
transition and have always experienced a

537
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:10,690
kind of femmephobia that is rooted in

538
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:12,310
misogyny some trans women also

539
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:14,680
identified as women years before

540
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:16,150
transitioning and internalized society's

541
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:17,980
messaging about women more than

542
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:19,570
society's messaging about man

543
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:21,700
now the still not the same as living in

544
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:23,050
society as a girl from birth but it's

545
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:25,270
also pretty different from the

546
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:26,650
socialization of most assess man I think

547
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:28,240
the reason some trans women feel the

548
00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:30,430
need to argue that trans women never

549
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:32,800
experience male privilege is that a lot

550
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:35,140
of turfs use male privilege as a proxy

551
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:37,990
for calling us men pull up your zipper

552
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:39,970
your male privilege is hanging out I

553
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:41,800
suspect the reason this is such a major

554
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:43,330
talking point for many gender critical

555
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:45,700
feminists is that there's an element

556
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:47,710
here of stolen valor the sense of

557
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:49,420
injustice that people are claiming their

558
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:51,370
identity without experiencing their

559
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:53,940
oppression it reminds me of what in the

560
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:56,620
trans community are called trans medical

561
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:58,480
assist the only real trans people or

562
00:19:56,620 --> 00:20:00,760
those who experience agonizing dysphoria

563
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,230
in both cases there's a sense that the

564
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:05,050
essential thing that confirms your

565
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:07,510
identity is pain what it is to be trans

566
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:10,030
is to despise your body what it is to be

567
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:12,310
a woman is to be brutalized by men you

568
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:14,050
didn't suffer like I've suffered you

569
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:15,790
don't know what it's like you know I'm

570
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:17,770
tempted to strike back by saying that

571
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:20,140
you don't know it is like to occupy an

572
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:21,400
identity so stigmatized that most of the

573
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:23,380
people who are attracted to you in

574
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:24,940
private are too ashamed to admit it in

575
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:26,710
public you don't know what it's like to

576
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:28,690
have a body so non normative that you're

577
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:30,880
shut out of whole areas of society I

578
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:32,860
could go on but this America's next top

579
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,660
victim contest does nothing but to

580
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:36,430
provoke infighting between trans women

581
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:38,440
insists women at a time when we should

582
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:40,660
be marching side-by-side to destroy

583
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:41,600
video games forever hashtag yes all

584
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:44,630
gamers

585
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:46,460
while a concern sex reproductive

586
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:47,870
oppression you don't know what it's like

587
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:50,240
to grow up being ashamed for your

588
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:51,800
periods to fear unwanted pregnancies you

589
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:55,870
have to fight for your right to abortion

590
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:59,240
to bear the pain of childbirth well yeah

591
00:20:55,870 --> 00:21:01,670
that's true my inner rod fem sways and a

592
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:03,320
gentle victorious samba I do think it's

593
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:05,150
important for trans women to stand in

594
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:07,310
solidarity with sis women on issues like

595
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:08,870
period equity and abortion rights and to

596
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:10,640
learn about the experiences assist women

597
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:12,380
to form a more complete understanding of

598
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:14,510
the female condition but of course no

599
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:16,790
individual woman experiences all the

600
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:18,110
things women experience and individual

601
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:19,760
women understand the meaning of

602
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:21,980
womanhood in drastically different ways

603
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:23,900
for some women having babies is the most

604
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:26,120
essentially woman the experience for

605
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:28,370
others maybe it's having an abortion I

606
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:30,230
mean not actually but you know turfs

607
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:32,510
pretend it is down the [ __ ] for me

608
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:34,250
it's receiving 12 paragraph emails in my

609
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:35,540
business inbox from married men

610
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:38,000
struggling through the existential

611
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:40,010
crisis of some kind of [ __ ] themed

612
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,140
sexual awakening also do you want to be

613
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:44,900
a gust to my podcasts free speech radio

614
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:46,790
but also not all women experienced their

615
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:48,260
womanhood is essentially oppressive or

616
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:50,210
centered around the pain of reproductive

617
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:52,040
capacity when Shania Twain's saying man

618
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:53,900
I feel like a woman she wasn't talking

619
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:55,550
about having a coat hanger abortion in

620
00:21:53,900 --> 00:22:01,490
the bathroom of a Greyhound station in

621
00:21:55,550 --> 00:22:04,790
Chattanooga man I feel like [ __ ] at

622
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:06,860
seven erasing female vocabulary trans

623
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:08,480
activists are erasing the vocabulary

624
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:10,310
needed to discuss women's bodies and

625
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:12,140
women's oppression you're now expected

626
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:14,210
to talk about pregnant people and

627
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:15,380
immense traitors just to appease the

628
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:18,560
gender ideologues

629
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:23,920
well I for one am NOT a menstruate er I

630
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:26,330
am a WOM B Y n and I will not be erased

631
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:28,190
okay if you've heard the terms men

632
00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:30,200
straighter or pregnant people and are

633
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:32,870
thinking what the [ __ ] kind of Orwellian

634
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:35,540
Newspeak gender cuckoldry is that take a

635
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:37,400
deep breath clear mind here's the team

636
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:38,900
some medical organizations have recently

637
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:41,540
begun using the term pregnant people

638
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:43,460
instead of pregnant women and in 2016

639
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:45,050
Planned Parenthood included the word men

640
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:46,190
Streeters in a tweet about the repeal of

641
00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:48,230
a tampon tar

642
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:50,240
this has prompted some conservative turf

643
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:52,039
and Christian publications to post

644
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:53,720
panicked commentaries warning that the

645
00:22:52,039 --> 00:22:56,210
entire concept of womanhood is being

646
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:58,009
erased but in fact medical language that

647
00:22:56,210 --> 00:23:00,559
assume is that everyone with a uterus is

648
00:22:58,009 --> 00:23:02,179
a woman erases trans men or non-binary

649
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:04,730
people who menstruate and get pregnant

650
00:23:02,179 --> 00:23:06,799
so Saeng pregnant women in this context

651
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:08,990
erases them whereas saying pregnant

652
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:10,580
people includes them anthesis women and

653
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:12,919
doesn't erase anyone except for

654
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:14,629
Cincinnatians because we all know there

655
00:23:12,919 --> 00:23:16,279
are not people take your shitty chile

656
00:23:14,629 --> 00:23:18,320
elsewhere have a woman not a god damn

657
00:23:16,279 --> 00:23:20,240
men straighter what kind of misogynistic

658
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:22,250
madness is it to reduce women to their

659
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:24,230
capacity to bleed I actually agree with

660
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:26,450
you that the word men straighter sounds

661
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:28,070
pretty humanizing and the trans men I've

662
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:29,720
talked to about this aren't the biggest

663
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:31,250
fans of it either so notice it takes a

664
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:34,220
while to settle on language that's both

665
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:35,960
inclusive and usable and my prediction

666
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:38,299
is that men straighter is is not gonna

667
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:40,519
work out maybe people who men straight

668
00:23:38,299 --> 00:23:44,389
but I can't I just say woman that's what

669
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:46,789
I am you can't just say woman that is

670
00:23:44,389 --> 00:23:48,580
what you are no one is asking that you

671
00:23:46,789 --> 00:23:50,450
stop referring to yourself as a woman

672
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:52,309
institutional medical language is

673
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:54,500
designed to be inclusive and therefore

674
00:23:52,309 --> 00:23:56,330
impersonal no one is proposing that we

675
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:59,120
stop calling individual women pregnant

676
00:23:56,330 --> 00:24:01,580
women or expectant mothers your obvious

677
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:03,440
misogyny is naked ly exposed I noticed

678
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:05,330
it's only female anatomy or trying to

679
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,950
erase I noticed you're not suggesting

680
00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:10,039
doctors start saying people with

681
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:12,080
prostate so I am definitely suggesting

682
00:24:10,039 --> 00:24:14,029
odd but trans activists are invading

683
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:16,340
feminist spaces in telling women we

684
00:24:14,029 --> 00:24:18,470
can't discuss our own bodies I have no

685
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:20,600
problem with cysts feminists discussing

686
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:22,909
or celebrating periods or wearing [ __ ]

687
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:24,529
hats at political marches were free

688
00:24:22,909 --> 00:24:26,690
bleeding all over the National Mall I

689
00:24:24,529 --> 00:24:29,059
mean someone has to the National Mall is

690
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:30,440
not gonna bleed on itself I totally get

691
00:24:29,059 --> 00:24:32,269
why says feminists would want to

692
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:34,519
celebrate the reproductive Anatomy and

693
00:24:32,269 --> 00:24:36,529
defiance of a society the routinely

694
00:24:34,519 --> 00:24:38,840
shames and subjugates them for it the

695
00:24:36,529 --> 00:24:40,399
problem arises only when menstruation or

696
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:42,740
reproductive Anatomy are used to miss

697
00:24:40,399 --> 00:24:45,019
gender trans men or exclude WOM homes

698
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:48,940
stuff not bleed I mean trans women do

699
00:24:45,019 --> 00:24:48,940
bleed but Volney when we cut ourselves

700
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:59,980
to be a sad Tran what what concern eight

701
00:24:55,600 --> 00:25:02,169
turf is a slur turf is a slur designed

702
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:04,330
to silence women nay it is hate speech

703
00:25:02,169 --> 00:25:06,730
designed to incite violence against

704
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:08,590
women the word turf is a pejorative for

705
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:11,200
a person who dresses up transphobia with

706
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:13,000
radical feminism but it's not a slur a

707
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,980
slur is a pejorative the target

708
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,049
someone's race religion gender or

709
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:18,700
sexuality the word misogynist is

710
00:25:17,049 --> 00:25:20,679
pejorative it has only negative

711
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:22,990
connotations and is often used as an

712
00:25:20,679 --> 00:25:25,120
insult but it's not a slur it targets

713
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:27,039
bigoted behavior and beliefs not a type

714
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:29,710
of person the same is true of the word

715
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:31,690
turf it's a derogatory term for beliefs

716
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:33,940
and behaviors that deserve to be

717
00:25:31,690 --> 00:25:36,370
derogated the term gender critical is

718
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:38,470
really a euphemism recently created to

719
00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:40,419
replace turf with a phrase that doesn't

720
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:42,400
have such negative connotations it's

721
00:25:40,419 --> 00:25:44,740
perfectly analogous to the phrase race

722
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,970
realist which was invented by racists

723
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:47,650
wanting a more flattering and

724
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:49,870
respectable description of their beliefs

725
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:51,640
I've used the term gender critical in

726
00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:53,950
this video to be inviting to fence

727
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:55,570
sitters but I refuse to cooperate with

728
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:57,940
racists who want me to use their

729
00:25:55,570 --> 00:26:00,669
euphemisms and I generally do the same

730
00:25:57,940 --> 00:26:02,830
with turfs now I'm a very agreeable non

731
00:26:00,669 --> 00:26:04,510
confrontational person I usually like to

732
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:06,429
call people by whatever they want to be

733
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:08,890
called but when it comes to race realist

734
00:26:06,429 --> 00:26:10,720
or gender critical every time I use

735
00:26:08,890 --> 00:26:12,610
these phrases I'm essentially becoming

736
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:15,130
an accomplice in their scheme to

737
00:26:12,610 --> 00:26:17,500
legitimize bigotry and I have especially

738
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:19,659
little patience for turf requests for

739
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:21,820
linguistic decorum since most of the

740
00:26:19,659 --> 00:26:24,820
language used by turfs is specifically

741
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:26,860
designed to be maximally hurtful harmful

742
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:29,169
and insulting to trans people for

743
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:32,110
instance turfs refer to any and all

744
00:26:29,169 --> 00:26:33,010
trans related surgery as mutilation they

745
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:35,559
call trans women

746
00:26:33,010 --> 00:26:38,409
Timms an acronym for trans identified

747
00:26:35,559 --> 00:26:40,720
males and trans men tiffs trans

748
00:26:38,409 --> 00:26:43,120
identified females obviously with the

749
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:44,650
intent of mockery and misgendering just

750
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:46,960
to give you a sample of typical turf

751
00:26:44,650 --> 00:26:48,789
pros here are a couple comments from

752
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,440
literally the first threat I saw on the

753
00:26:48,789 --> 00:26:52,299
gender critical subreddit while I was

754
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:53,650
working on this video and I have to

755
00:26:52,299 --> 00:26:56,830
admit to consider

756
00:26:53,650 --> 00:26:59,070
more contempt for the likes of since he

757
00:26:56,830 --> 00:27:02,080
makes a point of taking selfies with

758
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:05,170
ridiculous insulting to women facial

759
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:06,910
expressions I also get a good love at

760
00:27:05,170 --> 00:27:09,730
Tim's putting their hands up to their

761
00:27:06,910 --> 00:27:11,950
shins they're trying to look both dainty

762
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:13,900
and to hide their Adam's apple but it

763
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:17,470
only draws more attention to their

764
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:19,660
enormous man hands I saw an AGP photo

765
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:22,090
shoot with this Neanderthal and his

766
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:25,330
fifties was posing with one leg up like

767
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:29,890
a flamingo his hands dainty Attis yeah

768
00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:34,810
in every photo even group ones at events

769
00:27:29,890 --> 00:27:36,610
no I was just grossed out so there it is

770
00:27:34,810 --> 00:27:38,140
that's what this is really about

771
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:40,210
in this video I've gone through a list

772
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:41,950
of gender critical concerns and I've

773
00:27:40,210 --> 00:27:43,600
provided responses I hope the average

774
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:45,670
person will find fair but I would be

775
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:47,380
lying to you by omission if I were to

776
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:49,390
end this video without being real with

777
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:52,360
you about what the core of the gender

778
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:54,400
critical movement is actually about see

779
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:56,680
what turfs do in public is advance what

780
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:58,300
on the surface or a series of feminist

781
00:27:56,680 --> 00:28:00,190
critiques of trans people for example

782
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:01,900
the critique the hyper-feminine trans

783
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:04,150
women are reinforcing misogynistic

784
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:05,950
stereotypes designed to oppress women at

785
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:07,810
a glance this appears to be a critique

786
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:09,340
of the way some trans women behave and

787
00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:11,260
present themselves but in the next

788
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:13,240
breath these same tourists will argue

789
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:15,340
that trans women are mannish unfeminine

790
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:17,470
perverts who are forcing masculinity and

791
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:19,450
two females faces so if trans women

792
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:21,580
being feminine is bad and trans women

793
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:23,740
being masculine is bad then there really

794
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:26,380
is no way that trans women could behave

795
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:28,600
the turfs would accept so in fact what

796
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:30,220
hearths really oppose is not trans women

797
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:33,190
being feminine for trans women being

798
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:34,900
masculine but trans women being trans

799
00:28:33,190 --> 00:28:36,790
women in other words the fundamental

800
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:40,630
issue underlying all these phony

801
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:42,730
concerns is transphobia simple animosity

802
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:44,890
towards trans people's very existence

803
00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:46,780
and it's pretty easy to recognize that

804
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:48,400
just from the tone they use when they

805
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:50,020
talk about us when you read through the

806
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:52,270
gender critical subreddit or turf

807
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:54,520
Twitter what you see is just the

808
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:57,130
flimsiest cloak of feminist platitudes

809
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:59,860
draped over a jagged thorn tangle a

810
00:28:57,130 --> 00:29:02,380
visceral disgust and targeted hate the

811
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:04,270
pure exuberant malice of it all is not

812
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:05,080
even disguised in the Germaine Greer

00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:20,020
burgeoning this Neanderthal in his

819
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:22,450
fifties ridiculous insulting to women

820
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:24,880
facial expressions now I was just

821
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:27,460
grossed out what gender critical

822
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:30,340
feminism really amounts to is a baroque

823
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:33,490
Palace of rationalizations built on a

824
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:35,890
foundation of pure disgust in this

825
00:29:33,490 --> 00:29:37,660
respect it's just like homophobia you

826
00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:39,280
know I came of age when gay marriage was

827
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:41,470
the most contentious social debate and

828
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:43,210
the arguments people made that marriage

829
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:45,460
was under attack that the children would

830
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:47,380
be traumatized that bestiality would be

831
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:49,030
next that this tiny minority was

832
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:51,370
undermining all our institutions with

833
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:53,890
their outrageous demands with all just

834
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:56,770
nonsense if you got a conservative drunk

835
00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:58,330
as I used to be able to do Sylvia I wish

836
00:29:56,770 --> 00:30:00,100
I could give you what I had he would

837
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:02,680
just blurt out the truth which was that

838
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:05,350
the sight of two grown men locking lips

839
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:07,300
made him one of vom homophobia and

840
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:09,640
transphobia do not originate in the

841
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:11,770
frontal cortex they come from the lizard

842
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:14,170
brain disgust response we evolved to

843
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:17,020
deal with blood infection vomit feces

844
00:30:14,170 --> 00:30:18,850
flies the hairy paw the stubble

845
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:20,860
burgeoning through the pancake makeup

846
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:23,230
yeah it's a disgust

847
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:24,370
I can recognize at a glance because it's

848
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:27,220
the same disgust

849
00:30:24,370 --> 00:30:29,230
I felt toward myself for years is the

850
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:31,510
disgust I felt when I clocked a trans

851
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:33,640
woman on the El platform in Chicago five

852
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:35,980
years ago and decided then and there to

853
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:37,120
abandon my first attempt to transition

854
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:39,880
its the disgust

855
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:41,800
I still struggle against everyday is the

856
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:44,200
disgust that's always at the bottom of

857
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:46,840
transphobia because transphobia is

858
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:49,090
always the same it always comes from the

859
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:50,830
same place and it's always expressed in

860
00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:53,230
the same kinds of ways I recently

861
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:55,270
rewatched the classic viral video from

862
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:56,890
an old episode of cops where a police

863
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:59,320
officer humiliates a Native American

864
00:30:56,890 --> 00:31:01,180
trans woman named Stephanie yellow hair

865
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:03,580
the power-tripping cop demands to see

866
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:05,650
her ID miss genders her dead names her

867
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:08,110
mocks her clothes and makeup and calls

868
00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:10,330
her a crossdresser it's also repetitive

869
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:12,400
and familiar it's the same arsenal of

870
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:15,370
petty sadism you see in the right-wing

871
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:18,130
press on 4chan on daxing forums on

872
00:31:15,370 --> 00:31:20,080
gender critical reddit it's all the same

873
00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:22,060
what everyone remembers about Stephanie

874
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:23,920
yellow hair is her unbreakable wit and

875
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:26,350
confidence in the face of transphobic

876
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:28,180
abuse the single most iconic moment is

877
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:30,190
when after being grilled in the back of

878
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:32,410
the cop car amid a flurry of dead naming

879
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:36,730
and misgendering she glances back at the

880
00:31:32,410 --> 00:31:39,370
cop and says excuse your beauty okay and

881
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:41,050
to that right there is the single

882
00:31:39,370 --> 00:31:43,630
greatest quality of trans feminine

883
00:31:41,050 --> 00:31:46,540
culture the resilience of trans women

884
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:49,030
the assumption of a regal posture and

885
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:51,280
even the most abject conditions and

886
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:53,200
that's really all you can do because

887
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:56,170
there's just no reasoning a transfer

888
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:57,850
about a bigotry so to any diehard gender

889
00:31:56,170 --> 00:32:00,850

890
