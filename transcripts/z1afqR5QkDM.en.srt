well today my guests will be debating

43
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:16,130
the topic well here's a good one should

44
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,500
it be illegal to use the wrong pronouns

45
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:21,110
for transgender what do you think

46
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:22,819
Annabelle well Jackie liberation from

47
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:25,099
the oppressive institution of gender

48
00:02:22,819 --> 00:02:28,280
begins with freedom of speech for

49
00:02:25,099 --> 00:02:31,069
instance this cat person over here is

50
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:34,160
clearly a biological male in some sort

51
00:02:31,069 --> 00:02:36,260
of costume wig now I of course the court

52
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:38,600
has right to trust however he wishes but

53
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:40,370
the fact remains that pronouns refer as

54
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:46,130
they always have referred to chromosomal

55
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:48,260
sex but perhaps you disagree sir that's

56
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:51,410
a human rights violation I'll smash your

57
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:52,790
[ __ ] face here we have a clear

58
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:55,219
illustration

59
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:57,349
transgender ideology is merely a

60
00:02:55,219 --> 00:02:59,090
smokescreen for male violence against

61
00:02:57,349 --> 00:03:00,769
women and my dude this is being taught

62
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:03,739

children security and I have this caste

64
00:03:03,739 --> 00:03:07,250
seminars law being silenced and

65
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:09,439
something must be done about the

66
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:12,010
encroaching trans agenda taking away

67
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:12,010

00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:14,810
naked people

85
00:04:12,699 --> 00:04:16,970

86
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:20,120

how that works I hate that the heart

89
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,979
wants what it wants

90
00:04:23,419 --> 00:04:26,599
why did you invite me over here anyway I

91
00:04:24,979 --> 00:04:30,169
saw what happened to you on the freedom

92
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:32,659
report and girl girl you cannot be a

93
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:34,490
trans woman on TV threatening people

94
00:04:32,659 --> 00:04:36,440
with a bat you think it's morally wrong

95
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:38,599
to stand up to your oppressors no

96
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:40,669
morally wrong what does that have you

97
00:04:38,599 --> 00:04:42,409
mean it was much worse than morally

98
00:04:40,669 --> 00:04:44,750
wrong it was aesthetically wrong

99
00:04:42,409 --> 00:04:47,120
it was unfeminine little you ever say to

100
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:48,919
me it's bad optics it's bad aesthetics

101
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,930
well it's reality matter at all to you

102
00:04:48,919 --> 00:04:52,520
because the reality is I am a woman and

103
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:54,259
maybe a bunch of ignorant people don't

104
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:56,599
think I look like one but the way things

105
00:04:54,259 --> 00:04:58,039
look isn't all that matters tabby this

106
00:04:56,599 --> 00:04:59,539
is politics have you ever had a

107
00:04:58,039 --> 00:05:01,969
conversation with the average voter

108
00:04:59,539 --> 00:05:04,070
reality plays no role in politics

109
00:05:01,969 --> 00:05:05,440
politics is aesthetics

110
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:07,780
politics is a

111
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:11,260
aesthetics that's literally what fascism

112
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:13,180
is have you even read benjamine fascism

113
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:15,220
is the introduction of aesthetics into

114
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:17,860
political life the military parades the

115
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:19,960
pageantry and communism responds by

116
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:21,970
politicizing art this is what I can't

117
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:24,040
stand about communists you want to turn

118
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:27,340
art into propaganda well art is already

119
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:28,930
ideology ah look instead of ruining art

120
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:32,170
why don't we fight the pageantry of

121
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:33,640
fascism with pageantry of our own and

122
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:40,150
you know who's gonna make that happen

123
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:42,070
oh well funded transwomen you stop that

124
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:43,600
what I'm just trying to monetize a

125
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:45,130
connected engagement community by

126
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,390
strategically leveraging my content

127
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:48,130
creator promotional media brand

128
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:51,040
analytics is that so wrong

129
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:52,540
you're so bougie I'm not the one quoting

130
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:55,000
German philosophers from memory

131
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:56,890
revolutionary philosophers whatever you

132
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,600
need to tell yourself look the point I'm

133
00:05:56,890 --> 00:06:01,360
trying to make is that the world we live

134
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:02,890
in is not a philosophical world think

135
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,630
about Instagram it's all about

136
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:05,560
transforming your life into an envier

137
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:07,180
bull spectacle

138
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:09,790
if you cry yourself to sleep every night

139
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:11,620
who cares no one sees that they only see

140
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:14,860
the show you're putting on okay but life

141
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:16,660
is not a show politics is a show look

142
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:18,100
around you tabby try to understand

143
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:20,050
what's happening to the world the

144
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:23,110
President of the United States is a

145
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:25,390
reality TV star the 21st century is an

146
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:27,190
aesthetic century in history there are

147
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:28,960
ages of reason and there are ages of

148
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:31,540
spectacle and it's important to know

149
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:34,780
what you're in our America our internet

150
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:36,550
is not ancient Athens its Rome and your

151
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:39,040
problem is you think you're in the forum

152
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:40,360
when you're really in the circus I

153
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:42,400
thought you were just criticizing me for

154
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:45,190
being violent no you're against a reason

155
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:47,740
- I'm not against a reason reason is a

156
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:50,169
very powerful aesthetic if you're a man

157
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:52,960
and what if you're a woman oh don't be a

158
00:06:50,169 --> 00:06:54,550
woman that's not a good idea how do you

159
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,890
remember that debate between Blair white

160
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:59,440
and that youtuber with the pink wig what

161
00:06:56,890 --> 00:07:01,540
was her name I don't know she was

162
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,430
relevant back in 2017 anyway this was

163
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:03,820
before she transitioned and in that

164
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:05,410
debate

165
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:07,150
Blair looked like she had two X

166
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:09,190
chromosomes and the other one looked

167
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:10,900
like this awkward Dulli in an anime wig

168
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:13,180
not long in the camera I vaguely

169
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:15,130
remember I think I read an angry blog

170
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:17,260
post about it well the pink wig lost

171
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:19,330
that debate so bad it was embarrassing

172
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:20,979
to watch not really I mean

173
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:25,870
she was right and her arguments were

174
00:07:20,979 --> 00:07:29,080
better ah tabby sweetie honey

175
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:31,360
angel darling princess baby arguments

176
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:33,219
don't matter how pretty you are matters

177
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,469
is this really where you're going with

178
00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:37,360
this tabby if you want to be a public

179
00:07:35,469 --> 00:07:39,909
figure so to her later you're gonna need

180
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,530
to take the trans girl black pill oh boy

181
00:07:39,909 --> 00:07:41,979
if you're a trans woman in the public

182
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:43,780
eye

183
00:07:41,979 --> 00:07:46,060
what matters is one thing and one thing

184
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:49,050
only and it's always been the thing that

185
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:52,810
matters why the realness

186
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:53,469

193
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:06,789
real conversation here we all know what

194
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:08,469
it means I don't know what it means

195
00:08:06,789 --> 00:08:10,539
women have a lot of different looks

196
00:08:08,469 --> 00:08:13,029
they're bold women bearded women

197
00:08:10,539 --> 00:08:14,949
muscular women wide shouldered women and

198
00:08:13,029 --> 00:08:17,259
what is society's opinion about those

199
00:08:14,949 --> 00:08:18,759
bald bearded wide shouldered women is

200
00:08:17,259 --> 00:08:20,860

dress again the dress is the last of my

202
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:24,849
concerns I mean where do I even start

203
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:27,520
with this you're wearing combat boots

204
00:08:24,849 --> 00:08:29,650
you cannot be wearing combat boots why

205
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:31,509
not a lot of cysts women wear them since

206
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:33,760
women well they're hopeless aren't they

207
00:08:31,509 --> 00:08:35,649
fully clickable so you want me to look

208
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:38,140
like a woman without imitating sits

209
00:08:35,649 --> 00:08:40,240
women yes do not under any circumstances

210
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:41,469
imitate this women they have no idea

211
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,479
what they're doing well where does your

212
00:08:41,469 --> 00:08:46,930
idea of womanhood even come from then

213
00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:48,699
does a Vika viably huh the archetype of

214
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:50,079
the eternal feminine and where does that

215
00:08:48,699 --> 00:08:54,220
come from

216
00:08:50,079 --> 00:08:55,720
poets teenage gay boys on Instagram the

217
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:58,149
only people with any coherent vision of

218
00:08:55,720 --> 00:09:01,690
contemporary womanhood that's insanity

219
00:08:58,149 --> 00:09:02,550
is it tabby look at my face look at this

220
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:04,990
highlight

221
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:08,800
does that look like the product of

222
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:10,660
insanity to you I mean yeah kind of who

223
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:13,180
puts on that much makeup to drink tea at

224
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:15,399
home good banter well done but trans

225
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:17,589
women have to overdo it you need to be

226
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:19,510
so good at makeup that every sis women

227
00:09:17,589 --> 00:09:21,250
you know comes to you for advice you

228
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:23,620
need to toss your hair and cross your

229
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:25,990
legs you need to smile even at people

230
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:26,700
who hate you eliminate every aggressive

231
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:29,340
impulse

232
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:32,490
you must be a blossom floating along the

233
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:36,180
surface of a stream your hands are not

234
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:38,640
tools their ornaments at the ends of

235
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:40,710
your arms so you literally are what

236
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:43,530
turfs think trans women are literally a

237
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:45,810
man's idea of a woman well men have the

238
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:47,430
power men make the rules and it's

239
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:49,680
ultimately men who are the judges of

240
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:51,540
womanhood so you can't really blame me

241
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,980
for having to deal with that situation I

242
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:54,570
can blame you for dealing with it by

243
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:56,870
demanding we all conform to a bunch of

244
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:59,580
ridiculous stereotypes not stereotypes

245
00:09:56,870 --> 00:10:01,860
performances you look philosophy so much

246
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:04,170
having you read Judith Butler gender is

247
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:06,870
performance we're all born naked and the

248
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:09,570
rest is literally drag womanhood is not

249
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:12,330
what you are it's what you do and trans

250
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:13,770
women have to be virtuosos of womaning

251
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:15,510
so according to you there's no

252
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:16,860
difference between a trans woman in a

253
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:19,230
drag queen no you're misinterpreting

254
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:20,640
what I'm saying I don't mean performance

255
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:21,480
in the sense of pretending to be

256
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,280
something you're not

257
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:25,320
I mean performance in the sense of

258
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:27,690
everything you do the way you style

259
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:30,210
yourself your posture the way you speak

260
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:32,340
an authentic performance is just a

261
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:32,730
habitual performance and nothing more

262
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,920
than that

263
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:37,620
so trans women just starting their

264
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:40,290
transition are pretending to be women I

265
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:42,690
mean isn't that kind of what it felt

266
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:44,580
like you transition the same way you get

267
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:46,410
anywhere in life you fake it till you

268
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:48,150
make it so according to you a trans

269
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:50,100
woman it's just a full-time drag queen

270
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:51,780
that's what any woman is what about

271
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:53,760
gender nonconforming assists women

272
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:55,680
they're not doing womanhood in that way

273
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,600
well yeah that's why those women are

274
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,940
marginalized they're going off the grid

275
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,680
of what society recognizes as a

276
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:03,540
womanhood you don't want to end up like

277
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,130
that do you and hold on are you saying

278
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:07,920
that of a sis man dresses like a woman

279
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:10,020
talks like a woman takes female hormones

280
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,880
is gendered female but other people and

281
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:14,100
spends his whole life pretending to be a

282
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:17,910
trans woman that is literally as much of

283
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:19,590
a woman as we are yeah that's absurd but

284
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:22,200
it's absurd because the example is

285
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:24,270
absurd no sis man would do that it's

286
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:26,580
like asking is a straight man gay if he

287
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:28,830
only sleeps with men like yeah pretty

288
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:31,050
much see this is a philosophy at its

289
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:32,790
worst pointless speculative fiction and

290
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:34,290
it's a distraction from what we're

291
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:36,570
really talking about which is you

292
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:38,250
getting rid of those combat boots I

293
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:40,529
thought we were talking about philosophy

294
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:42,600
no we're talking about shoes why don't

295
00:11:40,529 --> 00:11:44,490
to justify what I wear to you you're

296
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:46,139
apparently fine wearing designer dresses

297
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:51,300
around your communist friends

298
00:11:46,139 --> 00:11:52,980
the left will abide a regal queer look

299
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:54,449
your performance theory doesn't explain

300
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:56,249
why trans people exists in the first

301
00:11:54,449 --> 00:11:58,410
place if gender is just a bunch of

302
00:11:56,249 --> 00:11:59,999
learned behaviors then why did we reject

303
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:01,589
our male upbringing and decide to live

304
00:11:59,999 --> 00:12:03,870
as women what matters is that we

305
00:12:01,589 --> 00:12:05,850
identify as women we can express that

306
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:08,339
identity in different ways but it's the

307
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:10,199
identity not the performance that makes

308
00:12:08,339 --> 00:12:11,939
us women but you can't be a woman

309
00:12:10,199 --> 00:12:13,829
without performing womanhood

310
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:16,170
without action and without social

311
00:12:13,829 --> 00:12:17,850
recognition the identity is meaningless

312
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:20,069
if womanhood is nothing to you but a

313
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:21,660
private daydream then you may as well do

314
00:12:20,069 --> 00:12:23,309
what those [ __ ] say and identify as

315
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:25,379
a helicopter because unless you're

316
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:27,240
living womanhood the identity is

317
00:12:25,379 --> 00:12:29,339
literally that meaningless that's very

318
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:31,199
unfair to pre-transition trans people

319
00:12:29,339 --> 00:12:32,339
well this isn't a tumblr cuddle party

320
00:12:31,199 --> 00:12:33,990
girl I'm trying to talk about what's

321
00:12:32,339 --> 00:12:35,959
really true I didn't say it was

322
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:37,949
insensitive I said it was unfair

323
00:12:35,959 --> 00:12:40,499
identifying as a woman before you

324
00:12:37,949 --> 00:12:42,809
transition is a psychological reality

325
00:12:40,499 --> 00:12:44,939
that implies a potential to live your

326
00:12:42,809 --> 00:12:46,800
inner truth no one has ever sincerely

327
00:12:44,939 --> 00:12:49,500
identified as a helicopter it's just a

328
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:51,480
troll example true but even if they were

329
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:53,519
sincere there would still be no reality

330
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:56,129
to it because helicopter is not an

331
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:58,949
actual social role whereas you can

332
00:12:56,129 --> 00:13:00,540
become a teacher a doctor or a woman but

333
00:12:58,949 --> 00:13:02,970
you have to work to get there and

334
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:05,250
ultimately society has to let you what

335
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:07,769
do you mean I can identify as a doctor

336
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:10,019
and go around handing out diagnoses but

337
00:13:07,769 --> 00:13:12,480
if no one recognizes me as a doctor then

338
00:13:10,019 --> 00:13:13,709
I'm not really practicing medicine am I

339
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,569
but that analogy means that our

340
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:17,819
womanhood can be revoked at any moment

341
00:13:15,569 --> 00:13:19,829
all it takes is being misgendered it's

342
00:13:17,819 --> 00:13:21,870
scary but isn't that the situation we're

343
00:13:19,829 --> 00:13:24,660
in why did you get so angry when the

344
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:26,699
turf called you sir isn't it because in

345
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:29,100
that situation she robbed you of your

346
00:13:26,699 --> 00:13:31,529
womanhood that's ridiculous I am a woman

347
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:33,449
that's my reality it doesn't depend on

348
00:13:31,529 --> 00:13:35,370
other people's opinions I know you're a

349
00:13:33,449 --> 00:13:37,290
woman I'm just saying that in that one

350
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:39,749
moment you effectively hide your gender

351
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:42,480
canceled another way of looking at it is

352
00:13:39,749 --> 00:13:44,249
gender is aesthetic not rational

353
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,230
either you're perceived as a woman or

354
00:13:44,249 --> 00:13:47,999
you aren't there's no reasoning your way

355
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:50,579
into it oh don't worry about that

356
00:13:47,999 --> 00:13:53,290
I don't argue I'm a woman I smashed I

357
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:55,930
know you do and it's a bad look

358
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:56,889
is this about the shoes again yep here

359
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:59,440
put these on

360
00:13:56,889 --> 00:14:03,100
absolutely not I'm not wearing those yes

361
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:06,750
you are [ __ ] no you put this on and

362
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:08,790
I'll scratch you behind the ears later

363
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:32,199
okay fine

364
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:32,829
now walk that was the worst thing I've

365
00:14:32,199 --> 00:14:34,899
ever seen

366
00:14:32,829 --> 00:14:37,120
well you're the one who made me do it

367
00:14:34,899 --> 00:14:39,459
look don't stop around like that keep

368
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:41,170
your shoulders back and steady all the

369
00:14:39,459 --> 00:14:42,490
movement comes from your hips and you

370
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:46,529
want to put the weight on the balls of

371
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:46,529
your feet here I'll show you

[Music]

373
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:17,970
your turn

374
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:32,409
do it right the category is cat girls

375
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:32,409
[Music]

376
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:37,980
yes [ __ ] that was flawless

377
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:39,990
it was iconic I'm living for this I'm

378
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:41,670
loving this for you you're doing so good

379
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:45,660
for yourself I'm never doing that again

380
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:47,130
ah why not because it's not who I am all

381
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:47,910
your advice is just trying to turn me

382
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:49,440
into you

383
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:51,660
well that's not what aesthetics is

384
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:54,060
aesthetics is the expression of an inner

385
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:56,220
truth it'll only ever be a second-rate

386
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:58,290
Justine but I can be a first-rate tabby

387
00:15:56,220 --> 00:16:00,209
well kids this week we learned a

388
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:02,760
valuable lesson about the importance of

389
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:05,730
being yourself shut up look I know I'm

390
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:07,019
not cool okay I know I'm not pretty and

391
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:09,120
I know you think you're too good for me

392
00:16:07,019 --> 00:16:10,649
because you mostly pass and I know you

393
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,890
and your friends laugh at me behind my

394
00:16:10,649 --> 00:16:12,720
back

395
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:14,760
people stare at me because I'm a

396
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,740
transgender furry and that's weird but

397
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:18,660
I'm a [ __ ] queer icon because I'm not

398
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:20,519
like you because I'm not like anyone but

399
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:22,320
myself and because I'm willing to stand

400
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:23,850
up to the people who oppress us and I'm

401
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,950
willing to stand up for the girls with

402
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:27,750
beard shadow and deep voices the girls

403
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:29,760
even other trans women make fun of and

404
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:31,890
when in the history of the world has

405
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:34,800
anyone but me ever stood up for them

406
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:36,180
that's why everyone knows who toby is it

407
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,790
was the last time anyone talked about

408
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:40,040
Justine

409
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:41,870
while tabby I didn't know you had that

410
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:44,360
in you but so what

411
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:46,160
so male to anime Twitter stands you big

412
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:49,400
deal you're mad aren't you

413
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:50,840
I'll get over in a few weeks look you're

414
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:52,250
right you have to be yourself

415
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:56,150
trying to be someone else is always a

416
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:58,010
bad look so I guess if combat boots are

417
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:59,810
your aesthetic then wear them well and

418
00:16:58,010 --> 00:17:02,330
make it work but sometimes being

419
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:05,000
yourself is not enough sometimes you

420
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:07,280
have to become yourself and for you I

421
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,150
think that means that the Smashing has

422
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,860
got to stop

423
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:11,630
I mean with the Nazis it's one thing but

424
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:13,640
you cannot be menacing radical feminists

425
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:15,260
with a bat I wouldn't have to smash if

426
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:17,390
literally anyone else we're willing to

427
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:19,310
stick up for us your delicate notion of

428
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:21,200
femininity is a product of the privilege

429
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:23,960
you share with a lot of thin white sis

430
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:25,760
feminists wow it must be so hard for you

431
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:27,260
out on the streets as a fat woman of

432
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:29,270
color shut up

433
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:31,160
I'm just saying don't claim a struggle

434
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:32,870
that isn't yours girl you could have

435
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:34,100
what I have you just have to work for it

436
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:36,380
instead of killing this heart on the

437
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:38,270
tragic victim you are raised a white boy

438
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:40,790
you've got to go to college and learn

439
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:42,470
all that philosophy yeah it's hard being

440
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:44,450
a trans woman of any background but you

441
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:46,040
still stand on a lot of privilege I look

442
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:47,660
at all the photos of trans women who are

443
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:49,760
murdered in this country and they don't

444
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:51,920
look like you or me why don't you use

445
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:53,030
your privilege and use your education to

446
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:55,070
actually do some good in the world

447
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:56,840
instead of this elective revolutionary

448
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:58,640
LARPing you make me sound like the

449
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:00,680
self-indulgent one I'm sorry I'm not

450
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:02,720
hardworking enough to go to brunch dates

451
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:05,150
and cocktail parties with trans phones

452
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:07,370
I've seen Minds change and hearts soften

453
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:09,410
before my eyes you don't win friends and

454
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:11,390
allies with a bat they're just using you

455
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:13,130
well who do you think benefits and who

456
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:14,810
do you think it's hurt when you go out

457
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:16,790
into the world and represent transport

458
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:18,440
is masculine and violent who do you

459
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:20,600
think benefits when they trot you out to

460
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:23,150
be feminine and meek and acquiescence I

461
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:24,400
guess we can't win can we you want to

462
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:29,420
just chill out and watch youtube videos

463
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:30,800
yeah okay forget about the disrespect

464
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:32,870
facts don't care about your feelings it

465
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:35,120
turns out that every chromosome every

466
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:37,100
cell in Caitlyn Jenner's body is male

467
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,720
with the exception of some of his sperm

468
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:39,230
cells you don't know what you're talking

469
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,820
about

470
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:42,820
you're not educated on genetics

471
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:48,590
you cut that out now or you'll go home

472
00:18:46,039 --> 00:18:51,850
in the ambulance yeah that seems mildly

473
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:51,850
inappropriate for a political discussion

474
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:58,639
so look at that and I feel like on my

475
00:18:56,750 --> 00:19:00,320
end it's like I'm always I feel like I'm

476
00:18:58,639 --> 00:19:01,399
always a damage controlling for the

477
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:03,320
trans community which is so frustrating

478
00:19:01,399 --> 00:19:05,179
you'll go home in an ambulance

479
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:08,539
damage control it so frustrated you'll

480
00:19:05,179 --> 00:19:10,480
go home and so frustrated you'll go home

481
00:19:08,539 --> 00:19:12,649
it's imperative that we actually use

482
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:14,419
terms that refer to something if you

483
00:19:12,649 --> 00:19:16,129
want to talk about gender as distinct

484
00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:18,649
from sex and then talk about you're a

485
00:19:16,129 --> 00:19:20,330
very feminine biological man you know a

486
00:19:18,649 --> 00:19:22,460
new paddle surgeries to prove it

487
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:24,169
happened then I think that we can talk

488
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:29,419
about what is the appropriate pronoun to

489
00:19:24,169 --> 00:19:31,700
use my problem is the the tabie I don't

490
00:19:29,419 --> 00:19:33,259
want to fight with you we're surviving

491
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:36,409
in this [ __ ] world to go there and

492
00:19:33,259 --> 00:19:38,059
you'll always be my sister well I'm glad

493
00:19:36,409 --> 00:19:42,049
I love you

494
00:19:38,059 --> 00:19:44,299
white long I was in love once I was in a

495
00:19:42,049 --> 00:19:47,929
smoky Roadhouse oh it said Cincinnati

496
00:19:44,299 --> 00:19:51,110
bent over a pool table the year was 1985

497
00:19:47,929 --> 00:19:53,360
and to this day and the perfume of cheap

498
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:56,330
whiskey hits my nostrils at just the

499
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:58,610
right moment I can almost feel the beer

500
00:19:56,330 --> 00:20:01,610
stained billiard cloth against my cheek

501
00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:04,059
oh let's watch it all on VHS cassette to

502
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:04,059
learn more
