house he's an animator and and we in his

24
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:37,519
directions took us across the Ponte Arts

25
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:41,280
Bridge which is that beautiful walking

26
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:45,560
bridge right there and on his directions

27
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:47,280

28
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:50,799
across halfway

29
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:53,680
stop kiss and continue walking that was

30
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:56,159
in his directions and we thought oh this

31
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,079

32
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:01,280

called digdug and I would play and my

41
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:52,639
arm would get so tense it was a joystick

42
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:54,560
kind right and my arm would get so tense

43
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:58,280
I I actually kind of got sort of

44
00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:01,400
