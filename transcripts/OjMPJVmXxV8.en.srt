[Music]

2
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:14,420
okay let's get started

3
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:19,850
[Music]

4
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:27,529
it's looking a man I need a man huh I

5
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:31,130
apply errs the lesbian solution oh okay

6
00:00:27,529 --> 00:00:37,859
let's get started

7
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:41,249
[Music]

8
00:00:37,859 --> 00:00:43,019
I love my king this is not really the

9
00:00:41,249 --> 00:00:46,679
most feminine moment for me not really

10
00:00:43,019 --> 00:00:50,760
my 2020 vibe but it does proportion eyes

11
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:53,100
my giant man hands right no one thinks

12
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:55,379
I'm cute let's get started okay look

13
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:57,899
this video is about canceling also known

14
00:00:55,379 --> 00:01:00,269
as cancel culture formerly known as

15
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:02,399
called out culture and I knew kids know

16
00:01:00,269 --> 00:01:05,280
all about this but before we dive in I

17
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:08,189
have to explain the basics to my fellow

18
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,500
boomers so listen up oldies in the lingo

19
00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:12,770
of these young half ekkada guzzling

20
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:16,380
smartphone addicts who killed appellees

21
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:18,929
canceling is online shaming vilified and

22
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:20,819
ostracizing but prominent members of a

23
00:01:18,929 --> 00:01:22,920
community by other members of that

24
00:01:20,819 --> 00:01:25,380
community like so much internet slang

25
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:28,049
this use of the word canceling started

26
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:29,970
out on black twitter where a few years

27
00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:32,310
ago people well

28
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:34,049
mostly women would tweet canceled or

29
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:36,149
kelly and things like that you know it

30
00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:38,069
started out as a vigilante strategy for

31
00:01:36,149 --> 00:01:40,439
bringing justice and accountability to

32
00:01:38,069 --> 00:01:42,390
powerful people who previously had been

33
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:42,989
immune to any consequences for their

34
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:45,390
actions

35
00:01:42,989 --> 00:01:47,789
for example the me2 movement promised to

36
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:49,830
use social media shaming to topple

37
00:01:47,789 --> 00:01:51,479
sexually abusive men in power who

38
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:53,729
couldn't be held accountable any other

39
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:55,319
way the promise of canceling was that it

40
00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:57,720
was going to give power back to people

41
00:01:55,319 --> 00:02:00,360
who had none and bring justice to

42
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:02,489
prominent abusers it's in a way the 21st

43
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:04,739
century version of the iya teen the

44
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:07,170
bringer of Justice the people's Avenger

45
00:02:04,739 --> 00:02:08,819
but also like the guillotine it can

46
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:10,860
become a sadistic entertainment

47
00:02:08,819 --> 00:02:14,849
spectacle and I want to make the case

48
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:16,500
that we do have well a teensy bit of a

49
00:02:14,849 --> 00:02:18,239
reign of terror situation on our hands

50
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:20,310
Gorge now there's a version of this

51
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:21,989
conversation that's already been had to

52
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:23,700
death and it goes like this on the one

53
00:02:21,989 --> 00:02:25,830
side are a bunch of male comedians who

54
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:27,870
constantly [ __ ] about how canceled

55
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:29,220
culture is out of control you can't joke

56
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:31,230
about anything anymore without these

57
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:32,790
millennial jackals trying to get you in

58
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:34,950
trouble and the other side is mostly

59
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:36,269
progressive think piece authors who

60
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:38,640
argue that there's no such thing as

61
00:02:36,269 --> 00:02:39,840
canceled culture it's just that powerful

62
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,580
people are finally being held

63
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,959
accountable for their actions and they

64
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:44,400
can't [ __ ] handle it so they go

65
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,470
around bitching about canceled culture

66
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:49,080
now unfortunately neither those

67
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:50,220
viewpoints is quite as correct as some

68
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,840
people might hope

69
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:53,730
so it's a good thing I'm here to deliver

70
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,630
through the truth you didn't know I was

71
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:56,910
transgender

72
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:58,530
story time emotional not clickbait let's

73
00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:01,140
start with an example the most high

74
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:03,030
profile YouTube canceling of 2019 was

75
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:05,610
the canceling of James Charles and again

76
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:07,710
I know you kids remember this but I have

77
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:10,560
to reheat ancient YouTube tea for the

78
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:12,840
elders put the kettle on Karen so James

79
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:16,590
Charles is a twenty year old beauty guru

80
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:18,920
which means them boomers look there's

81
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:22,410
these people who make youtube videos

82
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:24,090
teaching you how to do makeup it's worth

83
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:25,860
checking out if you can figure out how

84
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:27,959
to start up internet explorer I

85
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:30,990
certainly can't it's pretty bomb it's

86
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:33,690
lit it's uh it's groovy it's fab it's

87
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:35,940
far out man it's a gas I fully ticket

88
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:36,750
free love give peace a chance Nixon's a

89
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:38,370
fascist

90
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:42,090
so back in May of this year James's

91
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:44,850
colleague and mother figure fellow

92
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:47,940
YouTube beauty guru Tati Westbrook

93
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:50,820
uploaded a 40 minute video accusing

94
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:54,660
James of endorsing a different brand of

95
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:57,239
hair vitamins van the brand thought she

96
00:03:54,660 --> 00:04:00,060
lee that was a competitor of her brand

97
00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:02,160
of hair vitamins an enthralling plotline

98
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:04,110
I know and this was huge this was

99
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:05,870
covered in the New York Times and while

100
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:09,239
taki was added oh it doesn't

101
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:13,040
afterthought to the hair vitamin dispute

102
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:14,640
she also accused James of being a

103
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,470
predator

104
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:20,070
now I actually went back and checked

105
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:22,049
toddies original deleted video and she

106
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:24,270
actually never uses the phrase sexual

107
00:04:22,049 --> 00:04:26,100
predator it's funny I remember her

108
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:28,290
calling him that because that became the

109
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:31,590
story on Twitter but what she actually

110
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:34,020
said was James had to try to trick

111
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:36,720
straight men into thinking they're gay

112
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:38,400
oh my god you tried to trick a straight

113
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,690
man into thinking he's gay

114
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,820
yet again which is

115
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:44,170
pretty different from calling him a

116
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:45,850
sexual predator

117
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:48,700
but see this is what cancel culture does

118
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:51,430
it takes one story and transforms it

119
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:53,080
into a significantly different story

120
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:55,000
you know the headline I would write

121
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:57,580
about the James and Tati story might

122
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,460
read Tati Westbrook accuses James

123
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:03,190
Charles of trying to trick straight men

124
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:05,170
into thinking they're gay but canceled

125
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:08,890
culture transforms that story into the

126
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:12,040
headline James Charles is a sexual

127
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:13,990
predator interesting now I wanna make it

128
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:16,450
clear that my intention here is really

129
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:18,850
not to defend James Charles I'm not a

130
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:21,400
Jameis Charles Stan I have a biological

131
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:24,490
female in my 30s close to death I know

132
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:26,740
please leave a comment before I die that

133
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:29,350
said I do think this statement

134
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:31,150
James Charles is a sexual predator is a

135
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:33,070
stretch to say the least

136
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:35,470
at least based on the information I have

137
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:37,120
in December 2019 so let's analyze how

138
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:39,340
this kind of truth stretching happens

139
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,930
cancel culture trope one and you should

140
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:42,580
be writing this down a class because

141
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:44,830
this will be on the test

142
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:46,540
cancel culture trope one presumption of

143
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:48,910
guilt there's a traditional

144
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:51,280
understanding of justice according to

145
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:53,530
which before you condemn or punish a

146
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:56,230
person you hear the accusers side of the

147
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:58,000
story and the accused side of the story

148
00:05:56,230 --> 00:06:00,970
you allow both sides to present evidence

149
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,100
and only after everyone involved has had

150
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:05,500
a chance to make their case do you pass

151
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:07,750
sentence and to punish the convict Oh

152
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:09,970
won't punish me King dragging this is

153
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:13,419
punishment enough of my own Council dad

154
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:15,040
please now in the United States of we

155
00:06:13,419 --> 00:06:17,470
legally have the presumption of

156
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:19,990
innocence but canceling does not abide

157
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:22,480
by the law canceling is a form of

158
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:25,480
vigilante mob justice and a lot of times

159
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:27,700
an accusation is proof enough now that's

160
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:31,000
basically the point of the progressive

161
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:32,680
slogan believe victims it's a norm that

162
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,280
was put into place and progressive

163
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,500
spaces

164
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:38,170
because out in the world at large people

165
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:39,910
generally don't believe victims but I

166
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:42,610
think it's pretty obvious how believe

167
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:45,820
victims is a norm that's easy to abuse

168
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:49,090
was taught eerily James's victim no

169
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:51,520
she's not some powerless woman abused by

170
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:53,350
a prominent man in her industry she's on

171
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:56,200
top of the industry and she wasn't

172
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:58,660
victimized by James at all I see this

173
00:06:56,200 --> 00:07:00,910
case more as she weaponized canceled

174
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:02,620
culture against a business rival enemy

175
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:04,960
before James had even had a chance to

176
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:07,330
respond to Tottie's accusation the story

177
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:09,850
had already gone from Totti Westbrook

178
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:12,970
accuses James Charles of trying to trick

179
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:15,160
straight men to James Charles tried to

180
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:17,890
trick straight men and from there it was

181
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:20,230
generalized into James Charles is toxic

182
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:23,260
and manipulative which brings us to

183
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:25,900
canceled culture trope to abstraction

184
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:28,810
abstraction replaces the specific

185
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:31,090
concrete details of a claim with a more

186
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:33,580
generic statement in the transition from

187
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:35,890
Tati Westbrook accused James Charles of

188
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:38,500
trying to trick straight men to Jameis

189
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:40,510
Charles is toxic and manipulative we've

190
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:42,910
lost not only the sense of this being an

191
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:46,150
unverified accusation but we've also

192
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:48,250
lost all the specific details Jameis

193
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:50,500
Charles is toxic and manipulative is an

194
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:53,050
incredibly vague statement and may as

195
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:55,030
well be James Charles is bad but even

196
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:56,950
without the presumption of guilt if

197
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:58,900
someone tells me Jameis Charles is

198
00:07:56,950 --> 00:08:01,360
accused of toxic and manipulative

199
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:02,860
behavior I'm gonna think oh that sounds

200
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,840
pretty bad and I'm gonna start

201
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:07,120
speculating about the specifics and

202
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:09,190
whatever my imagination comes up with is

203
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,950
likely going to be worse than whatever

204
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:14,260
he's actually accused of also the

205
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:16,240
specific accusation that he tried to

206
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:19,300
trick straight men into thinking they're

207
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:21,370
gay is self-evidently kind of

208
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:22,190
questionable how do you trick straight

209
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:24,220
men and to think

210
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:27,560
they're gay if you find out let me know

211
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:29,720
it's bad I'm bad I'm super bad this is

212
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:31,850
our problem that straight men usually

213
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:33,950
seemed out of at the very least it

214
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:35,360
requires further explanation it's the

215
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:37,039
kind of story that sounds like it has

216
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,260
more than one side so I'm immediately

217
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:41,930
gonna feel a little bit skeptical of the

218
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:44,600
accusation and I'm also gonna side I

219
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:47,570
Tatti Westbrook because this accusation

220
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:51,350
is setting off my homophobia detection

221
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:53,420
alarm don't leave the gays alone but I'm

222
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:55,160
not gonna have an opportunity to pick up

223
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:57,260
on the potential homophobia and be

224
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:59,870
skeptical of it if all I've heard about

225
00:08:57,260 --> 00:09:02,210
the situation is Jameis Charles's toxic

226
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:04,640
and manipulative and I also want to

227
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:06,620
point out a linguistic shift that's

228
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,660
happening here when the claim was James

229
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:11,090
Charles tried to trick straight men the

230
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:13,070
verbs in the sentence were try and trick

231
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:14,930
so what we're criticizing here is

232
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:18,080
James's behavior we're criticizing

233
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:18,920
things he did allegedly trying to trick

234
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,660
straight man

235
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:23,690
but once the claim morphs into James

236
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:26,930
Charles is toxic and manipulative the

237
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:28,700
verb in the sentence is is to be so

238
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:30,980
these adjectives are characteristics of

239
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:33,350
James and it's now known as actions were

240
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:35,930
criticizing but his personality his

241
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:38,030
toxicity his manipulative Ness

242
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:41,030
this is what I'll call canceled culture

243
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:42,950
trope three essentialism essentialism is

244
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:45,230
when we go from criticizing a person's

245
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:47,180
actions to criticizing the person

246
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:49,550
themselves we're not just saying they

247
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:51,890
did bad things we're saying they're a

248
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:54,080
bad person and that's what takes us from

249
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:58,490
James charla tried to trick straight man

250
00:09:54,080 --> 00:10:01,160
to James Charles is a sexual predator so

251
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:03,500
here we're targeting James himself not

252
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:07,250
just his actions but the type of person

253
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:09,920
he is a sexual predator and we've also

254
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:11,690
really escalated the accusation because

255
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,910
I don't know about you guys but when I

256
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:16,700
hear the phrase sexual predator the

257
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:19,640
image that comes to mind is a rapist or

258
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:22,010
a child molester maybe an abusive boss

259
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:23,630
not a teenage twin come upon wanting to

260
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:24,960
date straight guys I mean not that a

261
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:27,060
person like that could

262
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:29,790
be a sexual predator but I really don't

263
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:32,700
think that he's a sexual predator is a

264
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:34,170
fair summary of the accusation so this

265
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:36,480
seems to me like a pretty nasty and

266
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:38,760
dishonest twisting of the story and it

267
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,950
happened instantaneously on Twitter it

268
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:43,290
totally dominated the conversation in a

269
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:45,000
community of millions of people for

270
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:46,830
weeks in a few days

271
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,839
James had lost millions of subscribers

272
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:51,000
and who knows what effect it had on his

273
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:53,700
personal life not that anyone seems to

274
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,560
care in fact most people seems to be

275
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:57,630
enjoying his downfall

276
00:10:55,560 --> 00:11:00,810
he was a teenage millionaire a young

277
00:10:57,630 --> 00:11:03,330
beautiful superstar easy to envy easy to

278
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:05,160
resent hard to relate to hard to

279
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:07,230
sympathize with what was the point of

280
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:08,970
canceling James Charles did we want to

281
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:11,130
teach him a lesson did we want him to

282
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:11,970
learn from his mistakes and grow as a

283
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:13,860
person

284
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:15,810
imagine imagine acting wadding someone

285
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:18,330
to learn I can imagine actually caring

286
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:20,970
my hunch is that the average Beauty

287
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:23,279
viewer was not sincerely outraged and

288
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:25,440
hurt by their sincere belief that James

289
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:27,180
Charles was a sexual predator in other

290
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,400
words this was not a case of triggered

291
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:32,070
sjw's this was a controversy

292
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:34,230
manufactured from the top by a handful

293
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:36,240
of seemingly vindictive and envious

294
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:38,540
people I honestly think that most of the

295
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:40,800
James Charles is a sexual predator crowd

296
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:43,860
just wanted to bring him down a peg

297
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:46,230
cancel culture trope for pseudo moralism

298
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:48,720
or pseudo intellectualism if you look at

299
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:50,640
the world we live in would you say that

300
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:53,339
people are usually motivated by a sense

301
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:57,300
of moral integrity and intellectual

302
00:11:53,339 --> 00:11:59,850
rigor no maybe not let's be real America

303
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:02,610
we are a bunch of morally impotent

304
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:05,640
meatbags constantly [ __ ] ourselves

305
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:08,760
out of fear and lust for tachi calling

306
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:11,160
out James this was really it was about

307
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:13,650
the hair of vitamins right I think this

308
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:16,170
was super salty that this millionaire

309
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:18,630
kid who she had supported and helped had

310
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:20,820
betrayed her by endorsing a rival brand

311
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:23,430
and accusing him of trying to trick

312
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:25,950
straight man was just a twist of the

313
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:28,890
knife but moralism or intellectualism

314
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:31,200
provide a phony pretext for the call-out

315
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:33,060
you can pretend you just won an apology

316
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:35,130
you can pretend you're just a concerned

317
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:37,340
citizen who wants the person to improve

318
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:39,230
you can pretend you're simply offering

319
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:41,090
criticism when what you're really doing

320
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:43,970
is attacking a person's career and

321
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:45,920
reputation out of spite envy revenge I

322
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:48,830
mean it could be any motivation Twitter

323
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:51,470
feud James as an over privilege spoiled

324
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:54,170
little broth and it was fun to wipe the

325
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:54,950
smile off his smug face at least for a

326
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:57,110
few weeks

327
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:58,370
its schadenfreude awright this is kind

328
00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:00,020
of petty sadism

329
00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:02,240
maybe not the internet's proudest moment

330
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:03,380
but not the most shameful either and

331
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,150
that's not to say that everyone

332
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:07,540
canceling James Charles was insincere

333
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:10,520
but there's a world of difference

334
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:13,250
between cancelar Kelly and canceled

335
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:15,680
James Charles and I'm interested to know

336
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:17,779
how these two things came to look the

337
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:19,910
same when James was being canceled

338
00:13:17,779 --> 00:13:22,460
I remember being kind of transfixed by

339
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:25,520
the sight of his life and career falling

340
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:27,529
from the sky full tailspin black smoke

341
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:29,330
spewing out and a lot of my YouTube

342
00:13:27,529 --> 00:13:31,580
friends were like well did you see James

343
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:33,970
Charles's canceled ello ello ello lol

344
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:38,089
but I looked up at James and I said oh

345
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:40,970
god that's gonna be me someday stay

346
00:13:38,089 --> 00:13:41,510
strong sister don't let the bastards get

347
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:43,350
you down

348
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:45,570
[Music]

349
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:47,700
let's switch over to white claw these

350
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:49,470
are cute these are fun a little more of

351
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:51,210
a feminine moment for me they didn't

352
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:53,910
even have these last time I was an

353
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:56,250
alcoholic not even wearing makeup

354
00:13:53,910 --> 00:14:00,870
I don't need make-up to serve a full

355
00:13:56,250 --> 00:14:02,040
biological fantasy keep drinking people

356
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:03,810
we're gonna make it through this

357
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:05,520
together so I was doing a little Twitter

358
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:08,310
archeology when I was looking into the

359
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:10,350
James Charles cancelling and I found a

360
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:12,840
bunch of tweets referencing earlier

361
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:15,060
James Charles scandals you all forgiving

362
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:17,100
James Charles he's still a trans phone

363
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:19,110
y'all are acting like just because James

364
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:22,080
Charles has receipts he's no longer a

365
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:25,590
racist trans folk like James Charles his

366
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:28,380
racist ablest transphobic and a sexual

367
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:30,270
predator all white woman you are me to a

368
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:32,130
harsh on him and he's uncounseled so

369
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:35,340
according to Twitter James Charles is

370
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:38,880
not only a sexual predator he's also a

371
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:41,910
racist and a trans hope that sounds

372
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:43,470
pretty serious let's investigate we'll

373
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:46,890
start with the transphobia allocation

374
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:48,420
catgirls of the jury exhibit so you're

375
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:49,710
not even full gay I mean know there have

376
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,850
been girls in the past that I thought

377
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:52,500
were really really beautiful there's

378
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:54,450
also been like trans guys in the pasta

379
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:56,790
too that I would like really early into

380
00:14:54,450 --> 00:15:00,120
for a moment in time and I hope as I say

381
00:14:56,790 --> 00:15:02,310
on Twitter yikes the same itchy friendly

382
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:05,700
reminder that this isn't a good look

383
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:09,450
maybe don't be transphobic disappointing

384
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:11,700
so James did [ __ ] up here the problem is

385
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:14,340
he's suggesting that being attracted to

386
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:16,920
trans men makes him less gay which

387
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:19,290
implies that trans men aren't really men

388
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:21,480
which is at odds with the way trans men

389
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:23,010
understand themselves so this does is

390
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:25,680
our criticism no doubt no doubt

391
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:29,180
however what I see when I look at this

392
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:32,610
clip of James is not a dyed-in-the-wool

393
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:34,860
transphobic bigot I see a very young

394
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:37,530
person who's still working on

395
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:39,570
understanding his own sexuality and is

396
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:41,340
trying to figure out where his

397
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:43,290
attraction to trans men fits into that

398
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:45,480
and it seems to me that the

399
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:48,660
proportionate response to that situation

400
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:51,690
is for someone to take James aside and

401
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:53,490
explain to him look here's why what you

402
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:55,589
said is hurtful to transmit

403
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:56,970
and here are some tips on how to avoid

404
00:15:55,589 --> 00:16:00,180
saying that kind of thing in the future

405
00:15:56,970 --> 00:16:02,730
you know ignorance is not the same thing

406
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:05,250
as hatred not understanding someone is

407
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:07,649
not the same as wanting them dead of

408
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:09,720
course there are committed bigots who is

409
00:16:07,649 --> 00:16:12,450
just a waste of time to engage with but

410
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:14,430
sometimes just talking to someone with a

411
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:16,380
little patience and understanding is all

412
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:18,510
it takes but that's not what cancel

413
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:21,720
culture does oh no we have to

414
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:24,600
immediately escalate every situation to

415
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:27,300
the highest possible level of conflicts

416
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:29,130
so by abstraction we get Jameis Charles

417
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:32,160
may transfer the comments and by

418
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:35,130
essentialism we get Jameis Charles is a

419
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:36,779
trans folk we don't give him a chance to

420
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:40,170
reflect we don't give him an opportunity

421
00:16:36,779 --> 00:16:43,589
to learn we go straight to branding him

422
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:45,660
a bigot nonetheless that same week James

423
00:16:43,589 --> 00:16:47,520
posted an apology to his Ennis to story

424
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:49,830
saying regardless of whatever my

425
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:52,290
intentions were that came across as me

426
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:53,940
saying I'm not fully gay because I have

427
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:56,430
been with a trans man and that is

428
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:58,500
absolutely first of all not true like

429
00:16:56,430 --> 00:17:00,750
that doesn't make me not fully gay but

430
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:03,870
that stereotype in implication is really

431
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:06,480
really dangerous and I'm very very sorry

432
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:08,939
if you are a trans man you are a man if

433
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:11,459
you're a trans girl you are a woman you

434
00:17:08,939 --> 00:17:13,429
are valid in your identity could you ask

435
00:17:11,459 --> 00:17:15,720
for a better apology like he not only

436
00:17:13,429 --> 00:17:17,790
apologizes for what he said but he also

437
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:20,910
demonstrates a clear understanding of

438
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:22,800
why it was wrong so does that mean

439
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:26,280
people stopped calling him a trans Fobo

440
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:27,720
of course not canceled culture trope 5

441
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:30,270
no forgiveness

442
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:32,700
cancel errs will often dismiss an

443
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:35,190
apology as insincere no matter how

444
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:38,010
convincingly written or delivered and of

445
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:40,470
and insincere apology is further proof

446
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:43,380
of what a Machiavellian psychopath you

447
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:45,840
really are now sometimes a good apology

448
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:47,400
will calm things down for a while but

449
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:49,470
the next time there's a scandal

450
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:52,080
the original accusation will be raised

451
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:53,730
again as if you never apologized and

452
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:56,040
that's what happened to James during the

453
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:59,520
toffee scandal when Twitter decided he

454
00:17:56,040 --> 00:18:01,050
was a transphobic sexual predator

455
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:03,750
and let's just say nothing of this

456
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:07,560
racism I've been hearing about here the

457
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:09,270
receipts Exhibit B in February 2017 when

458
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:11,550
James was much less famous than he is

459
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:13,620
now he tweeted I can't believe we're

460
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:15,900
going to Africa today oMG what if we get

461
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:18,420
Ebola James were fine we could have

462
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:21,750
gotten it at Chipotle last year okay

463
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:23,400
well that's a little insensitive maybe

464
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:25,650
but it's not really something an

465
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:29,250
influencer should tweet and fear of

466
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:31,050
disease associated with Africa I mean I

467
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:33,990
can see how it's in the same big

468
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:36,900
conceptual area as certain racist tropes

469
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:39,480
but clearly this was intended as a joke

470
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:42,300
about his friend mistaking Ebola for

471
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:46,110
e.coli right and anyway he did apologize

472
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:47,970
saying as a white sis mail I recognize

473
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:50,550
my privilege and would never want to

474
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:52,980
take that for granted but I [ __ ] up

475
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:54,690
I feel awful for posting what I said I

476
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:56,940
understand why what I said was offensive

477
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:58,560
an ignorant and Jameis hasn't made a

478
00:18:56,940 --> 00:19:02,190
habit of making jokes like that ever

479
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:04,830
since so is this one tweet from two

480
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:07,140
years ago that he apologized for on its

481
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:09,720
own enough evidence for us to justify

482
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:11,610
labeling him a racist

483
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:14,970
well according to canceled culture

484
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:15,510
absolutely abstraction takes us from two

485
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:17,070
years ago

486
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:18,990
Jameis Charles made a joke that

487
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:21,930
referenced his fear of getting Ebola in

488
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:24,540
Africa too James Charles made a racist

489
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:28,000
joke and then essentialism takes us to

490
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:34,349
James Charles is a racist

491
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:34,349
[Music]

492
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:40,780
look I want to pause to say I really do

493
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:43,300
believe in social justice at least as

494
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:45,550
much as trash like me believes than

495
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:48,340
anything and believe me I am well aware

496
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:51,370
that jokes irony and even complaints

497
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:53,920
about canceled culture are often used by

498
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:56,200
bigots to cloak their real agenda the

499
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:58,780
Southern Poverty Law Center even cited

500
00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:01,690
my video about how far-right racists use

501
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:03,520
jokes and memes and mockery of sjw's as

502
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:06,040
a way to camouflage their hateful

503
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:08,410
beliefs and make them more palatable to

504
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:10,780
a wider audience so I'm coming at this

505
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:13,780
from a place of a genuine concern for

506
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:15,690
anti racism and anti transphobia as well

507
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:18,550
as an awareness of the fact that

508
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:20,890
canceled culture is often just a

509
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:23,080
conservative red herring used to shut

510
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:26,830
down any and all complaints about racism

511
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:28,600
or transphobia but I've also become very

512
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:30,690
disillusioned with the way these

513
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:33,370
accusations are thrown around so

514
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:35,140
frivolously on social media by the way

515
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:38,380
they're used to escalate conflict

516
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:40,179
instead of promote understanding and by

517
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:43,570
the way they're sometimes a weaponized

518
00:20:40,179 --> 00:20:45,970
to destroy people who have made mistakes

519
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:48,090
but who really don't deserve to be

520
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:50,679
destroyed now maybe you're thinking

521
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:52,990
destroyed what do you mean destroyed

522
00:20:50,679 --> 00:20:54,730
James is a 20 year old millionaire on

523
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:58,179
his way to owning his own makeup Empire

524
00:20:54,730 --> 00:21:01,090
and you are completely correct if you're

525
00:20:58,179 --> 00:21:03,429
James Charles if you're a superstar then

526
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:04,240
being cancelled most likely does not

527
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:06,220
destroy you

528
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:09,130
the cancel errs blend into the general

529
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:11,590
backdrop of haters and they can set you

530
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:14,170
back a few million subscribers and a lot

531
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:17,140
of emotional turmoil but in the long run

532
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:18,880
they can't really touch your success but

533
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:21,160
here's the thing what if you're not

534
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:23,230
James Charles what if you're a small

535
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:24,250
creator what if you can't afford to

536
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:26,200
publicly

537
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:28,450
so what if you belong to a marginalized

538
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:31,360
community and you rely on that community

539
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:33,929
for support well in that case it's a

540
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,929
whole different story

541
00:21:34,169 --> 00:21:46,950
let's Irish up this coffee shaken not

542
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,950
stirred it spilled over my [ __ ] oh

543
00:21:47,159 --> 00:21:50,049
that's good

544
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:52,480
booze and coffee is a good combination

545
00:21:50,049 --> 00:21:54,429
I'm feeling amped right now I'm feeling

546
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:56,230
a height so this is the part in the

547
00:21:54,429 --> 00:21:58,240
video where I should admit that I'm not

548
00:21:56,230 --> 00:22:01,360
just a casual observer here at the time

549
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:02,830
I'm making this video sweaty I'm super

550
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,150
Hansel you know I try to make videos

551
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:05,770
that are both informative and

552
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:07,179
entertaining so in this video the

553
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:09,340
information is you get to learn about

554
00:22:07,179 --> 00:22:11,380
canceled culture and the entertainment

555
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:13,960
is you get to watch a worm try to

556
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:15,880
wriggle off a hook let's get started

557
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:17,530
forgive me Father for I have sent a how

558
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:18,820
are you god I never wanted to be the

559
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:21,150
kind of youtuber who would resort to

560
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:23,620
making videos about my own drama but

561
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:25,240
things have gotten to a point I feel

562
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:27,940
like I cannot continue this channel

563
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:30,039
until he's built some teeth so let's get

564
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:31,720
started okay first a little backstory a

565
00:22:30,039 --> 00:22:33,070
little me is awesome I've never talked

566
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:35,200
about this on my channel before so this

567
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:37,900
is a super [ __ ] vulnerable moment for

568
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:40,150
me but I am in fact a transgender woman

569
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:43,419
which may come as a big shock to many of

570
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:44,860
you since I'm 100% real fish I get

571
00:22:43,419 --> 00:22:48,309
comments all the time from like very

572
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:50,830
solemn people like guys I'm pretty sure

573
00:22:48,309 --> 00:22:52,510
this is a dude great work detective

574
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:55,570
you're cracked the case you're doing

575
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:57,640
very good sweetie very very good

576
00:22:55,570 --> 00:23:00,429
I guess one of YouTube's leading a

577
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:02,169
b-list transgendered I have a prime

578
00:23:00,429 --> 00:23:04,750
target for cancellation and I have been

579
00:23:02,169 --> 00:23:05,710
cancelled many many times and we're

580
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:07,360
going to talk about some of the things

581
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:08,890
I've been canceled for and some of the

582
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,360
things I've been criticized for and the

583
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:12,070
difference between criticism and

584
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:13,659
cancelling because yes there is a

585
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:15,010
difference as we go along

586
00:23:13,659 --> 00:23:17,260
I will admit where I have made mistakes

587
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:20,140
because despite how I look I am NOT a

588
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:22,690
literal goddess and I will heed I will

589
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:25,630
apologize where I believe apologies are

590
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:27,789
due however where I believe that

591
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:30,309
criticism of me is excessive or

592
00:23:27,789 --> 00:23:31,960
unwarranted I will not apologize because

593
00:23:30,309 --> 00:23:33,760
here I Contra points industries we are

594
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:35,980
not in the business of serving [ __ ]

595
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:37,810
so the reason for my current

596
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:39,880
cancellation is

597
00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:42,910
in summary that in my last video

598
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:45,100
opulence I cast transsexual porn star

599
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:46,960
buck angel in the role of John Waters

600
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:49,060
and yes it's a much better story than

601
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:50,950
the hair vitamin D buckle so notify the

602
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:53,230
drama channels put in a good word for me

603
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:55,180
because sweetie I'm not here to make

604
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:56,590
friends I'm here to win so basically I'm

605
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:58,660
cancelled for collaborating with buck

606
00:23:56,590 --> 00:24:01,960
angel and a lot of trans people think

607
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:03,760
buck angel is a horrible person and so

608
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:07,330
my collaboration with buck angel is

609
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:09,790
evidence that I too am a horrible person

610
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:12,370
cancel culture trope 6 the transitive

611
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:14,560
property of cancellation cancellation is

612
00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:16,960
infectious if you associate with a

613
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:17,650
cancelled person the cancellation rubs

614
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,450
off

615
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:21,550
it's like gonorrhea except doxycycline

616
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:23,740
won't save you this time sweetie look

617
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:26,290
this whole incident hinges first of all

618
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:29,350
on whether buck angel is in fact a

619
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:32,380
horrible person so who is buck angel

620
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:34,390
well he's a trans man of my parents

621
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:35,380
generation he grew up in a world where

622
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:36,910
there was not anything like the

623
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:38,980
visibility and access to information

624
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:40,480
about transition we have today and where

625
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:42,310
there was a strict medical gatekeeping

626
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:44,500
system in place for people who wanted to

627
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:46,420
transition in fact buck was the first

628
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:48,520
female to male patient his doctor had

629
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:50,410
ever treated in the 2000s he rose to

630
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:52,300
prominence as an adult performer his

631
00:24:50,410 --> 00:24:54,550
gimmick at the time being the man with a

632
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:56,170
[ __ ] but he also became an activist he

633
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:58,060
wanted to create more positive trans

634
00:24:56,170 --> 00:24:59,410
representation within the porn world and

635
00:24:58,060 --> 00:25:01,510
from there he'd become a more general

636
00:24:59,410 --> 00:25:02,680
educator and advocate for trans people I

637
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:05,320
first heard about him in the early

638
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:07,750
2010's when I was doing some googling

639
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:09,250
about some little gender issues I was

640
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:11,170
having myself though I ended up deciding

641
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:12,970
to remain a female and buck was one of

642
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:14,800
the first female-to-male people I'd ever

643
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:16,330
heard about and he made an impact on me

644
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:18,220
in parks you take one look at him and

645
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:20,090
you think honey that's a man but he was

646
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:22,490
born a woman

647
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:24,260
I can do that so it's not that he

648
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:26,210
inspired me to transition or anything

649
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:28,220
it's just it was one of many moments

650
00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:30,050
along my whole entire gender journey so

651
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:31,790
I had positive feelings about trampa

652
00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:33,860
that's three calls himself from back

653
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:35,750
then and then a few months ago when I

654
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:37,850
was feeling angry and miserable and

655
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:39,530
despised over another time I was being

656
00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:42,050
canceled by trans Twitter we'll get to

657
00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:44,570
that one later I saw this post from buck

658
00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:47,000
on Instagram dear beautiful human being

659
00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:48,980
I see your pain it is okay that you lash

660
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,660
out at me you do this because I am you

661
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:52,970
and you are reflecting yourself hate to

662
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:54,950
me I am strong and will be here for you

663
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:56,810
forever and no matter what this is my

664
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:59,540
intention as a human being to help

665
00:25:56,810 --> 00:26:01,790
others love buck angel and the caption

666
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:03,560
suffering that is why the trans

667
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:05,540
community lashes out at each other I am

668
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:07,430
very aware of the hate towards me by

669
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:09,380
some in the community they hate on me

670
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:11,330
and others because they are hurt and

671
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:13,520
those were exactly the words I needed to

672
00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:15,440
hear at that moment so I commented a

673
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:17,840
heart and then buck to young to me and

674
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:19,910
he said I love you and I was like senpai

675
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:22,040
noticed me and so I said I love you back

676
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:24,650
then when I was working on opulence I

677
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:26,240
needed a voice actor to do a line from

678
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:28,310
John Waters book and it was my

679
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,630
co-director Theron who suggested don't

680
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:31,160
you think buck angel sounds kind of like

681
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:32,810
John Waters and I said well he just

682
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:34,520
messaged me on insta let's see if he

683
00:26:32,810 --> 00:26:37,430
wants to do it and I just loved the idea

684
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:39,950
of having [ __ ] angel as John Waters in

685
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:41,750
the video credits like a trans icon

686
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:45,590
playing a gay icon in my head it was

687
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:46,910
just so well iconic so he got in touch

688
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:49,490
with buck about the line and he was like

689
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:51,470
yeah I'd love to do it so here it is the

690
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:54,260
10-second voice-over clip that ruined a

691
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:56,600
month of my life one must remember there

692
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:59,750
is such a thing as good bad taste and

693
00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:03,500
bad bad taste to understand bad taste

694
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:04,070
one must have very good taste that's it

695
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:06,410
children

696
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:08,090
that's why mommies cancelled now I was

697
00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:10,160
aware at the time that trans Twitter

698
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:12,860
hated buck angel but my thinking was

699
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:14,660
well trans Twitter kind of hates every

700
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:17,090
trans celebrity and they certainly hate

701
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:19,130
me so I wasn't gonna let that stop me

702
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:21,680
little did I know quite how vicious

703
00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:23,330
things were about to get now so far I've

704
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:25,430
been telling this story from my point of

705
00:27:23,330 --> 00:27:27,530
view but I do want to give a fair and

706
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:29,600
balanced account so I want to pause and

707
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:31,700
contextualize boys some trans people

708
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:33,760
hate buck angels so much they're willing

709
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:35,440
to cancel anyone who even associate

710
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,850
with him basically it all goes back to

711
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:39,490
this old debate in the trans community

712
00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:42,340
known today and tumblr lingo as true

713
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:43,960
scum versus transgenders so true scum

714
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:46,660
are trans people who distinguish between

715
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:48,730
true trans people and fake trans people

716
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:50,770
who they call trenders or to cutes

717
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:52,540
usually true scum think that what it is

718
00:27:50,770 --> 00:27:54,520
to be trans is to have a lifelong

719
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:56,350
struggle with dysphoria to pursue a

720
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:58,690
medical transition involving hormones

721
00:27:56,350 --> 00:28:00,880
and surgery and to socially reassimilate

722
00:27:58,690 --> 00:28:02,530
into your target binary gender so male

723
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:04,960
or female anyone who is not that

724
00:28:02,530 --> 00:28:06,100
according to true scum must either be a

725
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,660
confused teenager

726
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:09,520
someone just trying to get attention

727
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:12,220
someone mistaking their trauma or their

728
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:14,770
fetish for being trans in a word at

729
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:16,870
render so that's a vigil transness that

730
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:18,070
usually excludes non-binary people as

731
00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:19,840
well as people who don't want to

732
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:21,340
medically transition for whatever reason

733
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:23,770
and for that reason this view is

734
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:25,540
sometimes also called trans medical ism

735
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:27,550
true scum obviously being the derogatory

736
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:29,380
term for these people so true scum are

737
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:31,600
very hated by a lot of trans people

738
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:33,430
because their viewpoint is that not all

739
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:35,800
trans identities are valid and buck

740
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:38,080
angel is widely perceived to be true

741
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:39,310
scum so the next question to ask is is

742
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:42,430
this true

743
00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:44,620
is buck angel in fact truths come now my

744
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:46,900
honest answer to that question is I

745
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:48,580
don't know he certainly said some things

746
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:50,170
that sound like things fruits come say

747
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:52,480
I'll give you that the point he likes to

748
00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:54,190
make a lot is that he's transsexual not

749
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:56,340
transgender and the difference between

750
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:58,450
those terms is sometimes defined as

751
00:28:56,340 --> 00:29:00,580
transsexual imply that you want to

752
00:28:58,450 --> 00:29:03,040
pursue medical transition so hormones

753
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:05,110
and surgery and transgender doesn't

754
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:06,940
imply that and people associate this I'm

755
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:09,160
transsexual not transgender thing with

756
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:11,050
true scum because true scum often call

757
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:12,700
themselves transsexuals and say that

758
00:29:11,050 --> 00:29:14,740
anyone who isn't a transsexual

759
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:16,480
isn't really trans and often those

760
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:18,130
people will be very mean to people they

761
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:20,860
call trenders especially certain

762
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:26,200
transmeta close youtubers like Vanessa

763
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:28,450
LeBlanc and too cute Smasher 9000 turkey

764
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:34,120
Smasher 9 doesn't roast my back cough

765
00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:36,010
and I dare you but I think it's

766
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:38,560
important to keep in mind that the term

767
00:29:36,010 --> 00:29:40,810
true scum is a product of the 2014

768
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:42,640
tumbler Wars and trying to apply it to

769
00:29:40,810 --> 00:29:45,010
trans people of an older generation can

770
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:46,660
sometimes be misleading like when buck

771
00:29:45,010 --> 00:29:47,680
angel transitioned the word transsexual

772
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:49,690
was just the

773
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:51,130
word for his identity and he still

774
00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:52,900
identifies that way so when younger

775
00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:55,090
trance he will tell him it's wrong teens

776
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:56,890
the word transsexual he feels like these

777
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:58,990
ungrateful Millennials are invalidating

778
00:29:56,890 --> 00:30:00,610
his identity and I do understand where

779
00:29:58,990 --> 00:30:02,320
he's coming from with that but I also

780
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:04,810
understand why a lot of non-binary

781
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:06,610
people are skeptical about buck like he

782
00:30:04,810 --> 00:30:08,830
says again and again I'm transsexual not

783
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:10,600
transgender like don't mix me up with

784
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:12,580
those people and that eagerness to

785
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:15,370
separate himself from transgender people

786
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:16,780
it comes across as hostility like I

787
00:30:15,370 --> 00:30:18,940
don't think he's ever actually said that

788
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:21,130
non-binary people aren't valid but I

789
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:22,780
personally don't like that he seems like

790
00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:24,610
he wants to distance himself from them

791
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:26,560
and that's my desert Grimaud with buck

792
00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:28,630
it's not that he invalidates non-binary

793
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:30,250
identities because I don't really see

794
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:32,110
him doing that and if he was doing that

795
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:33,580
I would have seen it because for the

796
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:34,750
last two months a lot of people have

797
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:36,970
been doing nothing but sending me

798
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:38,560
problematic buck angel tweets but as

799
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:40,810
someone who cares a lot about non-binary

800
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:43,330
people and who loves the non-binary

801
00:30:40,810 --> 00:30:45,910
people in my life it does upset me when

802
00:30:43,330 --> 00:30:47,440
he does this distancing thing and I hope

803
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:49,060
he listens to this criticism because I

804
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:50,620
think it would be cool if he got better

805
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:52,540
about this of course

806
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:54,070
buck is technically right that there are

807
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:55,840
different kinds of trans people and I

808
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:57,370
agree it's important that we can make

809
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:59,080
those distinctions and talk about the

810
00:30:57,370 --> 00:31:01,450
differences when they're relevant but I

811
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:03,190
also think that as a community trans

812
00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:05,050
people benefit from unity not division

813
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:06,670
like if you have an employer who

814
00:31:05,050 --> 00:31:08,230
discriminates against trans people

815
00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:10,360
they're not gonna care if you're

816
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:12,070
transsexual transgender non-binary or

817
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:13,930
gender non-conforming they're gonna

818
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:15,970
discriminate against you regardless so

819
00:31:13,930 --> 00:31:17,590
we're all in this together and there's a

820
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:19,720
lot of disagreements among us and we

821
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:21,340
often don't get along so well but

822
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:23,200
politically I think we should work

823
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:25,060
together as much as possible instead of

824
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:27,580
splitting into little factions because

825
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:29,620
we share most of the same interests and

826
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:31,030
I think the best way to do that is to

827
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:32,680
build bridges instead of burning them

828
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:34,690
and that's why I'm willing to work with

829
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:36,640
people like buck angel who I have some

830
00:31:34,690 --> 00:31:38,200
disagreements with it creates a

831
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:40,840
connection you know and having that

832
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:42,490
connection can lead to communication and

833
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:43,660
build understanding also I need all the

834
00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:45,570
connections I can get Gorge

835
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:48,720
I am very lonely

836
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:50,489
it's not a joke it's true now I get that

837
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:52,350
some people have views that are so

838
00:31:50,489 --> 00:31:54,539
harmful that giving them a platform is

839
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:56,220
potentially dangerous but in any case I

840
00:31:54,539 --> 00:31:58,350
didn't even give puck a platform to

841
00:31:56,220 --> 00:32:00,690
share his opinions I gave him a platform

842
00:31:58,350 --> 00:32:02,340
to be a John Waters impersonator a bunch

843
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:03,960
of people on my subreddit were like why

844
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:05,820
couldn't she just get John Waters to do

845
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:07,590
those lions well first of all I don't

846
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:09,179
actually know John but I just have a

847
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:12,239
feeling he would write me off as some

848
00:32:09,179 --> 00:32:14,369
kind of trap millennial sjw like why is

849
00:32:12,239 --> 00:32:16,440
buck angel cancelled but John Waters

850
00:32:14,369 --> 00:32:18,330
isn't well because trans Twitter does

851
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:19,649
not know who John Waters is and let's

852
00:32:18,330 --> 00:32:21,119
try to keep it that way I actually

853
00:32:19,649 --> 00:32:23,309
mentioned this to a friend of mine who

854
00:32:21,119 --> 00:32:25,349
knows John and he told me that he and

855
00:32:23,309 --> 00:32:28,669
John have actually watched buck angels

856
00:32:25,349 --> 00:32:31,619
porn together so plot twist

857
00:32:28,669 --> 00:32:33,929
okay so trash Twitter won't forgive me

858
00:32:31,619 --> 00:32:35,700
unless I condemn buck angel as true scum

859
00:32:33,929 --> 00:32:38,279
and apologize for ever working with him

860
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:39,599
but I'm not going to do that because I

861
00:32:38,279 --> 00:32:40,169
don't think it would be the right thing

862
00:32:39,599 --> 00:32:41,909
to do

863
00:32:40,169 --> 00:32:44,399
and doing it just to get my cellphone

864
00:32:41,909 --> 00:32:46,049
cancelled would be cowardly I'm happy to

865
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:47,789
tell you I absolutely disagree with

866
00:32:46,049 --> 00:32:50,039
Buck's divisive rhetoric about

867
00:32:47,789 --> 00:32:51,179
transsexual versus transgender I wish

868
00:32:50,039 --> 00:32:52,889
you would be an ally to the whole

869
00:32:51,179 --> 00:32:54,720
transgender umbrella instead of trying

870
00:32:52,889 --> 00:32:56,279
to distance himself from the rest and

871
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,899
I'm happy to hear at the perspective of

872
00:32:56,279 --> 00:32:59,340
non-binary people who don't trust him

873
00:32:57,899 --> 00:33:01,349
because I totally get where they're

874
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:04,049
coming from and I think that's valid but

875
00:33:01,349 --> 00:33:06,059
I also respect the decades if good

876
00:33:04,049 --> 00:33:08,489
activism buck angel has done for trans

877
00:33:06,059 --> 00:33:10,559
people and I am grateful to him for that

878
00:33:08,489 --> 00:33:12,269
and in light of that I'm willing to give

879
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:14,549
him the benefit of the doubt about where

880
00:33:12,269 --> 00:33:16,710
his heart is and express my criticism in

881
00:33:14,549 --> 00:33:18,779
a more measured way than just attacking

882
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:21,090
who he is as a person but Twitter

883
00:33:18,779 --> 00:33:23,340
needs to establish that he's a horrible

884
00:33:21,090 --> 00:33:26,220
person because this is the strategy

885
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:28,259
they've chosen to establish that I am a

886
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:29,789
horrible person and if the true scum

887
00:33:28,259 --> 00:33:31,649
allegation isn't strong enough to prove

888
00:33:29,789 --> 00:33:33,419
it oh they have other pieces of evidence

889
00:33:31,649 --> 00:33:36,090
to fall back on to hold up their

890
00:33:33,419 --> 00:33:39,059
conclusion for example here's a tweet

891
00:33:36,090 --> 00:33:40,499
claiming Natalie's trying so [ __ ]

892
00:33:39,059 --> 00:33:42,090
hard to make it sound like the only

893
00:33:40,499 --> 00:33:44,279
thing buck angel ever did was write a

894
00:33:42,090 --> 00:33:47,070
few if he tweets and that's just so

895
00:33:44,279 --> 00:33:48,960
[ __ ] far from the truth dude launched

896
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:50,999
a targeted tabloid harassment campaign

897
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:53,369
outing a trans woman against her will

898
00:33:50,999 --> 00:33:55,289
with a specific intent of causing her

899
00:33:53,369 --> 00:33:57,149
physical emotional and professional harm

900
00:33:55,289 --> 00:33:58,980
the shorter way of saying that is that

901
00:33:57,149 --> 00:33:59,730
he wanted to make her suffer and she

902
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:02,730
very well

903
00:33:59,730 --> 00:34:05,070
could have been killed yikes this a nip

904
00:34:02,730 --> 00:34:07,830
chief friendly reminder that this isn't

905
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:09,600
a good look maybe don't try to get trans

906
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:11,450
women killed disappointing

907
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:13,710
it sounds pretty serious let's

908
00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:16,500
investigate here's what I've managed to

00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:19,110

00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:38,790
successful director of the matrix at the

918
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:41,370
time not yet out as a transgender woman

919
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:44,040
the synopsis is that Ilsa Strix and buck

920
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:45,990
angels marriage ended after he also had

921
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:47,880
an affair with lana wachowski who was

922
00:34:45,990 --> 00:34:49,560
not yet out his trans so buck was

923
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:51,510
understandably upset about the affair

924
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:53,820
and in what seems like a petty act of

925
00:34:51,510 --> 00:34:56,310
revenge told a series of magazines that

926
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:58,590
this celebrity director wachowski was a

927
00:34:56,310 --> 00:35:01,230
crossdresser who had stolen his wife

928
00:34:58,590 --> 00:35:04,680
which I guess was the information he had

929
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:05,610
at the time so is that outing a trans

930
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:07,530
woman against her will

931
00:35:05,610 --> 00:35:09,060
well in retrospect it seems like it

932
00:35:07,530 --> 00:35:11,100
though that may not be what he thought

933
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:12,900
he was doing at the time but to really

934
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:14,730
get to the bottom of this we have to do

935
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:16,440
some digging we have to troll through

936
00:35:14,730 --> 00:35:18,660
the dirty details of trans people's

937
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:19,560
personal histories which I've noticed is

938
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:22,470
one of the Internet's favorite

939
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:25,230
activities so I actually went on eBay

940
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:28,500
and I purchased Rolling Stone issue 9 91

941
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:34,340
January 2006 and I'm finally able to

942
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:35,550
reveal the seller canceled the order god

943
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:38,100
dammit

944
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:40,050
but I was finally able to track down and

945
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:41,640
translate a Spanish version of The

946
00:35:40,050 --> 00:35:43,920
Rolling Stone article from the wayback

947
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:45,120
machine and I'm finally able to expose

948
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:49,230
the truth

949
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:51,300
stop freeze exactly where you are take a

950
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:52,950
look at yourself and what all of us have

951
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:55,080
been doing for the last thirty Seconds

952
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:57,300
who does this behavior remind you of if

953
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:59,610
your answer is social justice advocates

954
00:35:57,300 --> 00:36:01,860
fighting for trans equality you are

955
00:35:59,610 --> 00:36:04,589
incorrect if your answer is creepy

956
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:07,979
stalkers who hate trans people

957
00:36:04,589 --> 00:36:10,259
I am very suspicious of anyone who's

958
00:36:07,979 --> 00:36:12,150
online behavior prompts me to dig

959
00:36:10,259 --> 00:36:14,009
through articles full of dead names and

960
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:16,410
sort of scandals involving trans people

961
00:36:14,009 --> 00:36:18,839
from almost two decades ago this is very

962
00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:21,180
similar to techniques used against trans

963
00:36:18,839 --> 00:36:23,009
people by internet fascists so I'm

964
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:25,109
pretty suspicious of anyone pushing this

965
00:36:23,009 --> 00:36:26,849
kind of investigation how can you tell

966
00:36:25,109 --> 00:36:29,219
the difference between a trans and our

967
00:36:26,849 --> 00:36:31,529
Co socialists with an anime avatar and a

968
00:36:29,219 --> 00:36:33,150
Nazi pretending to be a trans anti-flu

969
00:36:31,529 --> 00:36:36,689
socialist with an anime avatar

970
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:38,969
well you can't anonymous is anonymous is

971
00:36:36,689 --> 00:36:41,729
anonymous whether it's on 4chan or

972
00:36:38,969 --> 00:36:43,499
twitter so unless buck angel Ilsa Strix

973
00:36:41,729 --> 00:36:45,089
or lana wachowski gets in touch with me

974
00:36:43,499 --> 00:36:47,459
and lets me know that for some

975
00:36:45,089 --> 00:36:49,650
unimaginable reason they want me to

976
00:36:47,459 --> 00:36:52,439
publicly dig up their 17-year old

977
00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:53,279
divorce drama this is none of my [ __ ]

978
00:36:52,439 --> 00:36:55,709
business

979
00:36:53,279 --> 00:36:57,779
and it's none of yours either so shut up

980
00:36:55,709 --> 00:36:59,740
and go back to Keeley farms where you

981
00:36:57,779 --> 00:37:04,150
belong

982
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:11,140
[Music]

983
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:14,880
let's Irish up this tea doesn't work as

984
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:17,260
well with tea so setting aside any

985
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:20,620
tabloid drama that may have happened

986
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:23,440
during the Bush administration I'm

987
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:24,400
saying this is a contest way and they

988
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:28,060
deserve it

989
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:30,370
they [ __ ] deserve the hunting us I'm

990
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:33,220
spilling whiskey tea all over my goddamn

991
00:37:30,370 --> 00:37:35,980
bathrobe I'm a lady she's a woman

992
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:38,140
the main argument against me usually

993
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:40,360
references a collage of Bukka angels

994
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:42,250
problematic tweets and this is supposed

995
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:45,490
to be definitive evidence that he is a

996
00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:47,380
horrible person and therefore that I am

997
00:37:45,490 --> 00:37:49,870
a horrible person for collaborating with

998
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:52,840
him well here's the thing though a

999
00:37:49,870 --> 00:37:55,210
collage of problematic tweets does not

1000
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:57,340
define a person and I'm very used to

1001
00:37:55,210 --> 00:37:59,740
being defined that way myself so I know

1002
00:37:57,340 --> 00:38:01,930
how unfair I can be before I ever

1003
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:03,430
collaborated with buck angel a lot of

1004
00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:04,390
people on Twitter were already calling

1005
00:38:03,430 --> 00:38:06,070
me true scum

1006
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:08,200
that's been going on a year and a half

1007
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:09,760
now and any time my name comes up on

1008
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:11,080
Twitter a bunch of people respond to

1009
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:13,090
saying Natalie as true scum

1010
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:15,130
Natalie's a trans medical Estate's

1011
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:16,810
non-binary people and you should really

1012
00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:18,400
think what kind of message you're

1013
00:38:16,810 --> 00:38:21,010
sending to your trans and non-binary

1014
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:23,260
followers by platforming her and if the

1015
00:38:21,010 --> 00:38:25,630
person defends me or argues back in any

1016
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:27,940
way they say I can't believe you're

1017
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:29,680
ignoring the valid concerns of

1018
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:32,170
marginalized people you know they're

1019
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:34,450
weaponizing their marginalised status as

1020
00:38:32,170 --> 00:38:37,180
trans people to isolate and attack

1021
00:38:34,450 --> 00:38:39,190
another trans person and sometimes this

1022
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:44,410
stuff gets to my head too I start asking

1023
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:48,310
myself wait am i a trans medical estate

1024
00:38:44,410 --> 00:38:50,890
but the answer is no I just don't these

1025
00:38:48,310 --> 00:38:53,470
things they're saying about me are 100%

1026
00:38:50,890 --> 00:38:55,660
not true you know believe marginalized

1027
00:38:53,470 --> 00:38:58,420
people is a norm that has encouraged and

1028
00:38:55,660 --> 00:39:00,610
leftist spaces for good reason much like

1029
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:02,470
believe victims or believe women and

1030
00:39:00,610 --> 00:39:04,600
these norms were established to

1031
00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:07,000
counterbalance the mainstream tendency

1032
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:09,790
which is not to listen to marginalize

1033
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:12,340
people or to victims or to women but any

1034
00:39:09,790 --> 00:39:15,250
norm can be abused and the blunt fact of

1035
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:16,569
the matter is sometimes marginalized

1036
00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:18,279
people are wrong

1037
00:39:16,569 --> 00:39:21,189
sometimes people calling themselves

1038
00:39:18,279 --> 00:39:24,189
victims are obscuring a more complicated

1039
00:39:21,189 --> 00:39:27,519
situation and it's even happened once or

1040
00:39:24,189 --> 00:39:30,549
twice that a woman has lied and the

1041
00:39:27,519 --> 00:39:33,910
accusation that I'm truest gun is simply

1042
00:39:30,549 --> 00:39:35,919
false I mean first of all I don't even

1043
00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:37,689
think of my own transgenderism as a

1044
00:39:35,919 --> 00:39:39,939
medical disorder much less everyone

1045
00:39:37,689 --> 00:39:42,519
else's I have of course collaborated

1046
00:39:39,939 --> 00:39:44,979
with dr. Spiegel at all but I will not

1047
00:39:42,519 --> 00:39:47,919
have my artistry reduced to mere

1048
00:39:44,979 --> 00:39:55,299
medicine second this accusation that I

1049
00:39:47,919 --> 00:39:57,069
hate non-binary people is just no no no

1050
00:39:55,299 --> 00:39:59,019
my thinking about trans identity has

1051
00:39:57,069 --> 00:40:00,699
always been informed by non-binary

1052
00:39:59,019 --> 00:40:02,589
people I used to identify it as

1053
00:40:00,699 --> 00:40:04,449
non-binary myself before I medically

1054
00:40:02,589 --> 00:40:06,160
transitioned and some of the closest

1055
00:40:04,449 --> 00:40:08,529
people to me in my life today are

1056
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:11,829
non-binary trans people some of whom are

1057
00:40:08,529 --> 00:40:13,959
also transsexuals incidentally it's

1058
00:40:11,829 --> 00:40:15,699
complicated I've also made at least five

1059
00:40:13,959 --> 00:40:17,529
videos on this channel arguing for the

1060
00:40:15,699 --> 00:40:19,809
validity of non-binary gender identities

1061
00:40:17,529 --> 00:40:21,640
going back more than three years so

1062
00:40:19,809 --> 00:40:24,159
that's five out of around fifty videos

1063
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:26,199
or ten percent of the content I've made

1064
00:40:24,159 --> 00:40:28,150
on this channel is about non-binary

1065
00:40:26,199 --> 00:40:30,279
identity a few months ago I even made a

1066
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:32,229
30-minute video called trans trenders

1067
00:40:30,279 --> 00:40:33,789
which uses character dialogue to show

1068
00:40:32,229 --> 00:40:35,650
what I think are the shortcomings of

1069
00:40:33,789 --> 00:40:37,390
trans medical ism but there's still

1070
00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:38,949
hundreds of people on Twitter saying

1071
00:40:37,390 --> 00:40:41,049
that I'm true scum who hates non-binary

1072
00:40:38,949 --> 00:40:44,169
people and their main piece of evidence

1073
00:40:41,049 --> 00:40:46,539
for that is a collage of my problematic

1074
00:40:44,169 --> 00:40:48,279
tweets so let's take a look at that

1075
00:40:46,539 --> 00:40:50,049
here's the three tweets that I usually

1076
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:52,749
see scrapbooks together as definitive

1077
00:40:50,049 --> 00:40:55,089
proof that I hate non-binary people this

1078
00:40:52,749 --> 00:40:56,619
is the first one from September 2018

1079
00:40:55,089 --> 00:40:58,089
notice how it's taken out of context

1080
00:40:56,619 --> 00:40:59,890
from the thread so you can't even see

1081
00:40:58,089 --> 00:41:01,989
what I'm talking about I'm sure this is

1082
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:03,819
not the experience of many n B's and B

1083
00:41:01,989 --> 00:41:05,679
means non-binary people I leave it to

1084
00:41:03,819 --> 00:41:08,140
them to articulate what MB existence

1085
00:41:05,679 --> 00:41:10,689
looks like in a binary world I do not

1086
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:12,759
and I cannot speak for them but surely

1087
00:41:10,689 --> 00:41:15,339
Annika got I used to write like such a

1088
00:41:12,759 --> 00:41:17,589
nerd but surely an account that begins

1089
00:41:15,339 --> 00:41:19,779
and ends with I'm not a man because I

1090
00:41:17,589 --> 00:41:22,209
don't identify as one is pretty weak

1091
00:41:19,779 --> 00:41:24,219
okay when I wrote the Twitter thread

1092
00:41:22,209 --> 00:41:27,219
that that tweet has been clipped out of

1093
00:41:24,219 --> 00:41:29,079
I was defending myself from accusations

1094
00:41:27,219 --> 00:41:29,680
that my most recent video at the time

1095
00:41:29,079 --> 00:41:32,230
the

1096
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:34,420
aesthetic was anti non-binary in that

1097
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:36,250
video does a character name to Justine

1098
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:37,839
who defends a version of the

1099
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:39,849
performativity theory of gender and

1100
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:41,440
basically I made this video to express

1101
00:41:39,849 --> 00:41:43,240
some angst I was feeling about the

1102
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:46,150
pressures of transitioning in the public

1103
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:48,280
eye this was a very one year on hormones

1104
00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:49,990
moment for me and I've already moved on

1105
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:53,050
in my thinking at that time I was very

1106
00:41:49,990 --> 00:41:54,579
um my behavior must be perfectly

1107
00:41:53,050 --> 00:41:56,980
feminine at all times or else I'm not

1108
00:41:54,579 --> 00:41:58,839
really a woman my self-esteem is totally

1109
00:41:56,980 --> 00:42:02,410
based on sleeping with heterosexual men

1110
00:41:58,839 --> 00:42:03,940
who them of my father and anyone who

1111
00:42:02,410 --> 00:42:05,829
knows anything about trans women knows

1112
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:08,079
that most of us go through a stage like

1113
00:42:05,829 --> 00:42:10,329
this at some point and some youtubers

1114
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:12,790
never get out of it but personally I

1115
00:42:10,329 --> 00:42:15,640
mean these days it doesn't matter what I

1116
00:42:12,790 --> 00:42:20,319
wear it's when I dream there Lilly's

1117
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:21,970
dreams ha dragging the Danish girl well

1118
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:23,530
[ __ ] the Danish I could never abide that

1119
00:42:21,970 --> 00:42:25,390
sort of person we all know what I'm

1120
00:42:23,530 --> 00:42:26,880
talking about you can tell them the

1121
00:42:25,390 --> 00:42:29,500
whisky is getting to me because I'm

1122
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:32,079
being bigoted against the Danish these

1123
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:34,930
things come out you know you get honest

1124
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:36,250
you get real when you get a little bit

1125
00:42:34,930 --> 00:42:38,650
of the Irish in your system did I just

1126
00:42:36,250 --> 00:42:40,990
[ __ ] put lipstick outside the [ __ ]

1127
00:42:38,650 --> 00:42:44,170
lipliner this is all Billie's fault

1128
00:42:40,990 --> 00:42:45,970
Lily Alba [ __ ] her dreams the point is

1129
00:42:44,170 --> 00:42:47,680
when I was making the aesthetic I wasn't

1130
00:42:45,970 --> 00:42:49,359
even thinking about non-binary people

1131
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:51,400
and people will say that the fact that

1132
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:54,190
not every video I make references

1133
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:56,980
non-binary people is itself and be

1134
00:42:54,190 --> 00:43:00,119
phobic as I said about 1 in 10 of my

1135
00:42:56,980 --> 00:43:03,880
videos is about non-binary identity but

1136
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:05,950
not all of them are and I feel entitled

1137
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:08,470
to make some videos that are just about

1138
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:10,059
trans women but still some people on

1139
00:43:08,470 --> 00:43:14,500
Twitter were saying that the character

1140
00:43:10,059 --> 00:43:17,640
Justine is a trans medical esteem a B

1141
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:21,339
wins the fictional debate in the video I

1142
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:25,690
Natalie win am therefore a trans medical

1143
00:43:21,339 --> 00:43:28,440
Asteria chiva t theory of gender the one

1144
00:43:25,690 --> 00:43:31,299
that Justine defends in that video is

1145
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:33,460
conceptually as far away from trans

1146
00:43:31,299 --> 00:43:35,500
medical ism as it is possible to be

1147
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:37,660
trans medical ISM says that trans

1148
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:39,640
identity is biological it's neurological

1149
00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:40,299
its hormonal its diagnosable and

1150
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:42,799
treatable

1151
00:43:40,299 --> 00:43:45,229
whereas performativity says that

1152
00:43:42,799 --> 00:43:47,509
gender is gesture its expression its

1153
00:43:45,229 --> 00:43:52,369
performance it's a social phenomenon

1154
00:43:47,509 --> 00:43:54,739
phenomenon phenomenon phenomena mannan

1155
00:43:52,369 --> 00:43:56,839
phenomenon performativity it makes no

1156
00:43:54,739 --> 00:43:58,640
reference to gender dysphoria or to any

1157
00:43:56,839 --> 00:44:00,829
kind of medical concept at all

1158
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:03,799
so whereas trans medical ism is a kind

1159
00:44:00,829 --> 00:44:06,140
of bio essentialism performativity is a

1160
00:44:03,799 --> 00:44:08,420
kind of social constructionism so these

1161
00:44:06,140 --> 00:44:11,259
are exact opposite theories of gender

1162
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:13,880
are you following along class I'm not

1163
00:44:11,259 --> 00:44:15,799
ready to drink jameson and tea until i

1164
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:18,170
died but some trans people felt

1165
00:44:15,799 --> 00:44:21,319
invalidated by things justine says in

1166
00:44:18,170 --> 00:44:22,699
that video and trans medical ism is

1167
00:44:21,319 --> 00:44:25,609
another thing that makes them feel

1168
00:44:22,699 --> 00:44:27,499
invalidated so they decided that justine

1169
00:44:25,609 --> 00:44:29,959
is a trans medical list and therefore

1170
00:44:27,499 --> 00:44:32,179
that i am a trans medical list and this

1171
00:44:29,959 --> 00:44:34,369
is literally just bad a media

1172
00:44:32,179 --> 00:44:37,309
comprehension like it's a failure to

1173
00:44:34,369 --> 00:44:39,529
plausibly interpret a video that some

1174
00:44:37,309 --> 00:44:41,359
people did find genuinely emotionally

1175
00:44:39,529 --> 00:44:43,039
difficult and so to the negative

1176
00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:45,469
response to that video is just pure

1177
00:44:43,039 --> 00:44:48,019
emotion I always hear I don't care what

1178
00:44:45,469 --> 00:44:50,660
you intended trans people were hurt by

1179
00:44:48,019 --> 00:44:52,489
that video you hurt trans people but

1180
00:44:50,660 --> 00:44:54,979
here's the thing just because you were

1181
00:44:52,489 --> 00:44:56,809
hurt by content I made doesn't mean that

1182
00:44:54,979 --> 00:44:58,999
the content is bad or that I'm

1183
00:44:56,809 --> 00:45:01,369
victimizing you in some way I'll give an

1184
00:44:58,999 --> 00:45:04,400
example I did a stream a couple years

1185
00:45:01,369 --> 00:45:06,199
ago with a BDSM and kink activist we

1186
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:09,589
were talking about various kinks and we

1187
00:45:06,199 --> 00:45:12,439
got to DDL G which is Daddy dawn little

1188
00:45:09,589 --> 00:45:15,140
girl basically when consenting adults

1189
00:45:12,439 --> 00:45:16,999
roleplay age difference in the power

1190
00:45:15,140 --> 00:45:18,229
dynamic that comes with that and me and

1191
00:45:16,999 --> 00:45:20,689
this kink activists who are just

1192
00:45:18,229 --> 00:45:23,509
casually discussing what DD LG is what

1193
00:45:20,689 --> 00:45:25,579
it isn't when I noticed someone in the

1194
00:45:23,509 --> 00:45:27,499
chat was starting to totally freak out

1195
00:45:25,579 --> 00:45:30,349
they were typing in all caps like my

1196
00:45:27,499 --> 00:45:32,509
abuser used DD LG to justify raping me

1197
00:45:30,349 --> 00:45:34,759
why are you defending my abuser I can't

1198
00:45:32,509 --> 00:45:37,160
believe you'd betray me like this please

1199
00:45:34,759 --> 00:45:39,140
stop taking my abusers side please stop

1200
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:41,119
I'm begging you this was actually really

1201
00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:43,549
[ __ ] upsetting to me because this

1202
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:45,799
person was clearly in a lot of pain they

1203
00:45:43,549 --> 00:45:48,410
were having a panic attack because they

1204
00:45:45,799 --> 00:45:49,309
were having a trauma trigger reaction to

1205
00:45:48,410 --> 00:45:51,469
this conversation

1206
00:45:49,309 --> 00:45:53,239
and I kept telling them to leave the

1207
00:45:51,469 --> 00:45:56,030
stream and take care of themselves but

1208
00:45:53,239 --> 00:45:57,830
they wouldn't do it so I had to block

1209
00:45:56,030 --> 00:46:01,340
and then later get in touch and make

1210
00:45:57,830 --> 00:46:02,930
sure they were okay now was there pain

1211
00:46:01,340 --> 00:46:05,240
very real yes

1212
00:46:02,930 --> 00:46:07,910
was it triggered by the content I was

1213
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:09,040
streaming yes but does that mean I did

1214
00:46:07,910 --> 00:46:12,410
anything wrong

1215
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:14,270
no is it wrong to talk about kink and

1216
00:46:12,410 --> 00:46:17,930
contacts where it's clear you're going

1217
00:46:14,270 --> 00:46:19,700
to be talking about kink no but when you

1218
00:46:17,930 --> 00:46:21,590
produce content online that's going to

1219
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:23,630
be viewed by thousands or millions of

1220
00:46:21,590 --> 00:46:25,820
people there's always some people out

1221
00:46:23,630 --> 00:46:27,680
there who are going to be hurt by it so

1222
00:46:25,820 --> 00:46:31,640
if you want to argue that a tweet or a

1223
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:33,380
video I made is somehow immoral I think

1224
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:36,109
you need more of an argument than just

1225
00:46:33,380 --> 00:46:38,720
people were hurt all right back to the

1226
00:46:36,109 --> 00:46:40,460
tweet to this day people quote tweet the

1227
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:41,960
sentence but surely an account that

1228
00:46:40,460 --> 00:46:43,609
begins and ends with I'm not a man

1229
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:45,440
because I don't identify as one is

1230
00:46:43,609 --> 00:46:47,480
pretty weak and they claimed this as

1231
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:48,980
evidence that I'm true scum or that I

1232
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:51,560
think people have to prove their

1233
00:46:48,980 --> 00:46:53,570
identities somehow which is not at all

1234
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:55,910
what I was saying in that thread when I

1235
00:46:53,570 --> 00:46:58,640
was saying is if you're trying to

1236
00:46:55,910 --> 00:47:01,369
persuade a skeptic that trans identity

1237
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:03,410
is valid simply saying I'm not a man

1238
00:47:01,369 --> 00:47:06,290
because I don't identify as one isn't a

1239
00:47:03,410 --> 00:47:07,880
very good argument which it isn't I mean

1240
00:47:06,290 --> 00:47:10,400
no one has ever been persuaded by that

1241
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:12,470
so far as I'm aware that said I do now

1242
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:14,540
disagree with the mindset I had when I

1243
00:47:12,470 --> 00:47:16,490
tweeted this back fan I still

1244
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:18,680
delusionally believed that it was

1245
00:47:16,490 --> 00:47:20,630
possible to rationally explain why trans

1246
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:22,490
identity is valid and I was simply

1247
00:47:20,630 --> 00:47:25,010
looking for a more persuasive argument

1248
00:47:22,490 --> 00:47:27,500
then this is how I identify you have to

1249
00:47:25,010 --> 00:47:29,480
believe me no further questions but I no

1250
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:31,520
longer believe there can be any rational

1251
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:33,230
justification of gender identity which

1252
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:35,420
is another reason I'm not a trans matica

1253
00:47:33,230 --> 00:47:37,670
list trans medical ism tries to be a

1254
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:39,320
rational theory about why trans identity

1255
00:47:37,670 --> 00:47:41,869
is valid and I don't think it succeeds

1256
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:43,940
as that I don't think anything does my

1257
00:47:41,869 --> 00:47:45,859
current opinion about this is that I'm

1258
00:47:43,940 --> 00:47:49,010
not a man because I don't identify as

1259
00:47:45,859 --> 00:47:51,740
one is as good or rather as bad an

1260
00:47:49,010 --> 00:47:54,020
argument as any you know some things in

1261
00:47:51,740 --> 00:47:56,900
life just can't be rationally explained

1262
00:47:54,020 --> 00:47:59,480
like love why do you love the person you

1263
00:47:56,900 --> 00:48:01,280
love well because you love them you

1264
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:03,380
could write a poem about it or some gay

1265
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:07,440
[ __ ] like that but you can't give any

1266
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:09,869
actual arguments and to why am i a woman

1267
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:11,670
because in the life that's it I mean I

1268
00:48:09,869 --> 00:48:13,319
can describe my experiences and my

1269
00:48:11,670 --> 00:48:15,900
feelings to you to help you understand

1270
00:48:13,319 --> 00:48:18,480
better but I can't logically prove

1271
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:20,970
anything and I'm super [ __ ] sorry if

1272
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:23,220
you can't handle that mankind was set

1273
00:48:20,970 --> 00:48:25,530
adrift in an absurd world that must be

1274
00:48:23,220 --> 00:48:27,780
super [ __ ] hard for you tell me all

1275
00:48:25,530 --> 00:48:30,210
about it next please

1276
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:32,640
okay again we're mid thread with missing

1277
00:48:30,210 --> 00:48:34,619
context but the tweet says whereas I've

1278
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:36,930
met 20 year olds and full-on boy mode

1279
00:48:34,619 --> 00:48:40,140
who are like hi I'm a trans woman she

1280
00:48:36,930 --> 00:48:41,910
heard pronouns so I guess by including

1281
00:48:40,140 --> 00:48:44,849
this tweet in the contra points is

1282
00:48:41,910 --> 00:48:47,190
problematic collage people are implying

1283
00:48:44,849 --> 00:48:49,230
that I don't think it's valid for

1284
00:48:47,190 --> 00:48:50,579
someone who presents male to identify as

1285
00:48:49,230 --> 00:48:53,579
a woman and requests she/her pronouns

1286
00:48:50,579 --> 00:48:55,200
well that's not true I was surprised

1287
00:48:53,579 --> 00:48:58,920
when I first experienced this but I

1288
00:48:55,200 --> 00:49:01,140
think it's valid next okay mid thread no

1289
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:03,180
context once again but now you go into

1290
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:05,369
these leftist discord / Facebook groups

1291
00:49:03,180 --> 00:49:07,470
and like 20 to 30 percent identify as

1292
00:49:05,369 --> 00:49:09,270
some flavor of trans most of them are

1293
00:49:07,470 --> 00:49:12,329
not conventional binary transsexuals

1294
00:49:09,270 --> 00:49:14,460
that seems to be the future okay well

1295
00:49:12,329 --> 00:49:16,589
it's true that many left his discord

1296
00:49:14,460 --> 00:49:19,130
servers are like this but reading this

1297
00:49:16,589 --> 00:49:21,569
back I don't like the way the phrase

1298
00:49:19,130 --> 00:49:23,339
conventional binary transsexuals is

1299
00:49:21,569 --> 00:49:25,530
hitting my ear I can see how it could

1300
00:49:23,339 --> 00:49:28,020
imply that non-binary identities are

1301
00:49:25,530 --> 00:49:29,940
somehow newfangled which isn't true

1302
00:49:28,020 --> 00:49:31,619
there's been non-binary people for

1303
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:34,410
longer than there's been medical

1304
00:49:31,619 --> 00:49:36,839
transsexuals in fact so we'll call this

1305
00:49:34,410 --> 00:49:39,569
a bad tweet I apologize for tweeting it

1306
00:49:36,839 --> 00:49:43,440
and I apologize to any non-binary people

1307
00:49:39,569 --> 00:49:45,329
who felt trivialized by it okay this is

1308
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:47,460
the big one this tweet got its own

1309
00:49:45,329 --> 00:49:48,720
article in the [ __ ] Guardian you know

1310
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:50,460
I really wish people would pay less

1311
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:52,140
attention to the tweets I spend 30

1312
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:54,329
seconds rating and a little more

1313
00:49:52,140 --> 00:49:57,480
attention to the videos that I spend you

1314
00:49:54,329 --> 00:49:59,069
know hundreds of hours making anyway

1315
00:49:57,480 --> 00:50:00,960
let's look at the tweet this is the most

1316
00:49:59,069 --> 00:50:03,930
scrutinized paragraph I've ever written

1317
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:06,390
and it's so mediocre this has happened

1318
00:50:03,930 --> 00:50:08,250
to me before in hyper woke spaces like

1319
00:50:06,390 --> 00:50:10,109
it's me and a bunch of sis women and we

1320
00:50:08,250 --> 00:50:11,790
all have to go in a circle saying she

1321
00:50:10,109 --> 00:50:13,710
her because I'm there there's this

1322
00:50:11,790 --> 00:50:15,720
paradox where I can go to a sports bar

1323
00:50:13,710 --> 00:50:17,190
in North Carolina and be miss ma'am doll

1324
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:19,020
night no question but in

1325
00:50:17,190 --> 00:50:21,090
self-consciously trans inclusive spaces

1326
00:50:19,020 --> 00:50:22,920
I have to explain my pronouns

1327
00:50:21,090 --> 00:50:25,080
and watch woke people up wordly corrects

1328
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:26,850
themselves every time they say you guys

1329
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:28,260
I guess it's good for people who use

1330
00:50:26,850 --> 00:50:30,120
they/them only and want only

1331
00:50:28,260 --> 00:50:32,760
gender-neutral language but it comes at

1332
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:35,220
the minor expense of semi possible

1333
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:37,950
trances like me and that's super [ __ ]

1334
00:50:35,220 --> 00:50:40,590
hard for us so people interpreted this

1335
00:50:37,950 --> 00:50:43,890
tweet as me being against the practice

1336
00:50:40,590 --> 00:50:45,840
of sharing pronouns which I'm literally

1337
00:50:43,890 --> 00:50:47,940
just not like I've actually been the

1338
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:50,370
person who initiates the pronoun circle

1339
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:53,070
many times the backstory of this tweet

1340
00:50:50,370 --> 00:50:56,040
is basically that I once got triggered

1341
00:50:53,070 --> 00:50:57,990
in a situation where I was with a bunch

1342
00:50:56,040 --> 00:51:00,720
of sis women and we all had to go around

1343
00:50:57,990 --> 00:51:03,540
saying our pronouns and like a typical

1344
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:06,570
triggered truck I tiptoed over to

1345
00:51:03,540 --> 00:51:08,130
Twitter that tip top type it out but

1346
00:51:06,570 --> 00:51:10,230
here's the thing but the end of this

1347
00:51:08,130 --> 00:51:11,970
thread I had already talked myself away

1348
00:51:10,230 --> 00:51:14,070
from the initial frustration I was

1349
00:51:11,970 --> 00:51:16,530
expressing if you know my videos in my

1350
00:51:14,070 --> 00:51:19,800
voice then you know me saying it comes

1351
00:51:16,530 --> 00:51:22,800
at the minor expense of semi possible

1352
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:27,480
trances in a super [ __ ] hard for us

1353
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:30,390
is sarcastic it's a minor expense it's

1354
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:33,690
not actually very hard for us gorge it's

1355
00:51:30,390 --> 00:51:36,360
fine the people on Twitter don't watch

1356
00:51:33,690 --> 00:51:40,770
my videos and they don't get sarcasm

1357
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:43,080
so people flipped out over this I was

1358
00:51:40,770 --> 00:51:45,330
getting dragged and it made the poor

1359
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:48,780
decision to try to solve the tweet

1360
00:51:45,330 --> 00:51:50,730
problem with more tweeting which 100% of

1361
00:51:48,780 --> 00:51:53,820
the time is like trying to put out a

1362
00:51:50,730 --> 00:51:55,800
fire with lighter fluid so me and my

1363
00:51:53,820 --> 00:51:57,810
dumb brain did another short thread

1364
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:59,370
trying to clarify what I was saying and

1365
00:51:57,810 --> 00:52:02,130
defending my right to talk about my own

1366
00:51:59,370 --> 00:52:04,560
experiences that didn't make things any

1367
00:52:02,130 --> 00:52:06,900
better so in a state of anger and

1368
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:09,630
frustration I tweeted out yet another

1369
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:11,460
thread and this time I said some truly

1370
00:52:09,630 --> 00:52:15,390
stupid things including the now-infamous

1371
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:18,840
line I sometimes feel like the last of

1372
00:52:15,390 --> 00:52:20,460
the old-school transsexuals I honestly

1373
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:23,280
don't know what the [ __ ] I was even

1374
00:52:20,460 --> 00:52:26,340
trying to say I don't feel like the last

1375
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:28,050
of the old-school transsexuals I don't

1376
00:52:26,340 --> 00:52:31,230
even know what that means I guess I

1377
00:52:28,050 --> 00:52:33,360
basically meant that offline I don't

1378
00:52:31,230 --> 00:52:34,730
have any radical aspirations you know I

1379
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:37,010
want to be inconspicuous

1380
00:52:34,730 --> 00:52:38,900
I want to blend in and that's what I

1381
00:52:37,010 --> 00:52:41,060
meant by old school you know I want

1382
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:43,220
people to assume my pronouns you know

1383
00:52:41,060 --> 00:52:44,990
it's funny because it is very different

1384
00:52:43,220 --> 00:52:47,390
from the way I am online where I'm

1385
00:52:44,990 --> 00:52:49,640
totally shameless and open I'm like

1386
00:52:47,390 --> 00:52:56,930
sexual confession everybody's sexual

1387
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:58,610
confession I have abnormal urges they

1388
00:52:56,930 --> 00:53:01,730
know I have abnormal urges now they

1389
00:52:58,610 --> 00:53:04,070
already knew that but often I'm an

1390
00:53:01,730 --> 00:53:08,360
inconspicuous [ __ ] like a total coward

1391
00:53:04,070 --> 00:53:16,550
so this was a rage thread and I

1392
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:19,250
apologize for tweeting it let's go back

1393
00:53:16,550 --> 00:53:21,350
to bug angel I'm kind of a conscientious

1394
00:53:19,250 --> 00:53:22,760
objector to the practice of condemning

1395
00:53:21,350 --> 00:53:25,130
someone based on a collage of their

1396
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:27,320
worst tweets taken out of context but I

1397
00:53:25,130 --> 00:53:29,600
definitely do have anxiety about this

1398
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:31,490
like I think I'm doing the right thing

1399
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:35,150
by not condemning buck as true scum and

1400
00:53:31,490 --> 00:53:37,160
evil but I mean I could be wrong what if

1401
00:53:35,150 --> 00:53:39,230
I am basically sacrificing myself for

1402
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:41,420
the sake of a person who really is as

1403
00:53:39,230 --> 00:53:43,490
bad as Twitter says maybe tomorrow he'll

1404
00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:46,640
tweet [ __ ] non-binary people and then

1405
00:53:43,490 --> 00:53:49,250
I'll have [ __ ] up this whole thing is

1406
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:51,890
incredibly stressful to me but I do

1407
00:53:49,250 --> 00:53:54,860
believe that by refusing to participate

1408
00:53:51,890 --> 00:53:57,290
in the anti buck angel pile on I am

1409
00:53:54,860 --> 00:53:59,030
airing on the morally safer side of

1410
00:53:57,290 --> 00:54:01,580
things because even if he is a little

1411
00:53:59,030 --> 00:54:04,310
true scummy excommunicating him from the

1412
00:54:01,580 --> 00:54:05,720
trans community is still probably not

1413
00:54:04,310 --> 00:54:07,880
the best approach to take in my

1414
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:10,340
experience when people accept binary but

1415
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:12,590
not non-binary trans people it usually

1416
00:54:10,340 --> 00:54:14,360
takes like a 30 minute conversation to

1417
00:54:12,590 --> 00:54:16,550
win them over to some level of

1418
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:18,590
non-binary acceptance it'll give you a

1419
00:54:16,550 --> 00:54:21,110
couple examples the first time I was

1420
00:54:18,590 --> 00:54:24,050
ever cancelled like totally trashed on

1421
00:54:21,110 --> 00:54:25,910
Twitter was back in 2017 when I had not

1422
00:54:24,050 --> 00:54:28,120
yet medically transitioned and at the

1423
00:54:25,910 --> 00:54:32,060
time I identified as non-binary and

1424
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:34,190
VidCon 2017 I met up with a youtuber

1425
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:36,500
named June who had made some videos

1426
00:54:34,190 --> 00:54:38,960
where she basically mocked the idea of

1427
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:41,720
non-binary people and I posted a picture

1428
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:43,310
of the brunch I had with June and some

1429
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:45,260
other people but let's keep them out of

1430
00:54:43,310 --> 00:54:47,369
it and people on Twitter totally dragged

1431
00:54:45,260 --> 00:54:48,749
me for being a peak liberal boot licker

1432
00:54:47,369 --> 00:54:54,119
who's best friends with transphobic

1433
00:54:48,749 --> 00:54:56,309
abusers Christ [ __ ] people man so

1434
00:54:54,119 --> 00:54:58,140
[ __ ] frustrating and you know I'm not

1435
00:54:56,309 --> 00:54:59,549
gonna claim I change June's mind because

1436
00:54:58,140 --> 00:55:01,529
I don't know what her thought process

1437
00:54:59,549 --> 00:55:03,900
was but I did talk to her about

1438
00:55:01,529 --> 00:55:06,150
non-binary identity and she did remove

1439
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:09,470
her anti non-binary videos and I don't

1440
00:55:06,150 --> 00:55:09,470
have any regrets about that brunch

1441
00:55:12,289 --> 00:55:18,119
example - a couple months later I did a

1442
00:55:15,779 --> 00:55:22,799
livestream with a conservative trans

1443
00:55:18,119 --> 00:55:23,249
woman youtuber named um what was her

1444
00:55:22,799 --> 00:55:26,249
name

1445
00:55:23,249 --> 00:55:28,049
Sharon Sharon was it Sharon I guess

1446
00:55:26,249 --> 00:55:28,589
she's just not a very memorable person

1447
00:55:28,049 --> 00:55:30,509
anyway

1448
00:55:28,589 --> 00:55:32,700
she had made some videos saying that

1449
00:55:30,509 --> 00:55:34,650
non-binary identities aren't real but I

1450
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:36,329
gave her a chance and she surprised me

1451
00:55:34,650 --> 00:55:38,309
by being super compassionate and

1452
00:55:36,329 --> 00:55:40,019
thoughtful by the end of that stream she

1453
00:55:38,309 --> 00:55:41,940
was pretty much totally accepting of my

1454
00:55:40,019 --> 00:55:43,890
identity so again the point is not that

1455
00:55:41,940 --> 00:55:45,660
I'm some kind of persuasive genius if I

1456
00:55:43,890 --> 00:55:47,579
was a persuasive genius maybe I could

1457
00:55:45,660 --> 00:55:50,369
talk myself out of being cancelled the

1458
00:55:47,579 --> 00:55:52,470
point is that sometimes people who seem

1459
00:55:50,369 --> 00:55:54,809
ignorant or hateful just need to be

1460
00:55:52,470 --> 00:55:57,089
given a non-judgmental space to learn

1461
00:55:54,809 --> 00:55:58,529
and grow and think and to just condemn

1462
00:55:57,089 --> 00:56:00,210
them as hopeless bigots actually

1463
00:55:58,529 --> 00:56:01,109
prevents that growth from happening and

1464
00:56:00,210 --> 00:56:03,269
Sharon

1465
00:56:01,109 --> 00:56:04,680
despite her you know totally forgettable

1466
00:56:03,269 --> 00:56:06,809
personality turned out to be an

1467
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:08,700
incredibly open-minded person like later

1468
00:56:06,809 --> 00:56:10,529
on she actually made an apology video to

1469
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:12,869
non-binary people and I became good

1470
00:56:10,529 --> 00:56:14,579
friends with her and we work together on

1471
00:56:12,869 --> 00:56:16,470
most of the videos I've made this year

1472
00:56:14,579 --> 00:56:17,970
you know until she ruined my life by

1473
00:56:16,470 --> 00:56:20,430
recommending and canceled John Waters

1474
00:56:17,970 --> 00:56:22,589
impersonator I guess the moral is never

1475
00:56:20,430 --> 00:56:25,970
talk to people you disagree with it will

1476
00:56:22,589 --> 00:56:25,970
only lead to pain

1477
00:56:26,030 --> 00:56:34,570
[Music]

1478
00:56:31,990 --> 00:56:37,119
I do think there's something off with my

1479
00:56:34,570 --> 00:56:39,430
hormone Davis like I'm crying three

1480
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:41,020
times a day oh and I can't calm in less

1481
00:56:39,430 --> 00:56:41,710
there's vibrators and at least three of

1482
00:56:41,020 --> 00:56:43,510
my holes

1483
00:56:41,710 --> 00:56:45,460
it happens like once a month there has

1484
00:56:43,510 --> 00:56:47,230
to be a full moon I honestly only still

1485
00:56:45,460 --> 00:56:49,150
bother because it numbs the pain for a

1486
00:56:47,230 --> 00:56:51,280
few moments what I'm trying to say is I

1487
00:56:49,150 --> 00:56:52,570
really do believe in conversation which

1488
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:54,520
means a hearing out multiple

1489
00:56:52,570 --> 00:56:55,869
perspectives I don't want my audience to

1490
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:57,730
get all their information about trans

1491
00:56:55,869 --> 00:56:59,680
people from me and I think it's

1492
00:56:57,730 --> 00:57:02,140
important to listen to criticism so I

1493
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:03,970
encourage my audience to go watch some

1494
00:57:02,140 --> 00:57:06,520
non-binary youtubers who have criticized

1495
00:57:03,970 --> 00:57:08,980
me and criticized buck angel for example

1496
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:11,230
go check out non-binary youtuber look

1497
00:57:08,980 --> 00:57:13,240
Sanders video about me and non-binary

1498
00:57:11,230 --> 00:57:16,510
youtuber cORFO days video about buck

1499
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:19,240
angel I think YouTube as a platform is

1500
00:57:16,510 --> 00:57:21,400
better at producing criticism rather

1501
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:23,550
than canceling and I think that's

1502
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:26,320
because at least in the vlog format

1503
00:57:23,550 --> 00:57:28,359
making a video forces you to confront

1504
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:30,550
the fact that you're a human being with

1505
00:57:28,359 --> 00:57:32,200
a face and a name who can be held

1506
00:57:30,550 --> 00:57:34,599
accountable for the things that you say

1507
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:35,950
but people on Twitter it's a different

1508
00:57:34,599 --> 00:57:38,140
story and I think it's time we take a

1509
00:57:35,950 --> 00:57:40,060
look at what canceling really is I've

1510
00:57:38,140 --> 00:57:41,560
given you enough context now for you to

1511
00:57:40,060 --> 00:57:44,020
understand what I'm about to show you

1512
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:46,270
which is what I saw on my timeline every

1513
00:57:44,020 --> 00:57:48,490
day for nearly a month all these tweets

1514
00:57:46,270 --> 00:57:50,920
are from the aftermath of my uploading

1515
00:57:48,490 --> 00:57:53,290
opulence two months ago when the buck

1516
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:54,910
angel scandal first broke and so I'm

1517
00:57:53,290 --> 00:57:56,100
gonna hold my hands now because this

1518
00:57:54,910 --> 00:57:58,150
gets ugly

1519
00:57:56,100 --> 00:58:01,220
[Applause]

1520
00:57:58,150 --> 00:58:02,540

00:58:02,540 --> 00:58:06,620

00:58:16,130 --> 00:58:18,860
how I'm 30 and trans and managed not to

00:58:17,990 --> 00:58:20,600
be a true scum

1530
00:58:18,860 --> 00:58:22,550
maybe I'm just some kind of anomaly or

1531
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:24,530
maybe contra points is a conniving rat

1532
00:58:22,550 --> 00:58:26,750
[ __ ] cop oh who could do with a fully

1533
00:58:24,530 --> 00:58:28,580

00:58:30,860 --> 00:58:35,060
ethics stance and all her bread tube

1537
00:58:32,930 --> 00:58:36,590
chavez who closed ranks to protect her

1538
00:58:35,060 --> 00:58:38,600
after she throws the rest of the trans

1539
00:58:36,590 --> 00:58:40,820
community under the bus for profit

1540
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:42,440
Natalie Wynn is a [ __ ] grifter contra

1541
00:58:40,820 --> 00:58:44,420
points videos are now just style of her

1542
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:46,700
substance so that explains why she took

1543
00:58:44,420 --> 00:58:48,590
to turf ideology so well contra points

1544
00:58:46,700 --> 00:58:50,420
working with true scum now definitively

1545
00:58:48,590 --> 00:58:52,490
proves that pretty much everyone

1546
00:58:50,420 --> 00:58:54,800
defending contra points just hates and

1547
00:58:52,490 --> 00:58:56,600
B's and are also true scum legit gonna

1548
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:58,040
start on following peeps that continue

1549
00:58:56,600 --> 00:59:00,410
to follow contra points at this point

1550
00:58:58,040 --> 00:59:02,360
dunno my wedding of pretty much everyone

1551
00:59:00,410 --> 00:59:05,090
I know there are some that were probably

1552
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:06,830
blindsided by this somehow so long as

1553
00:59:05,090 --> 00:59:10,070
you know that contra points is true scum

1554
00:59:06,830 --> 00:59:11,780

genderqueer we expected more from you

1557
00:59:13,850 --> 00:59:17,180
but I guess when your heads this far up

1558
00:59:15,410 --> 00:59:19,340
your own ass it's hard to consider

1559
00:59:17,180 --> 00:59:21,920

1566
00:59:33,830 --> 00:59:37,970
Natalie refuses to accept that she has

1567
00:59:36,230 --> 00:59:40,010
an apology to make and continues

1568
00:59:37,970 --> 00:59:41,900
profiting from it it will become our

1569
00:59:40,010 --> 00:59:43,700
responsibility to work on deep

1570
00:59:41,900 --> 00:59:47,000
platforming earth just like every other

1571
00:59:43,700 --> 00:59:48,830
racist sexist bigoted content creator no

1572
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:50,780
one has actually suggested or attempted

1573
00:59:48,830 --> 00:59:52,460
to actually cancel her but the longer

1574
00:59:50,780 --> 00:59:53,570
this goes on without an apology and

1575
00:59:52,460 --> 00:59:55,490
commitment to be better

1576
00:59:53,570 --> 00:59:58,070
the stronger the case becomes for

1577
00:59:55,490 --> 00:59:59,900
actively working to deport her so in

1578
00:59:58,070 --> 01:00:03,710
other words no one has suggested we

1579
00:59:59,900 --> 01:00:06,050
cancel her but we should cancel her we

1580
01:00:03,710 --> 01:00:07,670

tiring to watch this happen every week

1604
01:00:56,400 --> 01:01:00,690

01:01:00,690 --> 01:01:04,260
who supports Natalie wins does not

01:01:16,620 --> 01:01:21,000
validity of non-binary genders and

1614
01:01:18,300 --> 01:01:22,740

01:01:39,410 --> 01:01:43,800
association with him must be seen as

1624
01:01:41,910 --> 01:01:44,160
hostile to the trans community as a

1625
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:45,900
whole

1626
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:48,240
that alone denial of non-binary

this is natalie natalie is a trans

medical list this is Natalie's friend

1633
01:02:06,810 --> 01:02:12,030
Lindsey Lindsey is a left tuber Natalie

1634
01:02:10,080 --> 01:02:14,940
and Lindsey are still friends because

1635
01:02:12,030 --> 01:02:18,020
Natalie and I are both cowards

1636
01:02:14,940 --> 01:02:20,930
left to Missa Greg Owen they made me the

1637
01:02:18,020 --> 01:02:23,690
the shaky issues that arose with one

1638
01:02:20,930 --> 01:02:25,610
being in contras new video her video on

1639
01:02:23,690 --> 01:02:27,500
turfs make no sense now her video on

1640
01:02:25,610 --> 01:02:29,270
trans Trender is making no sense now you

01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:30,560
know if your interpretation of why I

cast bug angel

1643
01:02:30,560 --> 01:02:34,550
totally contradicts the videos I spent

1644
01:02:32,630 --> 01:02:36,230
hundreds of hours making do you think

1645
01:02:34,550 --> 01:02:39,290
maybe your interpretation could be wrong

1646
01:02:36,230 --> 01:02:41,210
apparently not her apology is completely

1647
01:02:39,290 --> 01:02:42,260
Floyd sends a message that she hates

1648
01:02:41,210 --> 01:02:44,120
non-binary people

1649
01:02:42,260 --> 01:02:46,130
she is reckless with her content

patreon four hundred thousand this

1654
01:02:55,070 --> 01:03:03,230

1657
01:03:05,180 --> 01:03:09,860
leftist PewDiePie personally I like to

1658
01:03:07,340 --> 01:03:12,560
characterize her as the Blair White Wolf

1659
01:03:09,860 --> 01:03:14,780
and leftist sheep's clothing reminder

1660
01:03:12,560 --> 01:03:16,730
that contra points is a piece of [ __ ]

1661
01:03:14,780 --> 01:03:18,890
who still has not apologized her

1662
01:03:16,730 --> 01:03:20,090
platforming true scum and is actively

1663
01:03:18,890 --> 01:03:22,070
taking their side

1664
01:03:20,090 --> 01:03:24,680
anyway if you still support contra

1665
01:03:22,070 --> 01:03:27,140

1666
01:03:24,680 --> 01:03:28,880
poo-poo i'm contra points and i can't

1667

[ __ ] myself in public huh valid

01:03:32,810 --> 01:03:39,110
criticisms of marginalized people [ __ ]

1670
01:03:35,750 --> 01:03:41,510
contra point [ __ ] tristan contra points

1671
01:03:39,110 --> 01:03:43,580

1673
01:03:43,580 --> 01:03:47,660
contra points is a true skog carter

1674
01:03:46,250 --> 01:03:49,670
points an so tricky you know when you

1675
01:03:47,660 --> 01:03:52,340
repeat the same [ __ ] sentence over

1676
01:03:49,670 --> 01:03:55,220
and over and then you don't repeat the

1677
01:03:52,340 --> 01:03:57,500
same sentence over and over good arcade

1678
01:03:55,220 --> 01:03:59,780
doesn't get more persuasive in fact and

1679
01:03:57,500 --> 01:04:02,530
might get less persuasive because true

1680
01:03:59,780 --> 01:04:04,970
things usually only had to be said once

1681
01:04:02,530 --> 01:04:07,040
if you still support content points

1682
01:04:04,970 --> 01:04:08,750
unfollow me immediately and never

1683
01:04:07,040 --> 01:04:11,690
interact with me again

1684
01:04:08,750 --> 01:04:13,940
in conclusion [ __ ] natalie win and [ __ ]

1685
01:04:11,690 --> 01:04:19,630
everything she has to say

1686
01:04:13,940 --> 01:04:19,630
[Music]

1687
01:04:23,500 --> 01:04:28,820
okay let's get started

1688
01:04:26,210 --> 01:04:30,920
so that was just a sample of hundreds

1689
01:04:28,820 --> 01:04:33,980
and hundreds of tweets and all of this

1690
01:04:30,920 --> 01:04:36,800
let me remind you is over a ten-second

1691
01:04:33,980 --> 01:04:39,800
voice-over clip in a 48 minute video

1692
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:42,830
about a completely unrelated topic like

1693
01:04:39,800 --> 01:04:45,650
how do you work how do you create when a

1694
01:04:42,830 --> 01:04:47,750
decision so trivial can become the main

1695
01:04:45,650 --> 01:04:49,760
event for weeks of your life and the

1696
01:04:47,750 --> 01:04:51,080
tweets are just the beginning after that

1697
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:52,700
there's the reddit threads and the

1698
01:04:51,080 --> 01:04:54,770
YouTube comments in the Facebook

1699
01:04:52,700 --> 01:04:57,050
discourse in the medium posts in the

1700
01:04:54,770 --> 01:04:59,600
Newsweek article opulence is a video

1701
01:04:57,050 --> 01:05:02,030
being theron spent hundreds of hours

1702
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:04,430
carefully piecing together I think it's

1703
01:05:02,030 --> 01:05:06,830
my best video if to have the response to

1704
01:05:04,430 --> 01:05:09,050
it completely overwhelmed by one minor

1705
01:05:06,830 --> 01:05:11,510
and casting decision is heartbreaking

1706
01:05:09,050 --> 01:05:13,340
and infuriating to me and it's left me

1707
01:05:11,510 --> 01:05:15,590
with much less energy to create new

1708
01:05:13,340 --> 01:05:17,480
things but here's the thing people on

1709
01:05:15,590 --> 01:05:20,180
Twitter saying mean things about me is

1710
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:22,670
not the worst of it not even close

1711
01:05:20,180 --> 01:05:24,859
like I'm a politically opinionated trans

1712
01:05:22,670 --> 01:05:26,960
woman who publicly transitioned while

1713
01:05:24,859 --> 01:05:29,680
making anti-fascist content on a

1714
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:32,300
notoriously right-wing platform Oh

1715
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:34,550
sweaty I am so used to reading mean

1716
01:05:32,300 --> 01:05:36,980
things about myself online most of you

1717
01:05:34,550 --> 01:05:38,510
probably can't even begin to imagine how

1718
01:05:36,980 --> 01:05:39,830
used to it I am and the way you

1719
01:05:38,510 --> 01:05:42,020
psychologically survive in that

1720
01:05:39,830 --> 01:05:43,910
situation is you block the people in

1721
01:05:42,020 --> 01:05:46,160
platforms who are harassing you and you

1722
01:05:43,910 --> 01:05:48,859
pay it no mind but there's some things

1723
01:05:46,160 --> 01:05:51,050
you can't block and a big one is you

1724
01:05:48,859 --> 01:05:52,700
can't block people from going after your

1725
01:05:51,050 --> 01:05:55,220
friends and colleagues and that is

1726
01:05:52,700 --> 01:05:57,050
exactly what people did to me at the

1727
01:05:55,220 --> 01:05:59,480
height of the buck angel incident

1728
01:05:57,050 --> 01:06:01,850
Lindsey Ellis Ally from philosophy tube

1729
01:05:59,480 --> 01:06:04,369
and each bomber guy all got inundated

1730
01:06:01,850 --> 01:06:06,410
with tweets demanding that they publicly

1731
01:06:04,369 --> 01:06:09,890
disowned me a person they've all been

1732
01:06:06,410 --> 01:06:12,380
friends with for years or else in

1733
01:06:09,890 --> 01:06:14,210
response to demands that she apologized

1734
01:06:12,380 --> 01:06:16,910
Lindsey released a statement where she

1735
01:06:14,210 --> 01:06:18,710
said I was not involved in opulence my

1736
01:06:16,910 --> 01:06:21,109
name was mentioned in it but I did not

1737
01:06:18,710 --> 01:06:22,850
participate in the production therefore

1738
01:06:21,109 --> 01:06:24,630
with regards to calls for me to

1739
01:06:22,850 --> 01:06:28,080
apologize

1740
01:06:24,630 --> 01:06:30,660
ask apologize for what there is only one

1741
01:06:28,080 --> 01:06:33,000
logical answer apologize for being

1742
01:06:30,660 --> 01:06:35,130
friends with Natalie and here's a

1743
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:36,990
response to her statement I don't need

1744
01:06:35,130 --> 01:06:38,790
to consider you my [ __ ] friend to

1745
01:06:36,990 --> 01:06:40,680
disagree with beliefs you knowingly

1746
01:06:38,790 --> 01:06:42,810
solicit or allow on your platform

1747
01:06:40,680 --> 01:06:45,240
same with contra it just means you're

1748
01:06:42,810 --> 01:06:47,580
willing to allow awful ideas to fester

1749
01:06:45,240 --> 01:06:50,190
for the sake of financial gain which is

1750
01:06:47,580 --> 01:06:52,440
fine but it makes you a piece of [ __ ]

1751
01:06:50,190 --> 01:06:54,090
and here's a comment on each bomber guy

1752
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:55,950
I thought that you were gonna read this

1753
01:06:54,090 --> 01:06:58,080
but can you please just tell us your

1754
01:06:55,950 --> 01:06:59,760
thoughts on that whole situation so we

1755
01:06:58,080 --> 01:07:03,390
could at least know that you were on our

1756
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:05,970
side we don't want to have to cancel all

1757
01:07:03,390 --> 01:07:08,520
of y'all and cause bread tube to go into

1758
01:07:05,970 --> 01:07:10,770
a schism as a result of this thank you

1759
01:07:08,520 --> 01:07:12,870
nice YouTube channel you have fair

1760
01:07:10,770 --> 01:07:14,990
friend would be a shame of someone

1761
01:07:12,870 --> 01:07:18,330
canceled it

1762
01:07:14,990 --> 01:07:20,130
so [ __ ] Finister ally of philosophy

1763
01:07:18,330 --> 01:07:21,930
tube released his own statement

1764
01:07:20,130 --> 01:07:24,810
affirming his support of non-binary

1765
01:07:21,930 --> 01:07:27,330
people but adding sadly I've also been

1766
01:07:24,810 --> 01:07:29,310
harassed threatened doxed had my private

1767
01:07:27,330 --> 01:07:31,740
life speculated on and my loved ones

1768
01:07:29,310 --> 01:07:33,480
insulted and recognizing the feelings of

1769
01:07:31,740 --> 01:07:35,460
those who kindly raised their concerns

1770
01:07:33,480 --> 01:07:37,530
in a polite way I do not wish to

1771
01:07:35,460 --> 01:07:39,570
legitimize the great many people who use

1772
01:07:37,530 --> 01:07:41,760
their hurt as a cover for unacceptable

1773
01:07:39,570 --> 01:07:44,130
toxic and abusive behavior and here are

1774
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:46,800
some responses to oli as a non-binary

1775
01:07:44,130 --> 01:07:49,920
fan of yours I'm disappointed in this

1776
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:52,320
non apology again what exactly is he

1777
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:54,750
supposed to be apologising for ever

1778
01:07:52,320 --> 01:07:56,700
having associated with me things we are

1779
01:07:54,750 --> 01:07:59,280
going to criticize oli philosophy too

1780
01:07:56,700 --> 01:08:01,530
poor being a sniveling hypocritical

1781
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:03,660
piece of [ __ ] refusing to listen to

1782
01:08:01,530 --> 01:08:05,490
trans people actively openly and

1783
01:08:03,660 --> 01:08:07,560
repeatedly mocking the trans people he

1784
01:08:05,490 --> 01:08:09,690
refuses to listen to thanks for the

1785
01:08:07,560 --> 01:08:11,910
apology now stop and doors and contra

1786
01:08:09,690 --> 01:08:14,309
points now keep in mind that with these

1787
01:08:11,910 --> 01:08:18,119
Twitter people are doing is demand

1788
01:08:14,309 --> 01:08:20,609
that sis people publicly condemn a trans

1789
01:08:18,119 --> 01:08:22,650
woman for loosely associating with

1790
01:08:20,609 --> 01:08:25,049
another trans person does that strike

1791
01:08:22,650 --> 01:08:27,540
anyone else is wildly inappropriate even

1792
01:08:25,049 --> 01:08:29,909
me am older a trans woman who is never

1793
01:08:27,540 --> 01:08:32,819
publicly associated with me got attacked

1794
01:08:29,909 --> 01:08:34,739
because she tweeted a heart volley you

1795
01:08:32,819 --> 01:08:37,020
know after he made the post discussing

1796
01:08:34,739 --> 01:08:39,420
being dog stand threatened and just for

1797
01:08:37,020 --> 01:08:42,119
that she gets put on the enemy list I'm

1798
01:08:39,420 --> 01:08:45,929
sad to say that Mia is on the list of

1799
01:08:42,119 --> 01:08:48,809
people that have stood by contrapositive

1800
01:08:45,929 --> 01:08:51,869
piece of [ __ ] to which me responds stood

1801
01:08:48,809 --> 01:08:53,609
by contra points Jesus Christ no matter

1802
01:08:51,869 --> 01:08:54,960
what I do people call me out and I'm not

1803
01:08:53,609 --> 01:08:57,389
even related to the video and I don't

1804
01:08:54,960 --> 01:09:00,809
even know Natalie the chain of guilt by

1805
01:08:57,389 --> 01:09:03,059
association is so long and twisted I can

1806
01:09:00,809 --> 01:09:04,199
barely even follow it so they're going

1807
01:09:03,059 --> 01:09:07,049
after Mia

1808
01:09:04,199 --> 01:09:10,409
who tweeted a [ __ ] not oli who failed

1809
01:09:07,049 --> 01:09:13,290
to condemn me for my voice-over casting

1810
01:09:10,409 --> 01:09:15,420
of buck angel who was retweeted by a

1811
01:09:13,290 --> 01:09:17,219
Turk we're only missing a couple of

1812
01:09:15,420 --> 01:09:19,139
degrees of separation before every

1813
01:09:17,219 --> 01:09:21,690
living person on the planet Earth is

1814
01:09:19,139 --> 01:09:23,759
cancelled over the buck angels situation

1815
01:09:21,690 --> 01:09:24,029
and several colleagues of mine by the

1816
01:09:23,759 --> 01:09:26,639
way

1817
01:09:24,029 --> 01:09:28,770
Lindsey hariyali they all took a

1818
01:09:26,639 --> 01:09:30,329
financial hit over this they've all lost

1819
01:09:28,770 --> 01:09:31,619
some patreon support one of the

1820
01:09:30,329 --> 01:09:35,670
Lansing's former supporters even

1821
01:09:31,619 --> 01:09:38,279
demanded a $38 lifetime refund saying

1822
01:09:35,670 --> 01:09:40,529
dear Lindsey I'm sorry for being pushy

1823
01:09:38,279 --> 01:09:43,409
but I really am going to be needing a

1824
01:09:40,529 --> 01:09:45,329
refund I gave money to your operation

1825
01:09:43,409 --> 01:09:47,159
under the pretense that you wouldn't do

1826
01:09:45,329 --> 01:09:49,529
anything morally objectionable and

1827
01:09:47,159 --> 01:09:52,020
supporting contra points and blaming us

1828
01:09:49,529 --> 01:09:55,409
for taking issue with thought is in my

1829
01:09:52,020 --> 01:09:57,750
opinion a moral please respond I hope

1830
01:09:55,409 --> 01:10:00,150
she sent it to them in pennies so look

1831
01:09:57,750 --> 01:10:02,280
I'm very grateful to my colleagues for

1832
01:10:00,150 --> 01:10:05,579
sticking by me through all this but I'm

1833
01:10:02,280 --> 01:10:07,889
also aware that I'm becoming a burden to

1834
01:10:05,579 --> 01:10:09,869
anyone who associates with me I have no

1835
01:10:07,889 --> 01:10:12,389
collaborators in this video I'm working

1836
01:10:09,869 --> 01:10:15,179
on this totally alone because I'm aware

1837
01:10:12,389 --> 01:10:17,010
of how radioactive I am right now and I

1838
01:10:15,179 --> 01:10:18,960
don't want to contaminate anyone else

1839
01:10:17,010 --> 01:10:21,809
during the height of this most recent

1840
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:22,500
cancelling a creator I admire deemed me

1841
01:10:21,809 --> 01:10:24,420
to let me know

1842
01:10:22,500 --> 01:10:26,489
I cut the shout-out to you in my last

1843
01:10:24,420 --> 01:10:28,590
video because I was nervous to draw the

1844
01:10:26,489 --> 01:10:30,719
ire of your detractors were getting

1845
01:10:28,590 --> 01:10:33,179
genuinely scary but I wouldn't want you

1846
01:10:30,719 --> 01:10:36,420
to think I was disavow you regardless of

1847
01:10:33,179 --> 01:10:38,849
how many people are asking me to Jesus

1848
01:10:36,420 --> 01:10:40,860
Christ the situation here is that any

1849
01:10:38,849 --> 01:10:43,230
citizen who defends me or even

1850
01:10:40,860 --> 01:10:45,719
associates with me in any way will be

1851
01:10:43,230 --> 01:10:47,489
labeled a transfer any binary trans

1852
01:10:45,719 --> 01:10:50,099
person who associates with me will be

1853
01:10:47,489 --> 01:10:52,050
branded an MP phobe and any non-binary

1854
01:10:50,099 --> 01:10:54,329
people who associate with me will be

1855
01:10:52,050 --> 01:10:55,800
ostracized from their own community so

1856
01:10:54,329 --> 01:10:58,829
in the Internet I find myself

1857
01:10:55,800 --> 01:11:01,530
increasingly alone I'm isolated by the

1858
01:10:58,829 --> 01:11:04,079
harassment and that is ultimately the

1859
01:11:01,530 --> 01:11:05,880
point and to exile me from my community

1860
01:11:04,079 --> 01:11:07,650
from any community and it's all because

1861
01:11:05,880 --> 01:11:10,500
I refuse to participate and doing

1862
01:11:07,650 --> 01:11:12,270
exactly that to bug angel my experiences

1863
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:14,400
have made me so disillusioned with the

1864
01:11:12,270 --> 01:11:16,469
idea that social media call-outs can

1865
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:18,570
lead to any kind of justice that have

1866
01:11:16,469 --> 01:11:20,909
essentially sworn off participating

1867
01:11:18,570 --> 01:11:22,559
amount there's a fairly prominent figure

1868
01:11:20,909 --> 01:11:25,920
and leftist politics who I could

1869
01:11:22,559 --> 01:11:28,139
absolutely hashtag me to but I'm never

1870
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:30,510
gonna do it because I have no faith left

1871
01:11:28,139 --> 01:11:32,790
in the process of call out vigilante

1872
01:11:30,510 --> 01:11:34,500
justice and I'm not saying I'm totally

1873
01:11:32,790 --> 01:11:36,690
against me too

1874
01:11:34,500 --> 01:11:38,639
because I think in some cases it totally

1875
01:11:36,690 --> 01:11:41,159
is the brave and admirable thing to do

1876
01:11:38,639 --> 01:11:43,530
but in my case I feel like I just know

1877
01:11:41,159 --> 01:11:45,300
too much about the dark side of social

1878
01:11:43,530 --> 01:11:47,460
media shaming to ever want to

1879
01:11:45,300 --> 01:11:48,900
participate in it again you know I feel

1880
01:11:47,460 --> 01:11:51,510
like the story would end up being taken

1881
01:11:48,900 --> 01:11:53,550
out of my control warped and twisted in

1882
01:11:51,510 --> 01:11:55,530
all kinds of unpredictable ways that

1883
01:11:53,550 --> 01:11:58,139
would end up just haunting both me and

1884
01:11:55,530 --> 01:12:01,559
the person I'd be accusing which in this

1885
01:11:58,139 --> 01:12:03,630
case honestly neither of us deserves so

1886
01:12:01,559 --> 01:12:05,369
I'm just not willing to take that risk

1887
01:12:03,630 --> 01:12:08,190
except maybe in some very extreme

1888
01:12:05,369 --> 01:12:10,770
situation which this just isn't it's not

1889
01:12:08,190 --> 01:12:13,020
worth it and likewise when a mob is at

1890
01:12:10,770 --> 01:12:15,619
my doorstep demanding I condemn buck

1891
01:12:13,020 --> 01:12:19,170
angel to save myself from cancellation

1892
01:12:15,619 --> 01:12:21,780
no I'm just not gonna do that I'm a

1893
01:12:19,170 --> 01:12:23,699
conscientious objector I'm willing to go

1894
01:12:21,780 --> 01:12:26,150
to Twitter jail for this take me away

1895
01:12:23,699 --> 01:12:26,150
boys

1896
01:12:26,380 --> 01:12:34,639
[Music]

1897
01:12:29,439 --> 01:12:39,289
if there's one thing I can't stand it's

1898
01:12:34,639 --> 01:12:42,280
bread Tube videos part 8 now the

1899
01:12:39,289 --> 01:12:46,489
philosophy of being [ __ ] in the ass I

1900
01:12:42,280 --> 01:12:50,179
have done this to YouTube and I'm sorry

1901
01:12:46,489 --> 01:12:52,459
so look canceling is not criticism it is

1902
01:12:50,179 --> 01:12:54,979
not holding someone accountable it is an

1903
01:12:52,459 --> 01:12:57,319
attack on a human being in this video

1904
01:12:54,979 --> 01:12:59,599
are you Thord cancelling more or less

1905
01:12:57,319 --> 01:13:01,609
synonymously with what feminists show

1906
01:12:59,599 --> 01:13:04,609
freeman author of the [ __ ] manifesto

1907
01:13:01,609 --> 01:13:07,219
calls crashing and I've linked her essay

1908
01:13:04,609 --> 01:13:09,169
trashing the darkside of sisterhood and

1909
01:13:07,219 --> 01:13:12,499
the description it was originally

1910
01:13:09,169 --> 01:13:15,169
published in ms magazine in 1976 but it

1911
01:13:12,499 --> 01:13:17,359
is a perfect description of what goes on

1912
01:13:15,169 --> 01:13:19,579
on trans twitter today it is not

1913
01:13:17,359 --> 01:13:22,039
disagreement it is not conflict it is

1914
01:13:19,579 --> 01:13:24,530
not opposition these are perfectly

1915
01:13:22,039 --> 01:13:26,329
ordinary phenomena which when engaged in

1916
01:13:24,530 --> 01:13:28,579
mutually honestly and not excessively

1917
01:13:26,329 --> 01:13:31,969
are necessary to keep an organism or

1918
01:13:28,579 --> 01:13:34,129
organization healthy and active trashing

1919
01:13:31,969 --> 01:13:36,050
is a particularly vicious form of

1920
01:13:34,129 --> 01:13:38,389
character assassination which amounts to

1921
01:13:36,050 --> 01:13:40,879
psychological rape is manipulative

1922
01:13:38,389 --> 01:13:42,829
dishonest and excessive it is

1923
01:13:40,879 --> 01:13:45,379
occasionally disguised by the rhetoric

1924
01:13:42,829 --> 01:13:47,389
of honest conflict or covered up by

1925
01:13:45,379 --> 01:13:49,609
denying that any disapproval exists at

1926
01:13:47,389 --> 01:13:51,800
all but it is not done to expose

1927
01:13:49,609 --> 01:13:54,349
disagreements or resolve differences it

1928
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:56,809
is done to disparage and destroy

1929
01:13:54,349 --> 01:13:58,819
whatever methods are used trashing

1930
01:13:56,809 --> 01:14:01,129
involves a violation of one's integrity

1931
01:13:58,819 --> 01:14:03,859
a declaration of one's worthlessness and

1932
01:14:01,129 --> 01:14:06,559
impugning of one's motives in effect

1933
01:14:03,859 --> 01:14:10,489
what is attacked is not one's actions or

1934
01:14:06,559 --> 01:14:13,069
one's ideas but one's self and that's

1935
01:14:10,489 --> 01:14:15,739
what distinguishes trashing bullying or

1936
01:14:13,069 --> 01:14:17,899
abuse from criticism or holding

1937
01:14:15,739 --> 01:14:20,269
accountable criticism attacks your

1938
01:14:17,899 --> 01:14:22,669
actions or beliefs but when people are

1939
01:14:20,269 --> 01:14:24,559
canceling me they're not bringing up my

1940
01:14:22,669 --> 01:14:26,329
problematic tweets because they want me

1941
01:14:24,559 --> 01:14:29,030
to revise my beliefs

1942
01:14:26,329 --> 01:14:31,459
No what they're doing is accumulating

1943
01:14:29,030 --> 01:14:34,399
evidence to support the case they've

1944
01:14:31,459 --> 01:14:36,829
decided to make that I am a horrible

1945
01:14:34,399 --> 01:14:38,510
person who must be shunned you know the

1946
01:14:36,829 --> 01:14:41,120
only sense in which I am

1947
01:14:38,510 --> 01:14:43,820
like to say the new Blair White is that

1948
01:14:41,120 --> 01:14:46,520
I think I actually have now snatched a

1949
01:14:43,820 --> 01:14:49,850
Vanessa's crown as the most hated Tran

1950
01:14:46,520 --> 01:14:51,950
on Tran Twitter Vanessa I've tried to

1951
01:14:49,850 --> 01:14:53,870
feud with you feud with me goddamnit you

1952
01:14:51,950 --> 01:14:55,460
can have a one-sided feud I don't want

1953
01:14:53,870 --> 01:14:57,290
to be one of those trans youtubers that

1954
01:14:55,460 --> 01:14:59,420
just drags other trans people all day

1955
01:14:57,290 --> 01:15:01,730
and they never respond that would be

1956
01:14:59,420 --> 01:15:03,560
really pathetic the new Laci green

1957
01:15:01,730 --> 01:15:06,050
that's the other one the newest in a

1958
01:15:03,560 --> 01:15:08,240
series of women you've decided to treat

1959
01:15:06,050 --> 01:15:09,470
like supervillains maybe reflect on that

1960
01:15:08,240 --> 01:15:12,470
habit a little bit hmm

1961
01:15:09,470 --> 01:15:14,330
and supervillain is the right word like

1962
01:15:12,470 --> 01:15:17,750
I'm the bad guy

1963
01:15:14,330 --> 01:15:21,110
duh I'm the enemy and what you do with

1964
01:15:17,750 --> 01:15:23,540
the enemy well you disavow disowned deep

1965
01:15:21,110 --> 01:15:25,550
platform and destroy as that one tweet

1966
01:15:23,540 --> 01:15:27,560
put it dots the line in the sand folks

1967
01:15:25,550 --> 01:15:29,540
where do you stand

1968
01:15:27,560 --> 01:15:32,000
if you adequately demonstrate your

1969
01:15:29,540 --> 01:15:34,690
searing hatred of Natalie win then

1970
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:36,830
you're safe and cool but if you don't

1971
01:15:34,690 --> 01:15:39,950
you're on the wrong side of the line

1972
01:15:36,830 --> 01:15:44,330
sweaty and you two are now the enemy

1973
01:15:39,950 --> 01:15:47,030
Council culture troop 7 dualism certain

1974
01:15:44,330 --> 01:15:49,580
ancient religions teach their followers

1975
01:15:47,030 --> 01:15:52,280
to understand the cosmos as a struggle

1976
01:15:49,580 --> 01:15:54,590
between light and dark good and evil and

1977
01:15:52,280 --> 01:15:57,470
cancel culture does it more or less the

1978
01:15:54,590 --> 01:15:59,840
same thing it's binary thinking people

1979
01:15:57,470 --> 01:16:02,180
are either good or they're bad and to

1980
01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:04,670
add to that essentialism if a person

1981
01:16:02,180 --> 01:16:07,670
says or does a bad thing we should

1982
01:16:04,670 --> 01:16:09,500
interpret that as the mask slipping as a

1983
01:16:07,670 --> 01:16:11,450
momentary glimpse of their essential

1984
01:16:09,500 --> 01:16:14,030
wickedness and anyone who wants to

1985
01:16:11,450 --> 01:16:16,490
remain good had better be willing to

1986
01:16:14,030 --> 01:16:19,130
publicly condemn anyone the community

1987
01:16:16,490 --> 01:16:21,020
has decided is bad there really is

1988
01:16:19,130 --> 01:16:23,810
something dystopian about this you have

1989
01:16:21,020 --> 01:16:26,030
to be willing to accuse other people to

1990
01:16:23,810 --> 01:16:28,850
prove your own innocence that's the line

1991
01:16:26,030 --> 01:16:31,070
in the sand folks where do you stand and

1992
01:16:28,850 --> 01:16:33,860
the most extreme version of this all bad

1993
01:16:31,070 --> 01:16:35,540
people are equally bad so collaborating

1994
01:16:33,860 --> 01:16:38,600
with true scum means you may as well be

1995
01:16:35,540 --> 01:16:41,030
true scum and of course being true scum

1996
01:16:38,600 --> 01:16:43,490
is tantamount to being a turf and on

1997
01:16:41,030 --> 01:16:46,850
trans twitter it is a known fact that

1998
01:16:43,490 --> 01:16:50,210
turfs are Nazis and this implies that

1999
01:16:46,850 --> 01:16:52,310
Nazis turfs true scum people who

2000
01:16:50,210 --> 01:16:54,020
associate with true scum people who feel

2001
01:16:52,310 --> 01:16:55,820
to condemn people who associate with

2002
01:16:54,020 --> 01:16:57,800
true scum people who offer emotional

2003
01:16:55,820 --> 01:16:59,690
support to people who fail to condemn

2004
01:16:57,800 --> 01:17:02,000
people who associate with true scum all

2005
01:16:59,690 --> 01:17:04,430
of them must be treated the same way

2006
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:07,760
deep platform her just like every other

2007
01:17:04,430 --> 01:17:10,460
racist sexist bigoted content creator a

2008
01:17:07,760 --> 01:17:12,320
fully wound backhand to the mouth I

2009
01:17:10,460 --> 01:17:15,530
recently read a book by Sarah Schulman

2010
01:17:12,320 --> 01:17:17,720
called conflict is not abuse overstating

2011
01:17:15,530 --> 01:17:18,860
harm community responsibility and the

2012
01:17:17,720 --> 01:17:21,080
duty of repair

2013
01:17:18,860 --> 01:17:23,270
basically Shulman's argument is that in

2014
01:17:21,080 --> 01:17:26,240
various contexts from romantic

2015
01:17:23,270 --> 01:17:29,000
relationships to community infighting to

2016
01:17:26,240 --> 01:17:31,820
international politics the overstatement

2017
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:34,670
of harm is used as a justification for

2018
01:17:31,820 --> 01:17:36,980
cruelty and for escalating conflict so

2019
01:17:34,670 --> 01:17:39,650
for example and this is my example not

2020
01:17:36,980 --> 01:17:42,190
Shulman's turfs fixate on the

2021
01:17:39,650 --> 01:17:44,900
exaggerated danger that trans women

2022
01:17:42,190 --> 01:17:46,670
supposedly posed to assist women and in

2023
01:17:44,900 --> 01:17:48,650
very classic overstatement of harm

2024
01:17:46,670 --> 01:17:51,230
they'll describe everything they don't

2025
01:17:48,650 --> 01:17:53,570
like as a rape trans women entering

2026
01:17:51,230 --> 01:17:57,020
women's spaces is rape trans women

2027
01:17:53,570 --> 01:17:58,700
existing Janis Raymond is rape and then

2028
01:17:57,020 --> 01:18:01,820
they use that exaggerated harm as a

2029
01:17:58,700 --> 01:18:04,910
justification to retaliate against them

2030
01:18:01,820 --> 01:18:06,800
to Doc's and harass and shun well the

2031
01:18:04,910 --> 01:18:09,140
same kind of logic is used to justify

2032
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:11,510
abusive behavior within the trans

2033
01:18:09,140 --> 01:18:14,330
community the dualistic thinking the

2034
01:18:11,510 --> 01:18:16,550
essentialism the pseudo moralism all of

2035
01:18:14,330 --> 01:18:19,430
this allows people on Twitter to treat

2036
01:18:16,550 --> 01:18:21,740
me in an obviously abusive way all the

2037
01:18:19,430 --> 01:18:23,480
while feeling like they're doing the

2038
01:18:21,740 --> 01:18:25,880
right thing because they're attacking

2039
01:18:23,480 --> 01:18:27,260
the enemy and I realize that some people

2040
01:18:25,880 --> 01:18:29,990
will say that I'm the one who's

2041
01:18:27,260 --> 01:18:32,330
overstating harm to evade criticism well

2042
01:18:29,990 --> 01:18:34,850
look you've seen the tweets the furious

2043
01:18:32,330 --> 01:18:36,500
demands for me to be exiled the daxing

2044
01:18:34,850 --> 01:18:38,690
and threatening and ordering a round of

2045
01:18:36,500 --> 01:18:40,730
my colleagues the attempts to isolate me

2046
01:18:38,690 --> 01:18:42,560
from a community the attacks not on my

2047
01:18:40,730 --> 01:18:44,510
actions but on Who I am as a person

2048
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:47,150
there's not really anything ambiguous

2049
01:18:44,510 --> 01:18:49,250
about this it's just abuse but I don't

2050
01:18:47,150 --> 01:18:51,770
think it feels like abuse to the people

2051
01:18:49,250 --> 01:18:55,220
who are doing it they feel like they're

2052
01:18:51,770 --> 01:18:57,950
punching up because I must celebrity

2053
01:18:55,220 --> 01:19:00,230
with a platform and lots of twitter

2054
01:18:57,950 --> 01:19:02,320
followers and it's true that I do have

2055
01:19:00,230 --> 01:19:04,350
more power than any of them individually

2056
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:06,780
but as a

2057
01:19:04,350 --> 01:19:09,000
elective they have a terrifying power

2058
01:19:06,780 --> 01:19:12,030
that they don't seem to be aware of as

2059
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:13,950
individuals as John Watson author of a

2060
01:19:12,030 --> 01:19:15,840
great book on public shaming put it I

2061
01:19:13,950 --> 01:19:17,670
suppose that when shaming czar delivered

2062
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:19,560
like remotely administers drone strikes

2063
01:19:17,670 --> 01:19:21,300
nobody needs to think about how

2064
01:19:19,560 --> 01:19:23,880
ferocious our collective power might be

2065
01:19:21,300 --> 01:19:26,220
the snowflake never needs to feel

2066
01:19:23,880 --> 01:19:28,320
responsible for the Avalanche and that's

2067
01:19:26,220 --> 01:19:30,060
how you get these situations where you

2068
01:19:28,320 --> 01:19:32,280
have hundreds of people endlessly

2069
01:19:30,060 --> 01:19:34,380
bashing someone who's already been

2070
01:19:32,280 --> 01:19:36,720
knocked to the ground and feeling all

2071
01:19:34,380 --> 01:19:38,640
the while like they're punching up you

2072
01:19:36,720 --> 01:19:41,430
know there's actually a kind of power

2073
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:43,680
and safety in anonymity and obscurity

2074
01:19:41,430 --> 01:19:45,720
and there are many ways that being a

2075
01:19:43,680 --> 01:19:47,760
public figure makes you really

2076
01:19:45,720 --> 01:19:50,010
vulnerable for example you're more

2077
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:53,040
vulnerable to daxing stalking and

2078
01:19:50,010 --> 01:19:55,170
harassment on a scale that most people

2079
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:57,150
probably can't even imagine you're

2080
01:19:55,170 --> 01:20:00,060
vulnerable to having your reputation

2081
01:19:57,150 --> 01:20:02,100
permanently degraded in a way that

2082
01:20:00,060 --> 01:20:03,930
people who are posting anonymously or

2083
01:20:02,100 --> 01:20:05,880
pseudonymous lee are pretty much in

2084
01:20:03,930 --> 01:20:08,220
venerable - and a lot of the people who

2085
01:20:05,880 --> 01:20:09,180
are attacking me they're not pausing to

2086
01:20:08,220 --> 01:20:10,410
self-reflect

2087
01:20:09,180 --> 01:20:12,360
they're not holding themselves

2088
01:20:10,410 --> 01:20:14,520
accountable for the consequences of

2089
01:20:12,360 --> 01:20:17,250
their actions they're just venting their

2090
01:20:14,520 --> 01:20:20,670
unfiltered rage but in response to these

2091
01:20:17,250 --> 01:20:23,400
attacks I as a powerful person with a

2092
01:20:20,670 --> 01:20:25,890
platform I'm not allowed to react like a

2093
01:20:23,400 --> 01:20:28,140
human being I'm not allowed to get angry

2094
01:20:25,890 --> 01:20:29,880
I'm not allowed to show pain I'm not

2095
01:20:28,140 --> 01:20:32,460
allowed to get defensive I'm not allowed

2096
01:20:29,880 --> 01:20:34,980
to lash out all I'm allowed to do is go

2097
01:20:32,460 --> 01:20:37,740
totally nama the inside as I try to

2098
01:20:34,980 --> 01:20:40,020
frantically calculate the ideal public

2099
01:20:37,740 --> 01:20:42,210
relations response that pays due

2100
01:20:40,020 --> 01:20:44,580
deference to the valid concerns of these

2101
01:20:42,210 --> 01:20:47,220
poor marginalized people all the while

2102
01:20:44,580 --> 01:20:50,160
ignoring the tsunami of verbal abuse

2103
01:20:47,220 --> 01:20:52,590
that's crashing over me you know people

2104
01:20:50,160 --> 01:20:54,870
on Twitter they don't try to persuade me

2105
01:20:52,590 --> 01:20:57,360
like I'm a human being they order me

2106
01:20:54,870 --> 01:20:59,820
around they tell me what to believe they

2107
01:20:57,360 --> 01:21:02,370
demand that I say exactly what they want

2108
01:20:59,820 --> 01:21:04,680
me to say or else it's extremely

2109
01:21:02,370 --> 01:21:06,840
objectifying they don't treat me like a

2110
01:21:04,680 --> 01:21:10,020
person with my own opinions and feelings

2111
01:21:06,840 --> 01:21:12,570
they treat me as this like brand of

2112
01:21:10,020 --> 01:21:14,460
moral commodity to be consumed or

2113
01:21:12,570 --> 01:21:17,110
denounced and this is all terribly

2114
01:21:14,460 --> 01:21:20,260
ironic because of the conflicting demand

2115
01:21:17,110 --> 01:21:22,030
that creators be authentic all the time

2116
01:21:20,260 --> 01:21:24,400
one thing that always frustrates me

2117
01:21:22,030 --> 01:21:27,340
about these situations is there's this

2118
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:30,100
demand that you apologize instantly and

2119
01:21:27,340 --> 01:21:32,320
there's this perception that a fast

2120
01:21:30,100 --> 01:21:35,320
apology is more sincere than a delayed

2121
01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:37,510
one but in fact the opposite is true it

2122
01:21:35,320 --> 01:21:41,020
takes longer than a couple hours to cool

2123
01:21:37,510 --> 01:21:44,380
down lower your defenses listen learn

2124
01:21:41,020 --> 01:21:46,120
grow seriously reflect on what you may

2125
01:21:44,380 --> 01:21:50,080
have done or said that was wrong that

2126
01:21:46,120 --> 01:21:52,480
can take days or weeks or months I had

2127
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:54,550
to do my October am a stream for patreon

2128
01:21:52,480 --> 01:21:57,910
and at the beginning of the stream I

2129
01:21:54,550 --> 01:22:01,030
gave my emotional half formed reaction

2130
01:21:57,910 --> 01:22:06,820
to the buck angel situation and some

2131
01:22:01,030 --> 01:22:09,010
traitor on my patreon transcribed that

2132
01:22:06,820 --> 01:22:10,900
part of the stream and disseminated it

2133
01:22:09,010 --> 01:22:12,490
on Twitter just to instigate another

2134
01:22:10,900 --> 01:22:15,660
round of canceling you're not allowed a

2135
01:22:12,490 --> 01:22:17,980
chance to think or feel and because

2136
01:22:15,660 --> 01:22:19,600
supposedly the best thing to do from a

2137
01:22:17,980 --> 01:22:22,540
PR perspective is to apologize

2138
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:25,840
immediately canceling produces a lot of

2139
01:22:22,540 --> 01:22:28,450
insincere [ __ ] apologies from people

2140
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:30,580
who haven't in fact learned anything and

2141
01:22:28,450 --> 01:22:32,680
I think most people are aware of that in

2142
01:22:30,580 --> 01:22:35,770
fact I think the demand for an apology

2143
01:22:32,680 --> 01:22:36,760
itself is often insincere if you're

2144
01:22:35,770 --> 01:22:39,820
being canceled

2145
01:22:36,760 --> 01:22:42,550
rather than criticized the line in the

2146
01:22:39,820 --> 01:22:45,790
sand has been drawn you and all your kin

2147
01:22:42,550 --> 01:22:48,040
have been declared the enemy apologized

2148
01:22:45,790 --> 01:22:49,750
to Twitter at this point I may as well

2149
01:22:48,040 --> 01:22:53,170
apologize too for camp

2150
01:22:49,750 --> 01:22:55,210
dear 4chan I am super [ __ ] sorry I

2151
01:22:53,170 --> 01:22:57,070
called youth interested otaku

2152
01:22:55,210 --> 01:22:58,960
shitweasels who like looking at pictures

2153
01:22:57,070 --> 01:23:00,700
of little girls I have been trying to

2154
01:22:58,960 --> 01:23:03,010
educate myself and learn from my

2155
01:23:00,700 --> 01:23:05,080
mistakes and I now realize that's only

2156
01:23:03,010 --> 01:23:07,540
seventy percent of you like once you're

2157
01:23:05,080 --> 01:23:09,730
canceled you can really do no right if

2158
01:23:07,540 --> 01:23:12,010
you apologize the apology will be

2159
01:23:09,730 --> 01:23:14,050
declared a manipulative attempt to save

2160
01:23:12,010 --> 01:23:16,500
face and in fact it will be used as

2161
01:23:14,050 --> 01:23:19,030
further evidence of what a Machiavellian

2162
01:23:16,500 --> 01:23:21,250
psychopath you really are if you try to

2163
01:23:19,030 --> 01:23:23,350
explain or defend yourself I mean first

2164
01:23:21,250 --> 01:23:25,450
of all you almost certainly dig yourself

2165
01:23:23,350 --> 01:23:27,730
in deeper but even if you're articulate

2166
01:23:25,450 --> 01:23:29,020
and correct you'll still be seen as

2167
01:23:27,730 --> 01:23:31,270
unable to take criticize

2168
01:23:29,020 --> 01:23:33,730
and as ignoring the hurt of marginalized

2169
01:23:31,270 --> 01:23:35,500
people and if he just goes silent you'll

2170
01:23:33,730 --> 01:23:37,240
be seen as a coward fleeing

2171
01:23:35,500 --> 01:23:40,330
accountability even though there's lots

2172
01:23:37,240 --> 01:23:41,590
of reasons why you might go silent maybe

2173
01:23:40,330 --> 01:23:43,780
you're taking a few days away from

2174
01:23:41,590 --> 01:23:46,210
social media to try to cool down and

2175
01:23:43,780 --> 01:23:47,920
think clearly or maybe you're so

2176
01:23:46,210 --> 01:23:56,050
overwhelmed by the harassment that

2177
01:23:47,920 --> 01:23:58,300
you've just shut down let's do shots

2178
01:23:56,050 --> 01:24:01,270
wants to do a shot with me don't you to

2179
01:23:58,300 --> 01:24:03,660
shot with me let's do a shot tequila

2180
01:24:01,270 --> 01:24:07,660
shot is my favorite I like the whole

2181
01:24:03,660 --> 01:24:12,150
salt tequila-lime ritual it's just very

2182
01:24:07,660 --> 01:24:13,660
satisfying to me the end of that bottle

2183
01:24:12,150 --> 01:24:22,570
okay

2184
01:24:13,660 --> 01:24:25,900
just started you feel warm right away

2185
01:24:22,570 --> 01:24:28,840
you know feeling more it's like oh hey

2186
01:24:25,900 --> 01:24:31,210
how are you happiness hey how are you

2187
01:24:28,840 --> 01:24:33,310
feeling that life is worth to living

2188
01:24:31,210 --> 01:24:35,320
it's a good moment you're like oh this

2189
01:24:33,310 --> 01:24:37,360
isn't okay this is gonna be okay I can

2190
01:24:35,320 --> 01:24:39,670
get through this it's how it starts to

2191
01:24:37,360 --> 01:24:41,260
watch out for that so look I really

2192
01:24:39,670 --> 01:24:44,650
don't like to represent myself as a

2193
01:24:41,260 --> 01:24:47,320
victim that's not really a narrative

2194
01:24:44,650 --> 01:24:49,270
that I identify with but for the

2195
01:24:47,320 --> 01:24:51,910
purposes of communicating what effect

2196
01:24:49,270 --> 01:24:55,360
cancelling has I feel like I should say

2197
01:24:51,910 --> 01:24:57,670
something about the pain much of the

2198
01:24:55,360 --> 01:25:00,670
happiness that you might expect to come

2199
01:24:57,670 --> 01:25:04,390
along with success has been taken away

2200
01:25:00,670 --> 01:25:06,190
from me by this constant fury that

2201
01:25:04,390 --> 01:25:08,920
surrounds me try to think about this

2202
01:25:06,190 --> 01:25:11,380
rationally I'm a Libra Sun ycs Moon

2203
01:25:08,920 --> 01:25:15,910
being cancelled is hell for me you know

2204
01:25:11,380 --> 01:25:17,920
I want to be liked by everyone and I'm

2205
01:25:15,910 --> 01:25:20,740
starting to think I might be in the

2206
01:25:17,920 --> 01:25:23,050
wrong career for that in a way leftist

2207
01:25:20,740 --> 01:25:24,910
twitter finally accomplished with 4chan

2208
01:25:23,050 --> 01:25:26,980
Nazis stalkers and turf's

2209
01:25:24,910 --> 01:25:29,410
have been trying and failing to do to me

2210
01:25:26,980 --> 01:25:32,590
for years they've made Twitter into a

2211
01:25:29,410 --> 01:25:34,270
platform so hostile to my existence that

2212
01:25:32,590 --> 01:25:36,640
I've decided to leave it forever and

2213
01:25:34,270 --> 01:25:38,620
they demoralized me to the point I could

2214
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:39,670
barely get out of bed for a month

2215
01:25:38,620 --> 01:25:42,070
and I know that sounds really

2216
01:25:39,670 --> 01:25:44,530
melodramatic but I'm just trying to be

2217
01:25:42,070 --> 01:25:46,570
honest with you about what a

2218
01:25:44,530 --> 01:25:48,460
melodramatic courtesan I am I find I

2219
01:25:46,570 --> 01:25:50,170
have trouble convincing people of the

2220
01:25:48,460 --> 01:25:52,900
severity of the pain that being

2221
01:25:50,170 --> 01:25:54,940
cancelled causes because I think it's

2222
01:25:52,900 --> 01:25:56,650
just hard to imagine if you haven't been

2223
01:25:54,940 --> 01:25:58,570
through it yourself and I don't know a

2224
01:25:56,650 --> 01:26:01,720
more succinct way to convey it to you

2225
01:25:58,570 --> 01:26:03,430
than by telling you that in the last few

2226
01:26:01,720 --> 01:26:05,770
years I've been harassed by Nazis I've

2227
01:26:03,430 --> 01:26:07,540
been harassed by turfs I've been stopped

2228
01:26:05,770 --> 01:26:09,880
I've been doxxed I've been threatened

2229
01:26:07,540 --> 01:26:12,490
I've been sexually assaulted and the

2230
01:26:09,880 --> 01:26:14,710
pain of being canceled of being totally

2231
01:26:12,490 --> 01:26:17,260
trashed by other trans people online for

2232
01:26:14,710 --> 01:26:18,580
years has been more difficult for me to

2233
01:26:17,260 --> 01:26:20,590
cope with than all the rest of it

2234
01:26:18,580 --> 01:26:22,600
combined Joe Freeman actually describes

2235
01:26:20,590 --> 01:26:23,950
how I feel better than I think I can

2236
01:26:22,600 --> 01:26:25,420
describe it myself

2237
01:26:23,950 --> 01:26:28,120
I was one of the first in the country

2238
01:26:25,420 --> 01:26:30,670
perhaps the first in Chicago to have my

2239
01:26:28,120 --> 01:26:32,860
character my commitment and my very self

2240
01:26:30,670 --> 01:26:34,780
at out in such a way by movement women

2241
01:26:32,860 --> 01:26:36,760
that have left me torn and little pieces

2242
01:26:34,780 --> 01:26:38,830
and unable to function it took me years

2243
01:26:36,760 --> 01:26:40,780
to recover and even today the wounds

2244
01:26:38,830 --> 01:26:42,760
have not entirely healed this attack is

2245
01:26:40,780 --> 01:26:45,400
accomplished by making you feel that

2246
01:26:42,760 --> 01:26:46,930
your very existence is inimical to the

2247
01:26:45,400 --> 01:26:49,570
movement and that nothing can change

2248
01:26:46,930 --> 01:26:51,010
this short of ceasing to exist these

2249
01:26:49,570 --> 01:26:53,170
feelings are reinforced when you are

2250
01:26:51,010 --> 01:26:55,120
isolated from your friends as they

2251
01:26:53,170 --> 01:26:57,190
become convinced that their association

2252
01:26:55,120 --> 01:26:59,590
with you is similarly animal to the

2253
01:26:57,190 --> 01:27:01,870
movement and to themselves any support

2254
01:26:59,590 --> 01:27:04,090
of you will taint them eventually all

2255
01:27:01,870 --> 01:27:06,160
your colleagues join in in a chorus of

2256
01:27:04,090 --> 01:27:08,320
condemnation which cannot be silenced

2257
01:27:06,160 --> 01:27:11,470
and you are reduced to a mere parody of

2258
01:27:08,320 --> 01:27:14,260
your previous self yeah that just about

2259
01:27:11,470 --> 01:27:16,810
sums it up now as it happens I am going

2260
01:27:14,260 --> 01:27:18,970
to survive this because I have very

2261
01:27:16,810 --> 01:27:21,520
deliberately built a support network

2262
01:27:18,970 --> 01:27:24,040
that will be there for me regardless of

2263
01:27:21,520 --> 01:27:26,110
what online trans communities say and I

2264
01:27:24,040 --> 01:27:29,160
have very deliberately done that because

2265
01:27:26,110 --> 01:27:31,870
early in my transition back in 2017 I

2266
01:27:29,160 --> 01:27:34,540
relied very heavily on the online

2267
01:27:31,870 --> 01:27:36,040
leftist trans community for all kinds of

2268
01:27:34,540 --> 01:27:38,950
emotional support you know when you're

2269
01:27:36,040 --> 01:27:41,320
early in transition I mean it just sucks

2270
01:27:38,950 --> 01:27:42,910
you feel like the whole world is against

2271
01:27:41,320 --> 01:27:44,890
you and I talk about this a little bit

2272
01:27:42,910 --> 01:27:46,720
in my last video you know feeling like a

2273
01:27:44,890 --> 01:27:48,400
freak show walking down the street and

2274
01:27:46,720 --> 01:27:50,080
even if you're lucky enough to have a

2275
01:27:48,400 --> 01:27:51,580
supportive family like

2276
01:27:50,080 --> 01:27:53,470
usually it still is gonna take them a

2277
01:27:51,580 --> 01:27:55,180
while to come around at first they don't

2278
01:27:53,470 --> 01:27:56,950
got it they say things to you like

2279
01:27:55,180 --> 01:27:59,050
aren't you worried you'll regret this

2280
01:27:56,950 --> 01:28:01,150
and like they struggle with your name

2281
01:27:59,050 --> 01:28:03,520
and pronouns which is understandable but

2282
01:28:01,150 --> 01:28:05,470
at the same time it makes you feel like

2283
01:28:03,520 --> 01:28:07,660
you're not being seen for who you are so

2284
01:28:05,470 --> 01:28:09,790
you need a kind of second family that

2285
01:28:07,660 --> 01:28:11,650
understands how you're feeling and acts

2286
01:28:09,790 --> 01:28:13,600
happy about your transition and

2287
01:28:11,650 --> 01:28:15,880
validates your gender and for the first

2288
01:28:13,600 --> 01:28:18,580
couple months of my transition I found

2289
01:28:15,880 --> 01:28:20,380
that in this world of online transgender

2290
01:28:18,580 --> 01:28:23,200
leftism well that didn't last long

2291
01:28:20,380 --> 01:28:25,450
because well I was what two months into

2292
01:28:23,200 --> 01:28:27,010
my transition when first I did an

2293
01:28:25,450 --> 01:28:29,170
interview with the journal is Jesse

2294
01:28:27,010 --> 01:28:31,240
single and then I agreed to do a debate

2295
01:28:29,170 --> 01:28:33,910
with Theron and Vanessa so that's a long

2296
01:28:31,240 --> 01:28:35,530
story but in short I associated with a

2297
01:28:33,910 --> 01:28:37,990
string of people that trans Twitter

2298
01:28:35,530 --> 01:28:40,090
considers the enemy and Trent's Twitter

2299
01:28:37,990 --> 01:28:42,600
tore me apart over this and it

2300
01:28:40,090 --> 01:28:46,870
completely broke my heart because I was

2301
01:28:42,600 --> 01:28:49,150
really leaning on basically emotional

2302
01:28:46,870 --> 01:28:51,250
support from strangers online seems

2303
01:28:49,150 --> 01:28:53,680
really stupid in retrospect and actually

2304
01:28:51,250 --> 01:28:55,000
turned against me I decided one that I

2305
01:28:53,680 --> 01:28:57,610
was never going to rely on this group of

2306
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:59,560
people again and two that I was going to

2307
01:28:57,610 --> 01:29:01,000
have to find acceptance elsewhere and in

2308
01:28:59,560 --> 01:29:02,530
retrospect I think this actually may

2309
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:04,840
have been good for me in a roundabout

2310
01:29:02,530 --> 01:29:07,240
way because I was kicked out of the safe

2311
01:29:04,840 --> 01:29:08,950
space and I dropped out mentality and so

2312
01:29:07,240 --> 01:29:10,750
basically I was thrown into the deep end

2313
01:29:08,950 --> 01:29:13,330
of reality and forced to sink or swim

2314
01:29:10,750 --> 01:29:15,160
and I don't know if my transition or my

2315
01:29:13,330 --> 01:29:16,480
channel would be where they are today if

2316
01:29:15,160 --> 01:29:18,790
it hadn't been for that trial by fire

2317
01:29:16,480 --> 01:29:19,840
I'll be swimming through fire or are we

2318
01:29:18,790 --> 01:29:23,140
mixing metaphors

2319
01:29:19,840 --> 01:29:25,540
the point is I'm more armored against

2320
01:29:23,140 --> 01:29:27,640
cancelling than I was two years ago and

2321
01:29:25,540 --> 01:29:29,770
the reason why is I have acquired a

2322
01:29:27,640 --> 01:29:31,510
certain level of privilege and security

2323
01:29:29,770 --> 01:29:34,150
and independence from any one community

2324
01:29:31,510 --> 01:29:36,460
so that if one community cancels me I

2325
01:29:34,150 --> 01:29:37,960
still have somewhere else to go you know

2326
01:29:36,460 --> 01:29:39,850
the people who are most vulnerable to

2327
01:29:37,960 --> 01:29:41,710
cancel culture are not white guy

2328
01:29:39,850 --> 01:29:44,050
comedians they're not James Charles

2329
01:29:41,710 --> 01:29:45,610
they're not me they are marginalized

2330
01:29:44,050 --> 01:29:47,110
people who feel like they have nowhere

2331
01:29:45,610 --> 01:29:49,630
else to go when they're rejected by

2332
01:29:47,110 --> 01:29:51,280
their community that means struggling

2333
01:29:49,630 --> 01:29:53,470
trans people with a few hundred Twitter

2334
01:29:51,280 --> 01:29:55,840
followers it means a lot of sex workers

2335
01:29:53,470 --> 01:29:58,330
it means people who totally rely on

2336
01:29:55,840 --> 01:30:00,520
activist circles for emotional and

2337
01:29:58,330 --> 01:30:01,329
material support I'll quote Roe Freeman

2338
01:30:00,520 --> 01:30:03,399
one more time

2339
01:30:01,329 --> 01:30:05,169
I had survived my youth because I had

2340
01:30:03,399 --> 01:30:06,879
never given anyone or any group the

2341
01:30:05,169 --> 01:30:08,769
right to judge me that right

2342
01:30:06,879 --> 01:30:11,199
I had reserved to myself but the

2343
01:30:08,769 --> 01:30:13,539
movement seduced me by its sweet

2344
01:30:11,199 --> 01:30:15,399
promises sisterhood it claimed to

2345
01:30:13,539 --> 01:30:17,799
provide a haven from the ravages of a

2346
01:30:15,399 --> 01:30:20,199
sexist society a place where one would

2347
01:30:17,799 --> 01:30:22,239
be understood it was my very need for

2348
01:30:20,199 --> 01:30:24,849
feminism and feminists that made me

2349
01:30:22,239 --> 01:30:27,369
vulnerable I gave the movement the right

2350
01:30:24,849 --> 01:30:29,979
to judge me because I trusted it and

2351
01:30:27,369 --> 01:30:31,959
when it judged me worthless I accepted

2352
01:30:29,979 --> 01:30:33,999
that judgment there's a really

2353
01:30:31,959 --> 01:30:36,309
irritating point that people on the Left

2354
01:30:33,999 --> 01:30:37,689
like to make that goes well cancelling

2355
01:30:36,309 --> 01:30:40,029
doesn't really end anyone's career

2356
01:30:37,689 --> 01:30:42,519
cancelled people usually get a new job

2357
01:30:40,029 --> 01:30:44,019
or keep their platform so I guess it's

2358
01:30:42,519 --> 01:30:46,059
not really that bad huh

2359
01:30:44,019 --> 01:30:47,949
I think people say this because they're

2360
01:30:46,059 --> 01:30:49,329
trying to mitigate any sense of guilt

2361
01:30:47,949 --> 01:30:50,889
they might feel about how they're

2362
01:30:49,329 --> 01:30:52,869
treating people because it's a really

2363
01:30:50,889 --> 01:30:54,579
stupid argument there's lots of things

2364
01:30:52,869 --> 01:30:56,859
that don't end your life they're still

2365
01:30:54,579 --> 01:30:59,019
terrible but also there's cases where

2366
01:30:56,859 --> 01:31:02,169
cancelling has ended someone's life on

2367
01:30:59,019 --> 01:31:04,419
December 5th 2017 a porn star named -

2368
01:31:02,169 --> 01:31:07,299
August Eames killed herself by hanging

2369
01:31:04,419 --> 01:31:09,099
in a public park after being cancelled

2370
01:31:07,299 --> 01:31:11,589
on Twitter over a homophobic tweet on

2371
01:31:09,099 --> 01:31:13,359
December 3rd she tweeted whichever lady

2372
01:31:11,589 --> 01:31:15,399
performer is replacing me tomorrow for

2373
01:31:13,359 --> 01:31:17,379
erotica acts News you're shooting with a

2374
01:31:15,399 --> 01:31:19,149
guy who was shot gay porn just to let

2375
01:31:17,379 --> 01:31:21,249
you know BS is all I can say

2376
01:31:19,149 --> 01:31:23,049
shrug do agents really not care about

2377
01:31:21,249 --> 01:31:25,629
who they're representing la Direct I do

2378
01:31:23,049 --> 01:31:27,849
my homework for my body so I've never

2379
01:31:25,629 --> 01:31:30,010
worked in porn so I can't really tell

2380
01:31:27,849 --> 01:31:32,229
you what the norms are around women

2381
01:31:30,010 --> 01:31:33,429
working with men who have done gay porn

2382
01:31:32,229 --> 01:31:35,319
but the tweet

2383
01:31:33,429 --> 01:31:36,969
certainly sounds homophobic to me and

2384
01:31:35,319 --> 01:31:38,859
that seems to be the consensus of other

2385
01:31:36,969 --> 01:31:40,749
industry people on Twitter so Twitter

2386
01:31:38,859 --> 01:31:42,399
did his thing people in August's

2387
01:31:40,749 --> 01:31:44,649
community called her a homophobe and

2388
01:31:42,399 --> 01:31:46,929
lashed out at her and as always happens

2389
01:31:44,649 --> 01:31:48,969
plenty of passers-by jumped in to throw

2390
01:31:46,929 --> 01:31:51,010
tomatoes at the woman in the stocks over

2391
01:31:48,969 --> 01:31:52,599
the next few days August tweeted several

2392
01:31:51,010 --> 01:31:54,159
more times going through the usual

2393
01:31:52,599 --> 01:31:56,229
stages that you go through when you're

2394
01:31:54,159 --> 01:31:58,719
being canceled first she defended

2395
01:31:56,229 --> 01:32:00,399
herself she claimed most other women in

2396
01:31:58,719 --> 01:32:02,109
the industry feel the same as her then

2397
01:32:00,399 --> 01:32:03,819
she said she's bisexual and therefore

2398
01:32:02,109 --> 01:32:05,649
she couldn't be homophobic then she said

2399
01:32:03,819 --> 01:32:07,299
fine I'll guess I'll be fake and I have

2400
01:32:05,649 --> 01:32:09,039
opinions then then she started by

2401
01:32:07,299 --> 01:32:09,729
moaning how mean twitter is and she got

2402
01:32:09,039 --> 01:32:11,679
really defended

2403
01:32:09,729 --> 01:32:13,539
about her right to choose who she sucks

2404
01:32:11,679 --> 01:32:16,150
with and she latched out of the people

2405
01:32:13,539 --> 01:32:18,940
attacking her and then in her final

2406
01:32:16,150 --> 01:32:20,559
tweet she just said [ __ ] y'all and went

2407
01:32:18,940 --> 01:32:23,110
to the park that night and killed

2408
01:32:20,559 --> 01:32:24,820
herself this is all so familiar to me I

2409
01:32:23,110 --> 01:32:26,979
feel like I'm able to relive with her

2410
01:32:24,820 --> 01:32:28,570
each stage of this emotional process

2411
01:32:26,979 --> 01:32:30,309
there's that first moment when you

2412
01:32:28,570 --> 01:32:32,499
realize the outrage is beginning and you

2413
01:32:30,309 --> 01:32:35,320
get that sinking feeling in your stomach

2414
01:32:32,499 --> 01:32:38,019
and an anger feeling misunderstood and

2415
01:32:35,320 --> 01:32:40,360
then the bargaining the fear and finally

2416
01:32:38,019 --> 01:32:42,789
the shame and the despair and here's the

2417
01:32:40,360 --> 01:32:45,010
thing I totally agree with her critics

2418
01:32:42,789 --> 01:32:46,809
that her tweet was bad of course she has

2419
01:32:45,010 --> 01:32:49,570
the right to say no for any reason but

2420
01:32:46,809 --> 01:32:52,269
she publicly expressed this in a

2421
01:32:49,570 --> 01:32:54,820
homophobic way but she was still a

2422
01:32:52,269 --> 01:32:56,229
person who deserves to live and I think

2423
01:32:54,820 --> 01:32:58,690
there's got to be a better way to deal

2424
01:32:56,229 --> 01:33:00,789
with these situations than just trashing

2425
01:32:58,690 --> 01:33:02,409
someone until they kill themselves and I

2426
01:33:00,789 --> 01:33:04,300
know it's never as simple as Twitter

2427
01:33:02,409 --> 01:33:05,709
made her kill herself there's always

2428
01:33:04,300 --> 01:33:08,380
other things going on in the background

2429
01:33:05,709 --> 01:33:10,510
but the point I'm making is cancelling

2430
01:33:08,380 --> 01:33:12,880
is more dangerous to marginalized people

2431
01:33:10,510 --> 01:33:14,650
because marginalized people generally

2432
01:33:12,880 --> 01:33:16,539
have more things going on in the

2433
01:33:14,650 --> 01:33:18,519
background John Watson did an

2434
01:33:16,539 --> 01:33:20,559
investigative podcast about her death

2435
01:33:18,519 --> 01:33:22,780
and it goes into how she was sexually

2436
01:33:20,559 --> 01:33:24,459
abused as a child abandoned by her

2437
01:33:22,780 --> 01:33:26,260
father she was living with a boyfriend

2438
01:33:24,459 --> 01:33:28,360
she was kind of emotionally detached

2439
01:33:26,260 --> 01:33:30,190
from it a few weeks earlier she'd filmed

2440
01:33:28,360 --> 01:33:32,949
a scene with a guy who was unnecessarily

2441
01:33:30,190 --> 01:33:34,719
rough and mean and who mistreated her so

2442
01:33:32,949 --> 01:33:37,209
she was kind of traumatized by that and

2443
01:33:34,719 --> 01:33:39,309
so she was kind of on edge and really

2444
01:33:37,209 --> 01:33:40,809
defensive about who she worked with when

2445
01:33:39,309 --> 01:33:43,179
she was tweeting that the backlash

2446
01:33:40,809 --> 01:33:45,760
happened and since she had no other

2447
01:33:43,179 --> 01:33:47,469
support network she probably felt like

2448
01:33:45,760 --> 01:33:49,539
the only community she had turned

2449
01:33:47,469 --> 01:33:53,139
against her and that's a really painful

2450
01:33:49,539 --> 01:33:55,749
feeling she must have felt so despised

2451
01:33:53,139 --> 01:33:58,949
which is how I have felt for the last

2452
01:33:55,749 --> 01:34:01,719
two months I feel despised and

2453
01:33:58,949 --> 01:34:04,150
burdensome and I can imagine how a

2454
01:34:01,719 --> 01:34:06,159
person who feels that way could have an

2455
01:34:04,150 --> 01:34:08,289
impulsive couple hours where they think

2456
01:34:06,159 --> 01:34:09,670
their best option is suicide I mean I

2457
01:34:08,289 --> 01:34:12,010
can more than imagine it because I've

2458
01:34:09,670 --> 01:34:13,989
been there myself and I'm still here

2459
01:34:12,010 --> 01:34:16,630
because at those moments I've been with

2460
01:34:13,989 --> 01:34:20,050
good friends who took care of me and by

2461
01:34:16,630 --> 01:34:22,550
friends I do mean xanax

2462
01:34:20,050 --> 01:34:23,989
but I've also survived because there's a

2463
01:34:22,550 --> 01:34:26,090
lot of people on the internet who me

2464
01:34:23,989 --> 01:34:28,100
very entertained if I killed myself and

2465
01:34:26,090 --> 01:34:30,560
I simply refused to give them the

2466
01:34:28,100 --> 01:34:32,210
satisfaction oh no [ __ ] find chess to

2467
01:34:30,560 --> 01:34:33,230
live as long as far as what of sheer

2468
01:34:32,210 --> 01:34:34,969
spite

2469
01:34:33,230 --> 01:34:36,590
I mean who needs a guardian angel when

2470
01:34:34,969 --> 01:34:38,929
you can make it through Christmas after

2471
01:34:36,590 --> 01:34:41,090
Christmas on the fumes of total contempt

2472
01:34:38,929 --> 01:34:45,580
what I'm really trying to say is Merry

2473
01:34:41,090 --> 01:34:45,580
Christmas you god damn [ __ ]

2474
01:34:53,989 --> 01:35:17,410

a comment if you want a bathtub alright

2483
01:35:38,300 --> 01:35:42,380
I need to take a deep breath because

2484
01:35:40,190 --> 01:35:44,270
let's be honest I've got one crack away

2485
01:35:42,380 --> 01:35:46,100
from attacking my own Twitter followers

2486
01:35:44,270 --> 01:35:48,440
with an umbrella I had about one

2487
01:35:46,100 --> 01:35:50,900
breakdown away from going on a rampage

2488
01:35:48,440 --> 01:35:52,520
and making a suit out of women's skin

2489
01:35:50,900 --> 01:35:54,170
just kidding I would never do that

2490
01:35:52,520 --> 01:35:57,530
there on a bad skin day I've given it

2491
01:35:54,170 --> 01:35:59,450
serious consideration oh I'll be fine

2492
01:35:57,530 --> 01:36:01,370
I've gotta sober up anyway because I'm

2493
01:35:59,450 --> 01:36:04,070
having more plastic surgery in a couple

2494
01:36:01,370 --> 01:36:05,420
days and plastic surgery that's about

2495
01:36:04,070 --> 01:36:06,050
the only thing holding me together at

2496
01:36:05,420 --> 01:36:09,560
this point

2497
01:36:06,050 --> 01:36:12,320

of course representing the full range of

2503
01:36:20,960 --> 01:36:26,090
experiences in the lgbtqia+ spectrum and

2504
01:36:24,200 --> 01:36:28,520

say for any hint of moral transgression

2511
01:36:40,460 --> 01:36:44,390
as well as critiquing your look a

2512
01:36:42,260 --> 01:36:46,670

believed to build that everywhere good I

just don't want to talk about why people

2516
01:36:50,840 --> 01:36:55,340
cancel and the effect that is having but

2517
01:36:53,330 --> 01:36:57,320
it looks like there's gonna have to be a

2518
01:36:55,340 --> 01:36:57,860
part to gorge because I have hit my

2519
01:36:57,320 --> 01:36:59,690
limit

2520
01:36:57,860 --> 01:37:02,420
so why don't we all cut our losses and

2521
01:36:59,690 --> 01:37:03,950
try again in 2020 mmmm I realize that

2522
01:37:02,420 --> 01:37:05,930
people on Twitter are actually gonna

2523
01:37:03,950 --> 01:37:07,820
watch this video they're just gonna make

2524
01:37:05,930 --> 01:37:10,280
fun of the title and how long it is

2525
01:37:07,820 --> 01:37:11,810
which fair enough but they're the ones

2526
01:37:10,280 --> 01:37:13,850
whose accusations against me are so

2527
01:37:11,810 --> 01:37:16,070
numerous and convoluted it required a

2528
01:37:13,850 --> 01:37:17,420
feature-length film to respond to the

2529
01:37:16,070 --> 01:37:19,850
other gonna see the title and they're

2530
01:37:17,420 --> 01:37:21,590
gonna transcribe quotes out of context

2531
01:37:19,850 --> 01:37:23,900
and they're gonna say I'm a fascist I'm

2532
01:37:21,590 --> 01:37:26,000
a turf I'm true scum I'm the new Blair

2533
01:37:23,900 --> 01:37:26,900
white I'm the new Laci green my missus

2534
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:29,030
but liquor

2535
01:37:26,900 --> 01:37:31,250
I'm an enlightened centrist I'm a [ __ ]

2536
01:37:29,030 --> 01:37:33,110
Lib I'm alright I'm a heartless grifter

2537
01:37:31,250 --> 01:37:35,390
raking in millions of dollars over the

2538
01:37:33,110 --> 01:37:38,300
bodies of dead trans women mask off

2539
01:37:35,390 --> 01:37:40,280
yikes this ain't it chief friendly

2540
01:37:38,300 --> 01:37:42,820
reminder that this isn't a good look

2541
01:37:40,280 --> 01:37:44,750
maybe don't be a [ __ ] licker

2542
01:37:42,820 --> 01:37:46,790
disappointing but they're saying all

2543
01:37:44,750 --> 01:37:48,440
those things already so I'm inoculated

2544
01:37:46,790 --> 01:37:50,300
see their mistake was completely

2545
01:37:48,440 --> 01:37:52,460
breaking my spirit they should have left

2546
01:37:50,300 --> 01:37:55,640
a little peace and talked but it's good

2547
01:37:52,460 --> 01:37:58,730
it's good it's good because basically my

2548
01:37:55,640 --> 01:38:01,760
survival from here on out hinges on my

2549
01:37:58,730 --> 01:38:07,940
ability to not care at all what people

2550
01:38:01,760 --> 01:38:09,060
say about me online so here's to not

2551
01:38:07,940 --> 01:39:27,050
giving a [ __ ]

2552
01:38:09,060 --> 01:39:29,340
[Music]

2553
01:39:27,050 --> 01:39:39,970

2560
01:40:16,360 --> 01:40:21,969
which is good because I'm not gonna age

2561
01:40:19,030 --> 01:40:26,969
gracefully and it's the best to get into

2562
01:40:21,969 --> 01:40:26,969
character now YouTube stars never die
