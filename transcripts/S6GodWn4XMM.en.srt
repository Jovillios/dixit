18
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:11,899

No welcome to the lab the lab of

aesthetic climatology is it hot in here

30
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:47,030
or is the world just like this now

31
00:01:43,149 --> 00:01:48,440
imagine that this is the earth this is

32
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:51,379
what the earth would look like if you

33
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:53,360
stabbed it with a giant knife in 1976 a

34
00:01:51,379 --> 00:01:54,830
beta [ __ ] named Al Gore led the first

35
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,989
congressional hearings on global warming

36
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:58,459
for the next several decades he devoted

37
00:01:56,989 --> 00:02:00,319
much of his career to raising public

38
00:01:58,459 --> 00:02:02,000
awareness about the grave predictions of

39
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:03,830
climate science in particular the

40
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,810
disastrous effects of global warming

41
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:08,060
induced by industrial carbon dioxide

42
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:10,700
emissions Gore's activism culminated in

43
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:12,590
2006 with the release of his documentary

44
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:13,220
An Inconvenient Truth but a month before

45
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:15,319
its release

46
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:17,569
Comedy Central aired an episode of South

47
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:19,849
Park ridiculing Gore has a hysterical

48
00:02:17,569 --> 00:02:21,650
buffoon obsessed with warning the nation

49
00:02:19,849 --> 00:02:25,690
about a mythological creature called

50
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:28,840
manbearpig it is half man half bear

51
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:30,820
and half-pig the episode portrays gore

52
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:33,310
as a narcissistic attention seeking

53
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:36,640
alarmist an issue however they care

54
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:42,760
about a sibilant moral i'm super-cereal

55
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:45,130
you guys we all had a good laugh at

56
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:48,100
Gore's foolishness after all no one

57
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:50,860
likes a complainer a critic a moralist a

58
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:52,960
killjoy a naysayer the embarr of bad

59
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:55,420
news and in fact a lot of us probably

60
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:57,370
remember manbearpig better than we

61
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:59,140
remember an inconvenient truth a lot of

62
00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:00,940
the backlash against gore seems to fit a

63
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:03,550
pattern described in the brilliant video

64
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:06,010
essay why are you so angry by innuendo

65
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:07,870
studios part 2 of the essay describes a

66
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:10,150
phenomenon I'll call the angry jak

67
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:11,860
effect it works like this you're on a

68
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:13,660
barbecue chef and brisket into your

69
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:15,220
front hole when you notice the person

70
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:17,200
seated next to you two clients to eat

71
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:19,360
any meat because they're vegan your

72
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,430
immediate instinctual reaction is anger

73
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,800
at the vegan because even if they're not

74
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:25,480
really judging you the mere fact that

75
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:28,150
they're a vegan means that they probably

76
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:30,040
have reasons for not eating meat and

77
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:32,680
that means there might be reasons why

78
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:34,480
you shouldn't leave me so what you do is

79
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:36,220
you lash out at the vegan and you tell

80
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,320
them oh so you think you're better than

81
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:41,040
me ha well I'll have you know that

82
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:43,450
eating meat is perfectly natural and

83
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:46,390
evolution and people who don't eat meat

84
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:48,580
well their bones fall out and besides

85
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:50,260
you're a hypocrite anyway because more

86
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:52,300
animals die when they plow the fields

87
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:54,370
for your stupid [ __ ] vegetables you

88
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:55,870
moral jerk of course this is all really

89
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:58,269
a rational response to the situation

90
00:03:55,870 --> 00:04:00,670
this is you subconsciously protecting

91
00:03:58,269 --> 00:04:02,709
your ego from potential guilt from the

92
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:04,480
potential accusation that you're a bad

93
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:06,010
person and you're protecting the

94
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,930
lifestyle that you enjoy and are

95
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:09,730
accustomed to from a potential threat

96
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:11,769
and this is essentially how people have

97
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:14,170
been reacting to Al Gore for decades

98
00:04:11,769 --> 00:04:16,120
he's a fun ruiner criticizing our high

99
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:18,400
emission way of life and instead of

100
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:20,230
engaging sincerely with the critique we

101
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,210
lash out at him so we don't have to

102
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:24,250
think about it the problem is that

103
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:26,680
scientifically speaking climate change

104
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:27,360
is in fact real and Gore was right all

105
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,879
along

106
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,919
scene oopsie

107
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:33,479
so now its current year and the global

108
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:35,699
temperature has risen one degree Celsius

109
00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:37,110
above the pre-industrial average which

110
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:39,270
is on track with the projections

111
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:40,740
presented in Gore's film now one degree

112
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:42,629
doesn't sound like much but to get a

113
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:45,479
sense of scale consider that the last

114
00:04:42,629 --> 00:04:47,610
ice age was only 4.5 degrees Celsius

115
00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:49,289
cooler than the 20th century norm we are

116
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:50,999
already at 1 degree warmer than the

117
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:53,279
pre-industrial average and current

118
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:54,959
scientific models put us on track for 3

119
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:56,939
degrees warmer by the end of the century

120
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:59,369
an outcome that would among other

121
00:04:56,939 --> 00:05:01,139
catastrophes completely flood Shanghai

122
00:04:59,369 --> 00:05:02,969
and Miami scientists have long

123
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:04,800
recommended that we limit warming to 2

124
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:06,779
degrees in order to avert global

125
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,979
Cataclysm but the latest report from the

126
00:05:06,779 --> 00:05:10,229
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate

127
00:05:07,979 --> 00:05:11,789
Change warns that even two degrees of

128
00:05:10,229 --> 00:05:14,129
warming could result in an iceless

129
00:05:11,789 --> 00:05:16,019
Arctic summer at least once a decade the

130
00:05:14,129 --> 00:05:18,059
destruction of nearly every coral reef

131
00:05:16,019 --> 00:05:20,129
and a heightened frequency of tropical

132
00:05:18,059 --> 00:05:22,110
cyclones droughts and famines around the

133
00:05:20,129 --> 00:05:24,659
world the report therefore recommends

134
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:26,189
that we limit warming to 1.5 degrees the

135
00:05:24,659 --> 00:05:27,749
goal that requires drastic and

136
00:05:26,189 --> 00:05:30,389
unprecedented reduction in emissions

137
00:05:27,749 --> 00:05:32,610
within the next 12 years and net zero

138
00:05:30,389 --> 00:05:34,199
emissions by 2050 but even limiting

139
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:35,869
warming to two degrees requires a

140
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:45,990
significant reduction in emissions

141
00:05:35,869 --> 00:05:48,149
otherwise we're on track look dawg

142
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:50,039
this is the same liberal media [ __ ]

143
00:05:48,149 --> 00:05:52,619
we've all heard for decades weather

144
00:05:50,039 --> 00:05:54,809
changes sometimes you were just talking

145
00:05:52,619 --> 00:05:56,759
about the obese age first it was cold no

146
00:05:54,809 --> 00:05:59,039
it's getting warmer that's just nature

147
00:05:56,759 --> 00:06:00,959
do you honestly think that all the

148
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:03,509
world's leading climate scientists just

149
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:06,240
forgot to take into account that weather

150
00:06:03,509 --> 00:06:07,559
changes sometimes isn't it obvious to

151
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,479
you that this whole guilt trip about

152
00:06:07,559 --> 00:06:11,699
carbon emissions is just an attack on

153
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:13,469
the American Way of life another excuse

154
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:15,300
for big government to take away my

155
00:06:13,469 --> 00:06:17,099
freedom what freedom are you an oil

156
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:19,079
company well what if i sexually identify

157
00:06:17,099 --> 00:06:21,779
as an oil company isn't that what you

158
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:23,999
liberals think my identity is valid no

159
00:06:21,779 --> 00:06:27,139
it isn't bring me the lake smelling salt

160
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:27,139
watch the goddamn video

161
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:34,170
imagine the year is 2100 I want you to

162
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:36,240
picture the earth as a human vagina and

163
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:38,610
imagine you're a gynecologist and you're

164
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,860
using a speculum to examine the inside

165
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:42,600
of a watermelon how does that make you

166
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:45,060
feel kids but you wish your

167
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:48,000
irresponsible gas guzzling parents had

168
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:49,830
done something to stop this so we may

169
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,020
have a global climate catastrophe fast

170
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:54,240
approaching but at least our political

171
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:56,280
leaders are responsible rational and

172
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,890
scientifically literate right is their

173
00:06:56,280 --> 00:07:01,110
climate change yeah will it go back like

174
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:03,270
this I mean will it change back probably

175
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:05,610
that's what I think I believe it goes

176
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:07,650
this way Donald Trump has a consistent

177
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:09,480
history of climate change denial from

178
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:10,950
his 2012 claim that global warming is a

179
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:13,290
Chinese hoax aimed at undermining

180
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:14,730
American manufacturing to his tweet last

181
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:17,160
week that it's very cold outside

182
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:18,900
therefore whatever happened to global

183
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:20,370
warming of course the term global

184
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:22,080
warming refers to the increase in the

185
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:24,390
global average temperature temperature

186
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:26,250
continuing to vary by region in fact

187
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:28,200
global warming could cause some regions

188
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:29,730
to become much colder for instance if

189
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:31,860
the ocean current known as the Atlantic

190
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:33,330
conveyor belt is disrupted chilling the

191
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:35,520
North Atlantic and potentially making

192
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:37,290
European winters more severe but Trump

193
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:40,170
doesn't know or care about any of that

194
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:42,240
he's kind of the anti Al Gore you know a

195
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:44,160
real man who takes what he wants by any

196
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,890
means necessary and won't be slowed down

197
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:49,650
by any worries about what's factual or

198
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:52,170
scientific or true or good or consensual

199
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:54,390
or just are safe for legal or even

200
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:56,970
possible he's the kind of man who

201
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:59,310
Americans collectively want on some sub

202
00:07:56,970 --> 00:08:01,290
rational erotic level to brutally

203
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:03,570
dominate us like an ancient Chinese God

204
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:05,880
Emperor Bern the scholars built the wall

205
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:07,140
with the problem at least for those of

206
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:09,120
you who don't actively enjoy

207
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:11,280
civilizations plunge into primeval

208
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,650
darkness is that the notion that there's

209
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,150
any actual scientific controversy about

210
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:17,280
the role of carbon emissions and global

211
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:19,380
warming is simply false

212
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:21,150
a 2013 analysis of the scientific

213
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:23,610
literature on climate change found that

214
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:25,410
97% of papers published on the subject

215
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:27,360
supported the conclusion that humans

216
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:29,280
caused global warming and the consensus

217
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,200
has only increased over time climate

218
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:33,539
change denial is considered an oddity in

219
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:35,159
Europe but is very common in the mare

220
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:37,890
largely as a result of a massive

221
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:39,750
campaign of manufactured uncertainty and

222
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:42,149
listen firm ation that goes back to the

223
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:44,159
early 1990s when the Western fuels

224
00:08:42,149 --> 00:08:46,350
Association developed a strategy to

225
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:48,839
quote reposition global warming as

226
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:50,670
Theory not fact and spent half a million

227
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:52,560
dollars researching the most effective

228
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:54,779
way to promote that message via a

229
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,850
propaganda campaign climate denialists

230
00:08:54,779 --> 00:08:58,529
talking points promoted by organizations

231
00:08:56,850 --> 00:09:00,300
in the subsequent decades have been

232
00:08:58,529 --> 00:09:02,279
statistically linked to funding from

233
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:04,170
ExxonMobil and the Koch family and

234
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:06,300
denialism has been frequently pushed by

235
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:08,459
Republican politicians perhaps most

236
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:10,440
vocally Senator James Inhofe whose

237
00:09:08,459 --> 00:09:12,060
campaigns are financed by oil and energy

238
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,830
companies and who's presented on the

239
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:16,620
Senate floor such compelling arguments

240
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:19,890
as throwing a snowball tone the lifts so

241
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:21,690
mr. president this mm-hmm denialists

242
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:24,000
talking points have trickled down from

243
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:25,890
the reptilian overlords to the ordinary

244
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,810
youtube comment goblins where they

245
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:30,060
provide ammunition for the angry jak

246
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:31,610
effect just like Al Gore or any

247
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:34,260
messenger of inconvenient information

248
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:36,390
climate scientists themselves have for

249
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:38,310
years been targets of endless harassment

250
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:40,260
Michael Mann the original publisher of

251
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:42,390
the hockey stick graph has received

252
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:44,790
thousands of hate messages death threats

253
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:46,529
even white powder in the mail the mental

254
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:48,240
health of many climate scientists is

255
00:09:46,529 --> 00:09:50,520
actually suffering as a result of

256
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,380
harassment denial the Bleak political

257
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:54,450
situation and the daily grind of

258
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:56,010
studying a cataclysmic future it's

259
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:57,959
likely that this video will attract some

260
00:09:56,010 --> 00:10:00,120
deniers and I therefore invite my

261
00:09:57,959 --> 00:10:01,920
audience to use the denialist debunking

262
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:04,380
resource listed in the top comment below

263
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,970
to refute such claims as there's still

264
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:08,070
scientific controversy about the cause

265
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:10,110
of climate change there isn't what if

266
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:11,700
the Sun is getting hotter it's not at

267
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:15,270
least in the relevant time frame and

268
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:16,770
science is a liar sometimes even if you

269
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:18,600
don't believe in science maybe you'll

270
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:21,029
find it convincing that even many oil

271
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:22,800
companies including Exxon Mobil now

272
00:10:21,029 --> 00:10:24,750
acknowledge climate change is real and

273
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,279
caused by human activity in fact at the

274
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:28,529
behest of oil companies the state of

275
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:30,540
Texas is now seeking at least 12 billion

276
00:10:28,529 --> 00:10:32,670
dollars in public funds to build a

277
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:34,589
60-mile spine of sea walls along the

278
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:36,450
Gulf Coast largely to protect oil

279
00:10:34,589 --> 00:10:38,520
refineries from rising tides and more

280
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:41,400
severe tropical storms after hurricane

281
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:44,279
Harvey Texas lobbied Congress for 61

282
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:46,350
billion dollars to quote future-proof to

283
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:48,420
state despite the fact that many of its

284
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:50,339
top politicians are public climate

285
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:52,350
change deniers remember how it used to

286
00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:54,240
be called global warming and then

287
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:55,980
magically the theory change due climate

288
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,079
change sure the reason is it wasn't

289
00:10:55,980 --> 00:11:00,870
warming do not listen to the Kant of

290
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:01,260
these sneering Reptoids the science is

291
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:03,270
clear

292
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:05,730
climate change is real and humans are

293
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:08,100
causing it if even ExxonMobil says it's

294
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:09,750
real it's probably real there's really

295
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:11,520
no point in digging in your heels and

296
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:18,839
refusing to look at the evidence just

297
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:22,170
because you don't want to be ok fine so

298
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:24,300
maybe the world is getting and maybe

299
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:26,070
humans has something to do with it

300
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:31,740
now can you give me my smelling salts

301
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:33,390
fine look dawg I gotta say maybe the

302
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:36,690
scientists are right maybe it is

303
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:38,160
happening but to be honest with you I'm

304
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:40,620
having a hard time caring about this

305
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,270
like at all how can you not care about

306
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:43,860
this we're talking about the future of

307
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:46,140
the planet well I don't care about the

308
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:48,779
planet I care about me well don't you

309
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:50,490
live on the planet mm-hmm and don't you

310
00:11:48,779 --> 00:11:59,550
care what happens to the planet you live

311
00:11:50,490 --> 00:12:00,990
on no god damn it watch the video if you

312
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:02,640
picture the earth as a watermelon you

313
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:04,470
can see there's the outer shell here

314
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:06,440
that traps the red flesh and if you

315
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:09,209
leave it out at midnight the stalkers

316
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:11,040
this doctor is coming for the red flash

317
00:12:09,209 --> 00:12:13,020
before describing the details of our

318
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,850
doom let's take a moment to review how

319
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:16,290
we got where we are the modernist

320
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:19,260
science of anthropogenic climate change

321
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:21,360
began in 1896 when a Swedish science

322
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:23,279
jerk called sponte Jorge Gnaeus

323
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,199
published a study titled on the

324
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:27,120
influence of carbonic acid in the air

325
00:12:25,199 --> 00:12:29,220
upon the temperature of the earth in

326
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,990
which he predicted the industrial carbon

327
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:33,360
dioxide production would eventually have

328
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:34,949
a warming effect on the planet by 1960

329
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:37,140
scientists had demonstrated that the

330
00:12:34,949 --> 00:12:39,270
level of co2 in the atmosphere was in

331
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:41,339
fact rising and President [ __ ]

332
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:43,770
Johnson's Science Advisory Committee

333
00:12:41,339 --> 00:12:45,600
warned that industrial co2 emissions

334
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:47,670
could have a greenhouse warming effect

335
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:50,970
the Stanford Research Institute warned

336
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:52,890
the American Petroleum Institute in 1968

337
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:54,579
that continued emissions would lead to

338
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:56,499
Antarctic melting and rising

339
00:12:54,579 --> 00:12:59,679
see levels but nothing was really done

340
00:12:56,499 --> 00:13:01,569
about it until 1988 when NASA announced

341
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:03,160
to the US Senate that the earth was

342
00:13:01,569 --> 00:13:05,199
warmer than any time in modern history

343
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:08,319
that the warming could be attributed to

344
00:13:05,199 --> 00:13:10,360
human causes with 99% certainty that the

345
00:13:08,319 --> 00:13:13,119
warming was worsening heat waves storms

346
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:14,889
and droughts that same year the IPCC was

347
00:13:13,119 --> 00:13:16,449
formed to provide world leaders with a

348
00:13:14,889 --> 00:13:18,730
summary of the science on climate change

349
00:13:16,449 --> 00:13:20,980
and its political and economic impacts

350
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:23,170
so it started to seem like something was

351
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:25,749
going to change but by the early 1990s

352
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:27,549
the oil and energy funded climatology

353
00:13:25,749 --> 00:13:29,619
denial industry was up and running in

354
00:13:27,549 --> 00:13:31,600
the United States despite the fact that

355
00:13:29,619 --> 00:13:33,819
oil companies had known climate change

356
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,889
was happening for decades and Republican

357
00:13:33,819 --> 00:13:38,499
politicians became mouthpieces for the

358
00:13:35,889 --> 00:13:40,149
so-called skeptic cause meanwhile the

359
00:13:38,499 --> 00:13:42,369
Clinton administration signed the Kyoto

360
00:13:40,149 --> 00:13:44,379
Protocol pledging the United States to

361
00:13:42,369 --> 00:13:45,999
reduce greenhouse gas emissions a pledge

362
00:13:44,379 --> 00:13:47,980
that the Bush administration then

363
00:13:45,999 --> 00:13:49,959
refused to make good on the 2012

364
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:52,119
Republican platform stated against all

365
00:13:49,959 --> 00:13:53,980
scientific consensus that quote the

366
00:13:52,119 --> 00:13:56,019
causes and long-range effects of a

367
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:57,369
phenomenon are uncertain an opposed

368
00:13:56,019 --> 00:14:00,610
regulation of greenhouse gas emissions

369
00:13:57,369 --> 00:14:02,410
then finally in 2015

370
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:05,619
things seemed to be changing for the

371
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:07,749
better 195 nations including China India

372
00:14:05,619 --> 00:14:09,519
and the United States under Obama became

373
00:14:07,749 --> 00:14:11,019
parties to the Paris agreement which

374
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:12,999
established the goal of limiting the

375
00:14:11,019 --> 00:14:15,100
increase in global temperature to well

376
00:14:12,999 --> 00:14:17,499
below two degrees Celsius for the very

377
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:19,209
next year Donald Trump was elected

378
00:14:17,499 --> 00:14:21,160
president for the United States when a

379
00:14:19,209 --> 00:14:23,169
platform of outright climate science

380
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:24,459
denial Trump has since begun withdrawing

381
00:14:23,169 --> 00:14:25,929
the United States from the Paris

382
00:14:24,459 --> 00:14:27,519
agreement appointed a climate change

383
00:14:25,929 --> 00:14:29,350
denier the head of the Environmental

384
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:31,989
Protection Agency and released his

385
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:33,850
America first energy plan which

386
00:14:31,989 --> 00:14:36,249
encourages unregulated burning of fossil

387
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:38,769
fuels so it's with a particular sense of

388
00:14:36,249 --> 00:14:41,559
doom that we now receive the grim 2018

389
00:14:38,769 --> 00:14:43,299
IPCC report which informs us that the

390
00:14:41,559 --> 00:14:43,989
world has already warmed 1 degrees

391
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:45,970
Celsius

392
00:14:43,989 --> 00:14:47,919
resulting in significant melting of both

393
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:49,689
polar ice caps increased average

394
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:51,579
temperatures increased extreme weather

395
00:14:49,689 --> 00:14:53,649
events and increased mosquito-borne

396
00:14:51,579 --> 00:14:55,959
illnesses like malaria dengue and Zika

397
00:14:53,649 --> 00:14:59,649
if drastic action is taken to reduce

398
00:14:55,959 --> 00:15:02,259
carbon emissions 49% by 2030 and to net

399
00:14:59,649 --> 00:15:04,749
zero carbon by 2050 global warming will

400
00:15:02,259 --> 00:15:06,879
still increase to 1.5 degrees above the

401
00:15:04,749 --> 00:15:07,480
pre-industrial average resulting in a

402
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:09,339
doubling of

403
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:11,860
populations exposed to water scarcity

404
00:15:09,339 --> 00:15:14,079
and drought and an estimated 10 trillion

405
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:15,430
dollars in annual flood damage losses

406
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:16,779
from sea-level rise

407
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:19,449
but with the current political situation

408
00:15:16,779 --> 00:15:21,190
the goal of reducing warming to 1.5

409
00:15:19,449 --> 00:15:23,260
degrees is quickly slipping above reach

410
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:25,029
but the end of the century were likely

411
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:26,260
to see at least 2 degrees of warming

412
00:15:25,029 --> 00:15:28,839
which will lead to the eventual

413
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:30,760
displacement of 200 million people in

414
00:15:28,839 --> 00:15:32,350
coastal regions three degrees of warming

415
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:34,449
will flood many of the world's major

416
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:35,050
coastal cities including Shanghai and

417
00:15:34,449 --> 00:15:37,839
Miami

418
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:40,000
Osaka Rio de Janeiro Alexandria and Hong

419
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:41,680
Kong 4 degrees of warming will be close

420
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,480
to the difference between early 20th

421
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:45,940
century temperatures in the last ice age

422
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:47,500
a global crisis of hundreds of millions

423
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:49,930
of refugees from Island and coastal

424
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:52,060
areas will be exacerbated by severe

425
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:54,130
droughts and water scarcity trillions of

426
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:57,430
dollars of damage to the economy famines

427
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:59,199
starvation terrorism and war so it's not

428
00:15:57,430 --> 00:16:01,180
just the poor polar bears and coral

429
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:04,899
reefs there are real human consequences

430
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:06,610
to this see this is why you should care

431
00:16:04,899 --> 00:16:07,690
it's not just about the planet it's

432
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:09,550
about the millions of people who are

433
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:13,930
gonna die or lose their homes

434
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:16,630
oh jeez wow that's gosh that's really

435
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:20,380
just too bad what kind of response is

436
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:22,540
that look doc people die all the time

437
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:24,160
what am I supposed to do cry about it

438
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:29,610
know what you're supposed to take

439
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:35,800
political action yeah I guess I could

440
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:37,180
but this bath is barely relaxing well

441
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:39,190
look even if you only care about

442
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:41,050
yourself you do realize that when the

443
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:42,790
coastal cities flood we're gonna have to

444
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:44,980
take in tens of millions of refugees

445
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:47,620
right are you gonna be ok with that

446
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:49,899
no well then you'd better do something

447
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:51,040
to reduce carbon emissions No well then

448
00:16:49,899 --> 00:16:54,519
you'd better be ready to take it a lot

449
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:56,620
of refugees know you do realize right

450
00:16:54,519 --> 00:16:58,060
that in a hundred years everyone is

451
00:16:56,620 --> 00:17:00,639
going to look back on people like you

452
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:01,839
and they're gonna hate you so much for

453
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:04,329
what you allowed to happen to this

454
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:06,910
planet well those are future people I'm

455
00:17:04,329 --> 00:17:08,530
alive now and besides and what you're

456
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:10,750
saying is true then this is basically

457
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:13,059
the apocalypse anyway so why not just

458
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:14,919
party and enjoy ourselves right but it's

459
00:17:13,059 --> 00:17:15,530
not the apocalypse though call it the

460
00:17:14,919 --> 00:17:17,090
epochal

461
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:19,280
is literally just another form of

462
00:17:17,090 --> 00:17:21,200
denialism because we still have a little

463
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:23,990
bit of time to fix the problem please

464
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:26,390
God please just try to focus on solving

465
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:28,100
the problem we still have time so you're

466
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:28,300
saying the world is something cheers to

467
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:31,250
that

468
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:33,410
the world is not ending its just getting

469
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:34,700
shittier well what am I supposed to do

470
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:37,610
about it let's watch an instructional

471
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:40,450
video to learn more all right let me

472
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:40,450
just reappear

473
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:54,700
ah all right dog put it in me you're

474
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:57,340
repulsive what so sorry you're offended

475
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:59,590
by pleasure I'm not offended by what

476
00:17:57,340 --> 00:18:02,049
this offends you doesn't make are you

477
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:04,419
favorite liberal are you bring her home

478
00:18:02,049 --> 00:18:05,650
I'm not triggers stop trying to pretend

479
00:18:04,419 --> 00:18:06,940
you're not home you know you really

480
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:09,160
shouldn't be supporting the dairy

481
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:12,130
industry they caused a massive carbon

482
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:15,130
emissions well maybe you shouldn't be

483
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:18,100
supporting the clothes industry

484
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:20,559
hypocrite why it's so milk anyway

485
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:22,720
science nerd how do you think I got so

486
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:24,100
feminine there's nothing in science to

487
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:28,049
support that just admit that you're

488
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:28,049
offended please just watch the video

489
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:38,200
when I was a little girl I used to sit

490
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:40,570
on the porch eating watermelon and I'd

491
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:42,460
stare up at the stars and wonder where

492
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:45,100
did they all come from you know what

493
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:47,770
does this all mean the cosmos humanity

494
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:50,230
our little time here on earth and that's

495
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:55,690
why I became a scientist so I can spend

496
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:58,320
my life studying top aspheric trace

497
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:58,320
gases

498
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:05,620
[Music]

499
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:07,420
if you want to do your part to stop

500
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:09,490
climate change there are some lifestyle

501
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:11,590
changes you can make you can use LED

502
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:13,240
light bulbs you can drive a hybrid or

503
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:15,460
electric car you can use public

504
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:17,860
transportation you can try not to fly

505
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:20,380
very often you can eat less red meat so

506
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:22,720
the reality is just 100 companies are

507
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:24,880
responsible for 71 percent of global

508
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,350
emissions and the burden of stopping

509
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,210
this can't really be placed on

510
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:30,520
individual consumers the companies

511
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:32,470
themselves do not care left to their own

512
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:34,150
devices they will only pursue short-term

513
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:36,160
profit they will ask the government to

514
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:38,440
build them sea walls while continuing to

515
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:40,090
emit greenhouse gases climate change is

516
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:42,520
exactly the kind of problem that

517
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:44,710
capitalism is really ill-equipped to

518
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:46,720
solve the timeframe involved is short

519
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:48,760
enough that scientists can predict total

520
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:51,370
catastrophe in the foreseeable future

521
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:53,290
but just long enough not to enter into

522
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:55,420
the shareholder pleasing decision-making

523
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:56,860
of corporations so unless there's a

524
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:59,410
drastic change in the next couple

525
00:19:56,860 --> 00:20:01,270
decades this is going to be capitalism's

526
00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:03,130
great Chinese famine moment only

527
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:05,290
potentially it'll be much much worse

528
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:07,090
this is probably the most important

529
00:20:05,290 --> 00:20:09,250
issue facing humanity in the 21st

530
00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:10,420
century so we kinda need to fix it by

531
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:12,970
any means necessary

532
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:15,070
beginning with rapid political change if

533
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:16,870
that means direct action it means direct

534
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:19,270
action for instance organizing

535
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:21,370
participating in or supporting a massive

536
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:23,050
general strike you also should demand

537
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:25,120
that your politicians take a strong

538
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:26,920
stance against climate change and the

539
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:29,710
companies that caused it and if your

540
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:32,200
American vote this monumental dingdong

541
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:34,180
of the Oval Office in 2020 before the

542
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:36,780
entire planet shrinks and transforms

543
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:36,780
into a corncob

544
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:43,690
so let me get this straight

545
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:45,490
you want me to go vegan dry our Prius

546
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:47,170
and vote Democrat you're basically

547
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:49,390
asking me to completely change who I am

548
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:50,950
as a person and become everything I hate

549
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:53,080
yeah pretty much

550
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:55,120
but it's not about what I want it's

551
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:57,100
about what everyone has to do to

552
00:20:55,120 --> 00:21:01,570
preserve the survival of humanity

553
00:20:57,100 --> 00:21:03,250
well electric cars veganism who can even

554
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:06,940
afford that [ __ ] maybe you could afford

555
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:07,690

558
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:14,530
will not stoop to drinking Italian

559
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,840
dishwater you know eating plant-based

560
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:20,710

562
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:27,430

567
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:41,650
when you could eat pure clean and

568
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:44,520
natural foods like lentils barley and

569
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:44,520

I supposed to care about rising sea

574
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:56,730
levels when there's Muslims out there

575
