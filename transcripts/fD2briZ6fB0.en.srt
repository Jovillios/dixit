1
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:11,400
imagine how a woman feels imagine how

2
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:13,559
soft and warm our skin feels imagine the

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:16,350
sweet smell of her perfume

4
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:18,060
imagine her tenderly pressing as soft

5
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:19,920
lips against yours

6
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:23,550
imagine her letting you get on top of

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:26,400
him and insert you inside her softly

8
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:27,840
moaning as it slides in imagine the

9
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:34,020
walls of her tight

10
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:36,870
soft warm wrapped around every inch of

11
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:39,750
you imagine her breathing getting

12
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:42,210
heavier with every thrust imagine her

13
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:45,180
wrapping her arms and legs around you

14
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:48,510
holding you as close as she possibly can

15
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:53,430
and begging you to inside her as you

16
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:55,649
release every ounce of yours into her

17
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:58,800
and imagine the feeling of pure

18
00:00:55,649 --> 00:01:01,949
satisfaction and peace that comes

19
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:06,479
afterwards and looking beside you to see

20
00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:11,030
a person that cares about you and has

21
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:15,960
accepted you in the most intimate way

22
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:19,380
possible you will never get to

23
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:22,680
experience this because your skeleton is

24
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:25,810
too small or the bones in your face and

25
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:30,370
not the proper shape have a nice day

26
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:30,370
[Music]

27
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:36,600
hello boys let's talk about bone

28
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:42,459
structure

29
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:42,459
[Music]

30
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:47,750
there's something basically Soviet about

31
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:50,210
the way the internet names things Stalin

32
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:52,939
had portmanteaus like agitprop Politburo

33
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:55,820
and compromise and we have webinar

34
00:01:52,939 --> 00:01:58,189
podcast and insel short for involuntary

35
00:01:55,820 --> 00:02:00,470
celibate the word insult was invented in

36
00:01:58,189 --> 00:02:02,330
the late 90s by a lonely bisexual called

37
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:04,909
Ilana who created a website called

38
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:06,649
Alana's and voluntary celibacy project

39
00:02:04,909 --> 00:02:09,560
it was essentially a safe space for

40
00:02:06,649 --> 00:02:11,330
people who just couldn't get it in but

41
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:13,400
in our own miserable moment of internet

42
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:15,340
history the word in cell refers to a

43
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:18,170
more specific community of mostly

44
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:20,510
heterosexual men centered around forums

45
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:21,049
like in assault me and our slash brain

46
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:22,850
cells

47
00:02:21,049 --> 00:02:24,980
this group has recently gotten a lot of

48
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:26,600
bad press because for the last few years

49
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:28,370
they've been churning out mass murderers

50
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:30,349
faster than Marvel can make Avengers

51
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:32,900
movies but most in cells aren't violent

52
00:02:30,349 --> 00:02:35,000
killers they're just men who formed an

53
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:36,950
identity around not getting laid in this

54
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,989
video I don't want to mock in cells or

55
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:41,000
lecture them or even sympathize with

56
00:02:38,989 --> 00:02:43,489
them I just want to understand who they

57
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,840
are and why they're like this to start

58
00:02:43,489 --> 00:02:46,640
with sometimes the best way to

59
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:48,650
understand a person's world is to learn

60
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:53,870
their language and the language of the

61
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:56,420
in cells about you'll see first base in

62
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:58,700
sillies does it ever bother you that the

63
00:02:56,420 --> 00:03:00,920
word women makes adult females sound

64
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:02,630
just a little bit too human well in

65
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:04,920
cells have a solution to that we've

66
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:07,040
taken to calling women

67
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:09,350
[Applause]

68
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:11,630
the choice of vocabulary tells us how

69
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:13,370
insults think of women not as sisters or

70
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:14,959
mothers and certainly not as autonomous

71
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:17,150
people but as a kind of foreign

72
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:19,819
inscrutable object comparable to a

73
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:21,769
natural resource unobtainium to which n

74
00:03:19,819 --> 00:03:23,209
cells believe all men are entitled into

75
00:03:21,769 --> 00:03:25,250
which they feel they have been unjustly

76
00:03:23,209 --> 00:03:27,500
denied there's a long tradition of nerdy

77
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:30,260
men talking about women in nerdily

78
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:32,090
misogynistic ways a reminded of famed

79
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:34,700
rocket scientist fair enough on brown's

80
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:36,150
remark about female astronauts we are

81
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:39,120
reserving

82
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:41,519
than ten pounds of payload for

83
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,930
recreational equipment which is not to

84
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:45,480
say that alpha males are less

85
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:48,480
misogynistic than nerds but simply that

86
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:50,489
nerds have a nerdy style of misogyny now

87
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,500
fee mode is about as neutral a term as

88
00:03:50,489 --> 00:03:54,150
in cells half for women and it's only

89
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:57,209
downhill from there there's the usual

90
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:59,280
standbys [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] while

91
00:03:57,209 --> 00:04:01,590
conveying a searing resentment of female

92
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:04,170
sexuality the pinnacle of which is

93
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:06,420
represented by the bespoke insel coinage

94
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:08,250
roasty which i'm sorry to inform you

95
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:10,290
refers to the insult believe that the

96
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:12,060
human vulva become mutilated through

97
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:14,190
repeated penetration by different men

98
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:15,840
though not through repeated penetration

99
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:18,389
by the same man interestingly and

100
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,070
thereby come to resemble roast beef now

101
00:04:18,389 --> 00:04:22,260
by definition in cells haven't actually

102
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:24,449
observed any vaginas but to n cells

103
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:26,699
Anatomy is more a matter of metaphysical

104
00:04:24,449 --> 00:04:28,349
speculation than crude science though if

105
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:31,020
you ask me the right metaphor for a

106
00:04:28,349 --> 00:04:36,630
veteran vag is not roast beef but sour

107
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:37,620
greens of course not all females are

108
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:40,080
created equal

109
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:42,810
there are various subspecies the Becca

110
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:45,900
hue or nor me free mode is to be

111
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:48,479
contrasted with the Stacey or sexually

112
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:52,289
desirable female whose distinguishing

00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:55,680
features include make up on point never

buns alone you savages the Stasi

118
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:10,500
naturally has a male counterpart whom in

119
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:14,159
cells called the Chad a Chad is a hunky

120
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:17,340
alpha whose hands are always prepared to

121
00:05:14,159 --> 00:05:20,310
grab nearby fertile [ __ ] he has never

122
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:23,210
heard a song in his entire life he has a

123
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:27,120
sloped forehead with a strong brow

124
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:29,940
rambhau chin strong jawline flat

125
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:32,630
occipital plate it must needs be

126
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:35,789
remarked but the skull of the Chad

127
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:39,300
exhibited the brow Ridge most pronounced

128
00:05:35,789 --> 00:05:42,430
whereas the skull of the Virgin is most

129
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:45,510
inadequate in this regard predisposing

130
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:48,700
such specimens to an abject existence of

131
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:50,650
lamentation and cuckold rare it's time

132
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:52,720
to talk about bone structure according

133
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:56,470
to a classic in Soul mean the difference

134
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:59,710
between Chad and long Chad is literally

135
00:05:56,470 --> 00:06:02,920
a few millimeters of bone I would like

136
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:05,170
to propose a sociological theory fentons

137
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:07,630
law once bigotry or self-loathing

138
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:09,340
permeate a given community it is only a

139
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:11,680
matter of time before deep metaphysical

140
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:13,150
significance is assigned to the shape of

141
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:16,300
human skulls

142
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:18,610
why skulls you ask well the best

143
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:21,640
explanation I can come up with is that a

144
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:23,440
skull is inanimate and unchangeable it's

145
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:25,510
there for the perfect symbol of the

146
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:27,640
intrinsic and permanent characteristics

147
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:29,470
that bigots like to assign to certain

148
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:31,690
groups of people if you believe for

149
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:34,000
example that a certain race or gender is

150
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:36,040
intellectually inferior you can justify

151
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,400
your belief by pointing to the shape of

152
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:41,890
the skull and saying well that's the

153
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:43,240
reason why it's just nature there's

154
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:45,880
nothing that can be done about it

155
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:48,400
and that is exactly the way in cells

156
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:50,110
think about love and celibacy mankind is

157
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,060
divided into two groups of people

158
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:53,980
the Chad's with the [ __ ] skulls and

159
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:58,480
the in cells whose bones come up a few

160
00:06:53,980 --> 00:07:00,520
millimeters short korndog anyone I'm

161
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:02,320
really hungry of course there's not just

162
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:04,210
the skulls the insoles blame for their

163
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:06,100
sexlessness they have a whole dictionary

164
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:08,350
of jharkhand explaining the causes of

165
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:10,150
involuntary celibacy height cells are

166
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:12,400
insulted their inferior stature

167
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:14,710
whereas mental cells can attract women

168
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,570
because of mental illness or autism or

169
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:19,750
they're addicts and then called drug

170
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:22,090
cells risk cells on the other hand are

171
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:24,970
doomed by their overly delicate wrists

172
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:27,160
no obsessing about your wrist size does

173
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:29,500
seem a little weird oh yeah is it a

174
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:32,290
little weird that the average dildo has

175
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:34,570
more girth than my wrist is it weird at

176
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:37,090
all but some men have thicker dicks than

177
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:39,190
my wrists but yeah obviously obsessing

178
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:41,500
about my tiny wrists that are smaller

179
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:43,900
than even many women's is completely a

180
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:45,460
rational body dysmorphia and the reason

181
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:47,200
why no one wants to be with me or even

182
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:50,380
talked to me is my shitty personality

183
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:52,689
even though literal 80 IQ men who have

184
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:55,089
nothing to talk about except who won the

185
00:07:52,689 --> 00:07:59,259
last night are still able to attract a

186
00:07:55,089 --> 00:08:00,969
loving partner interesting a significant

187
00:07:59,259 --> 00:08:02,649
number of in cells are not white in

188
00:08:00,969 --> 00:08:04,329
which case their unfuck ability is

189
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:06,189
attributed to race and they are

190
00:08:04,329 --> 00:08:10,989
accordingly termed apologies in advance

191
00:08:06,189 --> 00:08:12,579
black cells race cells kuri cells and so

192
00:08:10,989 --> 00:08:14,619
on which is not to say that all

193
00:08:12,579 --> 00:08:16,539
non-white men are celibate there are of

194
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:18,669
course the occasional chad's of color

195
00:08:16,539 --> 00:08:20,739
with their superior skulls and towering

196
00:08:18,669 --> 00:08:25,329
stature whom the N cells have christened

197
00:08:20,739 --> 00:08:27,669
Tyrone's Chang's and Chad priests I'm so

198
00:08:25,329 --> 00:08:29,739
sorry so you can be in it cell because

199
00:08:27,669 --> 00:08:31,839
of your looks your height your mind or

200
00:08:29,739 --> 00:08:33,969
your race but we unites them all as the

201
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:34,629
conviction that love and sex are forever

202
00:08:33,969 --> 00:08:36,879
out of reach

203
00:08:34,629 --> 00:08:39,099
unless of course you delusional II

204
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:41,649
imagine that you can ascend that is

205
00:08:39,099 --> 00:08:43,360
escape your n cell donor if you falsely

206
00:08:41,649 --> 00:08:46,029
and pathetically believe that there is

207
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:48,220
any possibility of improvement well that

208
00:08:46,029 --> 00:08:52,899
makes you the lowest of the low a sad

209
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:55,360
and sorry hopes cell second base the red

210
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:57,399
pill so we have the building blocks of

211
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:00,220
the in cell world view the stacy is the

212
00:08:57,399 --> 00:09:01,750
Chad's the in cells and the normies from

213
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:04,750
these elements in cells I've constructed

214
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:07,569
a theory of human nature and sexuality

215
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:09,220
which they call the red pill in cells

216
00:09:07,569 --> 00:09:11,379
share the red pill worldview with the

217
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:13,600
rest of the manosphere that is pickup

218
00:09:11,379 --> 00:09:15,309
artists men's rights activists and the

219
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,500
voluntary celibate community you known

220
00:09:15,309 --> 00:09:19,720
as men going their own way of revealed

221
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:21,699
in make toe according to red pill theory

222
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:24,250
women are by nature high Pergamus

223
00:09:21,699 --> 00:09:26,319
hypergamy new greek for marrying above

224
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:27,910
refers to the practice of seeking

225
00:09:26,319 --> 00:09:30,610
relationships with men above one's

226
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:31,089
social status and also an in sell you

227
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:33,189
such

228
00:09:31,089 --> 00:09:35,350
above one's attractiveness according to

229
00:09:33,189 --> 00:09:37,000
n sells physical attractiveness is

230
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:39,550
naturally distributed equally between

231
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,680
the sexes so if you were to assign

232
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:43,870
numerical ratings to attractiveness as

233
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:46,449
in cells like to do there would be about

234
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:48,519
as many say eight out of ten women has a

235
00:09:46,449 --> 00:09:50,889
den of ten men in cells believe that an

236
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:52,629
adjust world a five out of ten man would

237
00:09:50,889 --> 00:09:55,000
naturally wind up in a relationship

238
00:09:52,629 --> 00:09:56,770
with his looks match that is

239
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,290
five out of ten woman equivalently

240
00:09:56,770 --> 00:10:01,270
attractive to himself but sadly this

241
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:03,790
just system has been ruined by hate

242
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:05,740
Pergamus women who regardless of their

243
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:08,320
own attractiveness were only interested

244
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:10,540
in dating Chad in South sometimes call

245
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:13,150
this the 80/20 rule the idea that only

246
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:15,580
the top 20% of men will ever be desired

247
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:17,410
by women now since most heterosexual men

248
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:19,480
do end up in relationships with women

249
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:21,130
you might be raising your eyebrow at

250
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:23,110
that idea but in sales have an

251
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:23,650
explanation according to the red pill

252
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:25,870
theory

253
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:28,870
women often pursue a mating strategy

254
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:29,860
called alpha [ __ ] beta box this means

255
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:32,500
that her in her 20s

256
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:34,870
a woman will as insel say ride the [ __ ]

257
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:37,060
carousel sleeping with as many Chad's as

258
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:38,920
possible when she ages into her 30s she

259
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:41,170
will settle down with a baton or me whom

260
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:43,210
she's not really attracted to become she

261
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:45,220
will use for financial support all the

262
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:47,500
while continuously cuckolding him on the

263
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:49,420
alpha [ __ ] carousel before inevitably

264
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:51,070
abandoning him taking him for everything

265
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:52,570
he's worth on a divorce settlement and

266
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:53,920
running off to the Mediterranean with

267
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:54,640
all the children and a new Chad

268
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,350
boyfriend

269
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,900
well the beta [ __ ] has left behind to

270
00:10:56,350 --> 00:11:00,940
fester and alimony payments solitude and

271
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:02,770
poverty so the upshot of the red pill

272
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:04,930
theory is that for men there are three

273
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:06,610
possible outcomes either you're an Enzo

274
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:09,040
doomed to a lifetime of excruciating

275
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:10,600
loneliness and resentment or urine or me

276
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,400
destined to wind up in a sexless

277
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:14,020
marriage with an unfaithful wife who

278
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:15,640
will divorce you win custody of the

279
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:19,690
children and run off with all your money

280
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:22,060
or you could be an alpha an independent

281
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:24,220
promiscuous man who sleeps with lots of

282
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:26,140
women and forms attachments to none of

283
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:28,300
them in the red pill philosophy there

284
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:30,730
are two ways to become alpha the first

285
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:33,190
is simply to be a Chad by nature the

286
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:35,020
second is to become a pickup artist red

287
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:36,550
Pelt pickup artists believe basically

288
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:38,020
the same things about women that Anna

289
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:41,260
sells believe that they are high

290
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:43,060
Pergamus duplicitous and [ __ ] but

291
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:45,250
not lovable the difference is that

292
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:46,750
pickup artists are not celibate in fact

293
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:48,880
they try to have sex with as many women

294
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:51,160
as possible by following a series of

295
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:53,290
strategies and scripts known as game as

296
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:54,970
described for the book of that title as

297
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:58,300
well as by the red pill pickup artists

298
00:11:54,970 --> 00:12:01,180
Roosh V author of a book called bang

299
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:04,000
a new mascara from benefit so the tube

300
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:09,280
is bomb I am living to see what the wand

301
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:11,590
looks like oh it's so big whatever it

302
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:14,680
Roush is up to lately I baked my own

303
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:16,900
bread yes I am outing myself as a baker

304
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:17,590
as someone who likes to cook I'm not a

305
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:20,620
woman

306
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:22,270
I am ultra masculine as you can see but

307
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:25,210
baking and cooking in general is a

308
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:28,030
scientific thing and men like scientific

309
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:29,950
things I used to be a a scientist well

310
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:32,200
ruch you know what if it means you leave

311
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:35,260
women alone I hope you enjoy your new

312
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:38,290
life as an ultra masculine Baker sorry I

313
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:39,970
mean bread scientists so remember the

314
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:42,280
red pill is the realization that women

315
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:43,630
are high Pergamus by nature 20% or less

316
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:45,640
of men are really attractive to women

317
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:47,860
dating as a sexual marketplace and

318
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:49,570
feminism is a pretext for enabling women

319
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:51,400
to behave however they want while

320
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:53,260
consigning men to emasculation and

321
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:55,060
impotence the black pill is the

322
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:56,890
additional realization that one's place

323
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:58,450
in the sexual marketplace is genetically

324
00:12:56,890 --> 00:13:00,340
determined that one is a permanent

325
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:01,840
version that sex and relationships are

326
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:03,910
forever out of reach and hence that

327
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:06,190
happiness is impossible there's nothing

328
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:08,770
one can do except slide down and rocked

329
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:11,110
the black pill is essentially dogmatic

330
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:12,910
hopelessness about dating and about life

331
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:15,760
in general it's the pinnacle of what

332
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:17,800
psychotherapists call catastrophizing a

333
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:19,240
cognitive distortion where anxiety or

334
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:21,430
depression leads you to infer

335
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:23,710
apocalyptic conclusions from mundane

336
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:25,390
setbacks and anxieties for instance a

337
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:27,190
catastrophizing person might begin with

338
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:29,290
the thought oh no I'm gonna be late for

339
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:31,330
work and from there and fer my boss is

340
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:33,010
gonna be angry I'm gonna lose my job I'm

341
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:34,630
not gonna be able to get another job I'm

342
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:36,100
gonna be unemployed forever my family

343
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:38,830
will starve oh god we're all gonna die

344
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:40,960
each step in the sequences sort of

345
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:43,090
plausible for the leap from step one to

346
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:44,560
step seven is completely absurd this is

347
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:46,510
exactly how the block pill works

348
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:48,850
you start with experiences of rejection

349
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:50,380
and isolation from there you infer that

350
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:51,700
you are on a tractor to women that you

351
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:53,380
will never be attractive to any woman

352
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:55,180
that you will be forever alone that you

353
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:56,860
will always be unhappy that women did

354
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:58,450
this to you that feminism empowered

355
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:59,830
women to do this to you at the social

356
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:01,510
trends that made this possible are only

357
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:02,890
getting worse the humanity itself is

358
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:04,810
doomed and your only option is to lie

359
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:06,670
down and rot of course not all insults

360
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:09,110
take things quite so far but a lot of

361
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:11,149
them do on in soft forums suicidal

362
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:13,130
is very common and posts are often

363
00:14:11,149 --> 00:14:14,420
tagged to sue a fuel or rope fuel

364
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:16,490
meaning that they make you want to kill

365
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:18,470
yourself usually because the reminders

366
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:20,480
of how hopeless the insel situation is

367
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:21,980
or how devastating it is that in sales

368
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:24,230
are missing out on the incredible bliss

369
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:26,360
of sex and romance now if you suggests

370
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:28,370
to in cells that posting suah fuel on

371
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:30,709
forums already populated by lonely and

372
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:32,870
depressed people is maybe not the most

373
00:14:30,709 --> 00:14:34,940
responsible idea they respond that oh

374
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:36,890
it's just dark humor it's just a cope

375
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:39,050
throw as a bone here but a lot of the

376
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:40,760
suicidal stuff shows no signs of humor

377
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:42,529
and it's common to see people express

378
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:43,790
pretty extreme states of depression

379
00:14:42,529 --> 00:14:46,010
which is not surprising since

380
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:47,870
hopelessness is the logical conclusion

381
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:49,339
of the plot in the world you know once a

382
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:51,680
possibility for happiness is determined

383
00:14:49,339 --> 00:14:53,329
by the genetics of height frame and a

384
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:55,459
facial bone structure and if you don't

385
00:14:53,329 --> 00:14:57,620
have these gifts there's no relief but

386
00:14:55,459 --> 00:14:59,420
to cope a rope now it's pretty tempting

387
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:01,220
to just mom the [ __ ] out of these kids

388
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:03,380
you want to grab them by their black ops

389
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:04,790
t-shirts shake them with it and tell

390
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:05,959
them there are millions of men with

391
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:07,519
small wrists and weak Chin's getting

392
00:15:05,959 --> 00:15:08,930
lead every day but that their own worst

393
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:10,760
enemy is but they need to get off the

394
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:12,829
computer go outside make some friends

395
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:14,300
stop hating women get some hobbies and

396
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:16,459
who knows maybe they'll develop a

397
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:18,230
disposition that women find a little

398
00:15:16,459 --> 00:15:18,949
more approachable essentially you want

399
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:21,230
to tell them

400
00:15:18,949 --> 00:15:22,760
clean your room bucco and fart for the

401
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:24,800
young men in this demographic who are

402
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:26,660
receptive to that kind of advice Jordan

403
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,829
Peterson is probably helpful because

404
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:29,959
he's telling them a lot of what they

405
00:15:27,829 --> 00:15:31,550
need to hear and he's kind of a sexist

406
00:15:29,959 --> 00:15:33,529
old man so they might actually listen

407
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:35,300
but most in cells don't want to hear

408
00:15:33,529 --> 00:15:37,610
this kind of advice in fact they view it

409
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:39,620
as essentially a microaggression you are

410
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:41,269
in effect Chadds planing their

411
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:43,160
oppression to them when you give basic

412
00:15:41,269 --> 00:15:44,839
advice like take a shower be more

413
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:46,970
confident to people who have already

414
00:15:44,839 --> 00:15:48,860
experienced a lifetime of rejection in

415
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:49,940
isolation and who believe if they've

416
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:52,160
already tried everything

417
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:54,500
so they despise this kind of advice and

418
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:56,510
devote endless posts to bitterly mocking

419
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:59,329
the futility and insensitivity of it

420
00:15:56,510 --> 00:16:00,920
just go out to parties brah instead of

421
00:15:59,329 --> 00:16:02,570
hating on women all day why don't you

422
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:05,120
losers just try being confident like

423
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:07,910
this everything good guy confidence is

424
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:09,079
key you in cells need some hobbies try

425
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:11,690
reading some books

426
00:16:09,079 --> 00:16:14,060
women love intelligence it works for me

427
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:18,670
bro oh you just need to get out

428
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:21,350
no one knows what it's like to be hated

429
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:23,600
to in sells their world view seems

430
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:25,010
ironclad it has built-in defenses

431
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,080
against anyone who would try to change

432
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:29,210
their minds so if you want to understand

433
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:30,590
in cells and in particular if you want

434
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:33,200
to understand why their community

435
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:34,940
produces so many mass murderers you have

436
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,800
to understand that the black pill is

437
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:39,200
more than the dogma that you can't get

438
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:41,090
laid it's also the dogma that because

439
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:43,190
you can't get laid you can never be

440
00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:44,780
happy so we have in our hands here is

441
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:47,750
more than a bunch of angry internet

442
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:50,030
misogynists it's at worst a kind of

443
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:52,100
death cult complete with an eternal hell

444
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:54,230
than an omnipotent enemy it is not

445
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:56,150
surprising that that state of mind leads

446
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:59,240
a few of them to conclude that since

447
00:16:56,150 --> 00:17:03,710
triumph is impossible why not try

448
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:05,660
revenge third base tinder is garbage I

449
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:07,550
know I said I wasn't gonna sympathize

450
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:09,470
with in cells and I know they don't want

451
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:11,630
my sympathy anyway and I know it's bad

452
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:14,180
practices to sympathize with the devil

453
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:16,400
but on some level I can't help it the

454
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:17,870
internet is for introverts so I'm sure a

455
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,640
lot of people watching this feel the

456
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:22,430
same way I bet some of you have been

457
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:23,870
this guy I have been this guy so look

458
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:25,670
I'm gonna tell you something I've never

459
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:28,100
really come out about on this channel so

460
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:31,340
this is like a really vulnerable moment

461
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:33,980
for me but I used to live as a man and

462
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:35,660
I'm not proud of that but I'm ready to

463
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:37,670
move on if you're ready to forgive I'm

464
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:40,340
in the unusual situation of being a

465
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:42,740
woman who date's men who used to be a

466
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:44,630
man who date's women what kind of [ __ ]

467
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:47,480
up [ __ ] is that is that even allowed

468
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:49,220
alright cop down lesbians stands I'm

469
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:51,860
still attracted to women and those who

470
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:57,380
lieth betwixt cats the inherent

471
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:59,660
eroticism of the sea yeah don't you just

472
00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:01,730
want to get in there

473
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:03,860
take me money but I have it on a

474
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:05,780
heterosexual kick lately I got to get my

475
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:07,789
edirol on what I'm getting at is I've

476
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:10,549
used tinder both's is a man seeking

477
00:18:07,789 --> 00:18:12,140
women and as a woman seeking men and I

478
00:18:10,549 --> 00:18:14,059
think that gives me some relevant

479
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:15,950
experiences when you're a man

480
00:18:14,059 --> 00:18:18,020
the strategy is you've got to send a lot

481
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:20,510
of messages because women get a lot of

482
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:21,890
messages and then you just got to try to

483
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:24,440
be less of an ogre than the other

484
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:27,380
fuckboys whereas if you're a woman you

485
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:31,130
get to lie recumbent on your shades long

486
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:33,110
and receive the enquiries let's see how

487
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:35,240

rates of them to be interested in me

494
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:58,280

hard if you just be patient it's it's a

500
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:14,450
whole process that's not a [ __ ] that's

501
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:16,039
a [ __ ] hole you'll never know what it's

502
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:20,240
like to squeeze life out of your sacred

503
00:19:16,039 --> 00:19:21,650
passage well that's true I am NOT gonna

504
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,360
be squeezing any life out unless

505
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:24,919
something goes a very seriously wrong

506
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:26,780
and I assure you that none of the

507
00:19:24,919 --> 00:19:28,549
passages I have down there have ever

508
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:30,770
been or ever will be sacred

509
00:19:28,549 --> 00:19:33,799
ah be yellow leave my [ __ ] hole out of

510
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:35,090
this when I first started using this app

511
00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:36,830
I was messaging with a guy who seemed

512
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:38,570
super chill he's gonna take me to a

513
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:41,659
concert I was like seems like a lot for

514
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:43,820
a birthday but we'll try it 15 minutes

515
00:19:41,659 --> 00:19:46,250
after we agreed to that he sends me a

516
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:46,909
message what color panties are you

517
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:53,419
wearing

518
00:19:46,909 --> 00:19:55,280
I would love to smell them can we get

519
00:19:53,419 --> 00:19:57,020
coffee first the hell of it is I

520
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:58,970
probably would have let him smell my

521
00:19:57,020 --> 00:20:01,039
panties but this is the thing you bring

522
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:02,960
up on the third [ __ ] you don't open with

523
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:04,610
panty sniffing like the only point of in

524
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,140
a messaging is for me to figure out if

525
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:07,610
you're gonna murder me and you're

526
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:09,180
already [ __ ] it up so those are the

527
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:11,070
experience of women

528
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:13,260
we're drowning a dick and most of it is

529
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:15,150
terrible not all I do have some very

530
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:17,100
sweet messages and I haven't been using

531
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:18,510
the app in a couple months so if I

532
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:20,460
didn't respond to you or if we didn't

533
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:23,940
match it's not because I rejected you

534
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:25,830
it's because I don't like the app people

535
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:27,750
screenshot my profile and they post it

536
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:30,240
online and they call me khakhra points

537
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:33,840
and out like I was too famous for this

538
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:35,670
[ __ ] my life is hard so girls we do a

539
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:37,620
lot of complaining about the firing

540
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:39,390
squad of bad dicks that's constantly

541
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:41,820
pointed at us in dating apps but how

542
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:44,250
would you feel if instead of it you were

543
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:46,050
just getting radio silence like the N

544
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:49,440
cells get I can't speak for other women

545
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:51,840
but personally I prefer the firing squad

546
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:54,120
of dicks you know at least these pricks

547
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:56,460
care enough about my [ __ ] to be an

548
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:58,530
[ __ ] about my deck I feel sorry for

549
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:59,820
men on dating apps I really do you have

550
00:20:58,530 --> 00:21:01,650
to deal with a lot of rejection and

551
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:03,090
there must be difficult these apps are

552
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:04,680
especially brutal to people who aren't

553
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:06,600
photogenic if you're meeting people at a

554
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,920
bar or a party you might strike up a

555
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:10,020
conversation with someone who you're not

556
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:11,850
initially physically attracted to but

557
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:13,590
then maybe they're super funny or

558
00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:15,480
charming or maybe they're attracted to

559
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:17,940
me and that's an attractive quality and

560
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:20,730
another person that they appreciate how

561
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:22,700
beautiful I am but on tinder you're just

562
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:24,990
browsing a catalogue of faces and

563
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:26,910
gatekeeping who even gets to talk to you

564
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:28,770
in the first place red pillars have a

565
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:31,490
really gross way of talking about dating

566
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:34,170
in terms of sexual market value but like

567
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:35,880
dating kind of is a marketplace or at

568
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:38,040
least you can analyze it like one and

569
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:40,950
her culture is so visual these apps are

570
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:42,150
so picture centered that bone structure

571
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:44,580
like it's not the only thing that

572
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:46,350
matters but it matters a great deal and

573
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:48,900
this is where I do have sympathy for the

574
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:50,310
in cells because as a trans woman I know

575
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:52,710
what it's like to obsess over

576
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:54,240
millimeters of bone I actually have to

577
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:55,560
interrupt work on this video to go to a

578
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:58,680
consultation for facial feminization

579
00:21:55,560 --> 00:22:00,420
surgery so I can pay luxury car amounts

580
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:03,420
of money to shave off a few millimeters

581
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:05,430
of bone hair there because it must needs

582
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:07,230
be remarked that the skull of the female

583
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:09,390
exhibit anthem drawbridge less

584
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:11,310
pronounced I mean I'm just as obsessed

585
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:13,050
with bone structure as the goddamn mint

586
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:14,710
cells because I think certain parts in

587
00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:16,810
my face make me look like a man

588
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:18,970
and I worry about it every day we're all

589
00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:20,620
obsessed with the bones honey we all

590
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:22,480
have bones inside us we all love

591
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:25,630
touching bones you want to take a

592
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:29,110
measurement from the barbell range the

593
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:33,450
lambdoid suture and multiply that figure

594
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:36,610
by pi to calculate when we go the Chad

595
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:38,940
circumference why is no one talking

596
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:41,800
about the Chad circumference fourth base

597
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:44,380
just the tip there's another way I think

598
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:46,180
my experience as a transwoman

599
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:48,550
is relevant to the in cell discussion

600
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:50,710
and that's that I recognize delusional

601
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:52,570
self-loathing when I see it I'm far from

602
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:54,880
the first to point out that the supreme

603
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:56,950
gentleman in cell mass murderer elliot

604
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:59,380
rodger was a partner his narcissistic

605
00:22:56,950 --> 00:23:01,210
psychopath personality an eminently

606
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:03,010
bangable twink and i'm not going to show

607
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:05,350
you pictures of in cells but on their

608
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:07,810
forums they do sometimes post selfie

609
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:10,000
threads and you can't say this on itself

610
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:12,970
forms without enraging them but in

611
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:15,400
confidence from one pretend clinician to

612
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:17,800
another let me tell you that the truth

613
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:20,050
about themselves is that almost all of

614
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:21,970
them are completely normal looking guys

615
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:23,560
but of course that's not the feedback

616
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:25,210
they got it from other in cells the

617
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:26,830
feedback they get is that their chins

618
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:28,030
are weak their hair is thin their skin

619
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:30,460
is garbage and there's no hope

620
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:32,050
whatsoever no woman will ever love them

621
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:33,250
and there are true cells with no option

622
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:35,590
but to lie down in Ron and the

623
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:38,320
interesting thing is those guys post

624
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:39,790
selfies to those threads knowing that's

625
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:43,480
the kind of feedback they're gonna get

626
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:45,580
so why why do they do it well I'll tell

627
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:48,250
you a little story there is a website on

628
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:51,340
the internet called 4chan org that has a

629
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:53,830
board called LGBT a few years ago this

630
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:55,780
was used mainly by the 25 gay men who

631
00:23:53,830 --> 00:24:00,390
actually like Milo innopolis but

632
00:23:55,780 --> 00:24:02,350
recently it's used mostly by men who are

633
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:04,450
entertaining the notion

634
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:06,520
becoming women and by early transition

635
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:09,490
trans women so the board is jokingly

636
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:11,289
called tttt now I've recently moved

637
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:14,559
beyond that first stage of my transition

638
00:24:11,289 --> 00:24:17,130
but the memory is still fresh and let me

639
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:19,330
tell you it is a painful awkward

640
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:22,330
humiliating stage of life so the

641
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:23,770
transfer of tttt are tragic

642
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:25,720
they're basically still in man mode

643
00:24:23,770 --> 00:24:28,360
which is why they're using for sham and

644
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:29,890
I bring them up because they remind me a

645
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:31,840
lot of in cells

646
00:24:29,890 --> 00:24:35,020
for in cells the core frustration is

647
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:37,630
that they can't get laid for tttt if

648
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:39,130
nothing can't pass as female both groups

649
00:24:37,630 --> 00:24:41,559
post selfies knowing they're gonna get

650
00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:43,210
brutal unconstructive feedback and both

651
00:24:41,559 --> 00:24:45,130
groups have a weird vocabulary with

652
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:48,250
which to express their anxieties for

653
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:51,789
instance on tttt a major piece of jargon

654
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:54,190
is hun a slur used by trans women for

655
00:24:51,789 --> 00:24:55,809
other trans women which basically means

656
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:57,640
that you look like a man in a dress

657
00:24:55,809 --> 00:24:58,870
which is what every trans woman is

658
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:01,059
afraid of and there's another

659
00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:03,580
commonality within cells too with all

660
00:25:01,059 --> 00:25:05,590
bigots and self Luthor's which if you've

661
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:08,200
been paying attention you've already

662
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:10,360
guessed you will never be seen as a

663
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:12,880
woman because of your head size have all

664
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:14,380
the surgeries in the world a massive man

665
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:16,750
Nagin will stay the same

666
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:20,020
well this freak thinks he has very soft

667
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:23,049
facial features his head is [ __ ] huge

668
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:24,220
and the huns on reddit are hug boxing

669
00:25:23,049 --> 00:25:33,100
him and telling him that there are women

670
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:34,659
with big heads you transition with the

671
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:36,820
man's head you will be clock you will be

672
00:25:34,659 --> 00:25:40,539
looked at as a freak you will never be

673
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:42,820
seen as a legit one this is why I'm not

674
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:45,520
transitioning Thank You

675
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:48,100
skull people for showing me the way and

676
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:50,679
that no matter what I do I will always

677
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:53,169
be a manly man

678
00:25:50,679 --> 00:25:54,260
Scholl Weiss you saved me the

679
00:25:53,169 --> 00:25:56,750
embarrassment of

680
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:59,210
being a little big-headed manager tears

681
00:25:56,750 --> 00:26:03,020
evidence the cranial vault of the auto

682
00:25:59,210 --> 00:26:06,169
guider file be much more voluminous into

683
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:08,570
the facial plain wider it always comes

684
00:26:06,169 --> 00:26:11,630
back to the skulls every time the other

685
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:13,970
interesting thing about tttt is eyes to

686
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:15,710
get posted there a lot for a while I had

687
00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:17,870
some stands on the ward who basically

688
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:20,030
viewed me as inspiration

689
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:22,220
yikes because of course that kind of

690
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:24,260
post is frowned upon if I'm not looked

691
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:27,640
at as a big scold me on freak if my

692
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:30,440
transition is going well that means that

693
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:32,570
some of their transitions might be able

694
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:34,970
to and that is an unacceptable

695
00:26:32,570 --> 00:26:37,130
conclusion for a community founded on

696
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:38,809
self-loathing and hopelessness so it was

697
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:40,760
necessary for the rest of the board to

698
00:26:38,809 --> 00:26:42,740
explain what I didn't pass why I would

699
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:44,150
never pass why anyone who looked less

700
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:45,890
good than me shouldn't even [ __ ]

701
00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:47,840
think about it we shouldn't transition

702
00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:49,730
at all they should just repress they

703
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,840
should lie down in rock and I used to

704
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:53,090
read the stuff all the time

705
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:55,750
like I was specifically seek on threads

706
00:26:53,090 --> 00:26:58,429
about me which might seem strange

707
00:26:55,750 --> 00:27:00,230
considering I had hundreds of fans

708
00:26:58,429 --> 00:27:02,870
telling you is a gorgeous goddess every

709
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:05,240
day so why did I turn away from that to

710
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:07,400
intentionally seek out this dismal den

711
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:09,350
of Huns talking about how my giant Han

712
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:11,540
skull is claw Keable at a thousand paces

713
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:14,150
and my voice sounds like a ridiculous

714
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:16,640
Muppet falsetto hybrid of Mickey Mouse

715
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:18,500
and Winnie the Pooh well basically there

716
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:20,299
was part of my brain that just simply

717
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:22,730
refused to believe it when people told

718
00:27:20,299 --> 00:27:25,160
me I was gorgeous and first semi

719
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:26,780
plausible reasons a lot of trans people

720
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:28,610
in the internet tell other trans people

721
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:30,260
they look gorgeous no matter what they

722
00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:35,690
look like that's where the word Han

723
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:37,760
comes from you let gray hun so a tttt is

724
00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:40,070
saying about reddit hog boxing is true

725
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:42,950
to some extent there is a kind of a

726
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:45,200
priori and dogmatic flattery that

727
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:47,540
prevails in some trans spaces so I came

728
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:49,820
to regard all compliments as everyone is

729
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:52,070
beautiful politically correct cuckoldry

730
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:54,620
and there would be this thrill of going

731
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:56,390
to tttt and reading other people saying

732
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:59,450
when my deepest anxieties told me was

733
00:27:56,390 --> 00:28:01,820
really true and that was always painful

734
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:02,720
but there was a kind of pleasure - there

735
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:04,430
was a rush

736
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,960
it's exciting to burst out of the

737
00:28:04,430 --> 00:28:07,790
politically correct bubble and say what

738
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:09,470
you're really thinking that personality

739
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:11,330
doesn't matter because big scold chad's

740
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:13,010
get all the girls the Contra points is a

741
00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:15,620
big scold hunt with a voice like nails

742
00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:17,450
on a chalkboard and at first I justified

743
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:19,850
the habit by telling myself I was just

744
00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:21,770
doing research I have to keep tabs and

745
00:28:19,850 --> 00:28:24,020
what the bigots are saying it's simply

746
00:28:21,770 --> 00:28:25,880
my job but soon I realized it wasn't

747
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:27,980
just research and it was infecting me

748
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:31,850
away from the computer this ridiculous

749
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:34,250
vocabulary puns AGP was popping up in my

750
00:28:31,850 --> 00:28:35,870
head unexpected times it was starting to

751
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:38,210
color how I thought about myself and

752
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:40,070
worse it was starting to infect how I

753
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:42,200
thought about other trans women and

754
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:43,610
that's the moment I realized I need to

755
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:45,680
stop looking at this stuff right now or

756
00:28:43,610 --> 00:28:47,300
I'm gonna become a monster and once that

757
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:49,250
happens it's gonna be very difficult to

758
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:50,720
fix this is exactly how the in sell

759
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:52,850
black pill works there's something

760
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:54,230
infectious about these vocabularies like

761
00:28:52,850 --> 00:28:56,930
on days I've been working on this video

762
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:58,910
I'll go out at night and these words

763
00:28:56,930 --> 00:29:01,010
just didn't volunteer ilish oh up in my

764
00:28:58,910 --> 00:29:02,960
thoughts that bartender is such a Chad

765
00:29:01,010 --> 00:29:05,120
he's totally height walking that tiny

766
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:06,350
[ __ ] and the tragic thing is some in

767
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,940
sales don't realize it what this is

768
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:09,320
doing to their minds until it's too late

769
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:13,190
let's face it

770
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:15,890
black pills are silly fuel a lot of us

771
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:17,270
can't handle them i gleefully indulged

772
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:19,010
in this sub red at the moment I

773
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:21,050
discovered it since I loved uncovering

774
00:29:19,010 --> 00:29:25,490
secrets that society had been hiding

775
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:29,120
from me but it has affected my mental

776
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:30,980
health in a bad way I made my first call

777
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:33,560
to the suicide hotline a few weeks ago

778
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:35,660
and I've never needed to do that before

779
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:39,940
I could always talk myself out of it

780
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:42,530
through logic but my mind is ruined now

781
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:45,320
this is a form of what psychologists are

782
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:47,090
calling digital self-harm prototypically

783
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:49,010
teens who leave themselves abusive

784
00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:50,900
comments from sock puppet accounts but

785
00:29:49,010 --> 00:29:52,820
the more sophisticated adult version of

786
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:54,530
this involves intentionally seeking out

787
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:56,990
abusive and disparaging comments about

788
00:29:54,530 --> 00:29:58,790
yourself made by other people I have a

789
00:29:56,990 --> 00:30:00,320
long history of doing this intentionally

790
00:29:58,790 --> 00:30:02,870
looking for a piece of comments

791
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:06,629
especially once that cut to the core of

792
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:09,269
my deepest insecurities and fears why I

793
00:30:06,629 --> 00:30:11,009
why do people cut themselves part of it

794
00:30:09,269 --> 00:30:14,519
is what we could call masochistic

795
00:30:11,009 --> 00:30:16,440
epistemology whatever hurts is true I've

796
00:30:14,519 --> 00:30:17,970
recently gotten much better about this I

797
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:21,059
haven't been to any of the worst places

798
00:30:17,970 --> 00:30:23,820
in a couple months and my mental health

799
00:30:21,059 --> 00:30:25,379
is much improved so insults I'm not

800
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:27,029
going to respond to your worldview like

801
00:30:25,379 --> 00:30:28,830
it's an intellectual position or the of

802
00:30:27,029 --> 00:30:30,509
rational debate because these ideas and

803
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:32,610
arguments you're not using them the way

804
00:30:30,509 --> 00:30:34,289
rational people use arguments you're

805
00:30:32,610 --> 00:30:36,299
using them as razor blades to abuse

806
00:30:34,289 --> 00:30:37,889
yourselves and I know because I've done

807
00:30:36,299 --> 00:30:40,049
the exact same thing the insult

808
00:30:37,889 --> 00:30:42,090
worldview is catastrophizing it's an

809
00:30:40,049 --> 00:30:44,549
anxious death spiral and the solution to

810
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:46,379
that has to be therapeutic not logical a

811
00:30:44,549 --> 00:30:48,269
lot of you are lonely you've been

812
00:30:46,379 --> 00:30:50,369
bullied and neglected you feel left

813
00:30:48,269 --> 00:30:51,720
behind by society but what you're doing

814
00:30:50,369 --> 00:30:54,269
when you're reading in cell forums is

815
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:55,980
you're slowly internalizing a cruel and

816
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:57,509
distorted way of looking at yourselves

817
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:59,879
and to other people in your situation

818
00:30:57,509 --> 00:31:01,350
and at women and you're forming mental

819
00:30:59,879 --> 00:31:02,759
habits that are gonna make it very

820
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:04,950
difficult for you to live a happy life

821
00:31:02,759 --> 00:31:07,559
so what you have to do is get off those

822
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:09,059
forums as fast as possible I'm going to

823
00:31:07,559 --> 00:31:11,549
post a link in the description of this

824
00:31:09,059 --> 00:31:13,230
video to instructions on how to block

825
00:31:11,549 --> 00:31:17,669
certain websites from your computer

826
00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:22,200
because for me that's what it took fifth

827
00:31:17,669 --> 00:31:24,570
base anal so the innocent reddit

828
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:27,240
transgender 4chan analogy has a limit

829
00:31:24,570 --> 00:31:29,309
and that limit is that for a significant

830
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:31,590
subset of the insel community their

831
00:31:29,309 --> 00:31:34,769
primary hatred is not directed at

832
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:35,510
themselves but at women and they really

833
00:31:34,769 --> 00:31:37,550
hate

834
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:39,680
like I'm basically a professional

835
00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:40,790
Internet bigotry scholar at this point I

836
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:42,890
look at this kind of stuff all the time

837
00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:44,900
but researching this video I was

838
00:31:42,890 --> 00:31:47,120
honestly kind of shocked at the

839
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:49,190
intensity of misogyny on himself forums

840
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:51,350
I won't show the worst of it but we're

841
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:53,180
talking women for rape saying they

842
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:55,160
deserve to be raped calls for

843
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:57,680
state-mandated girlfriends and sex

844
00:31:55,160 --> 00:32:01,250
slaves but most of all just kind of

845
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:06,380
generalized misinformed rage I hate

846
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:09,080
women I really do every time I look at

847
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:11,240
my blood pressure shoots through the

848
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:13,700
roof when they're gabbing on the cell

849
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:15,830
phone about Paris Hilton when they're

850
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:18,170
adjusting their lipstick and taking up

851
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:20,540
my time rifling through their stupid

852
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:23,030
purse when they whined to me about their

853
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:24,920
period when they believe they're on and

854
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:27,110
on about some artists film director

855
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:29,270
musician nobody gives a flippin [ __ ]

856
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:32,120
about when they cry and expect your

857
00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:34,160
personal sympathy but most of all I hate

858
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:37,460
them because their smug hyperactive

859
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:39,230
little [ __ ] made that way by our

860
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:42,230
[ __ ] society

861
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:45,230
look what uncontrolled feminism and the

862
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:46,670
media has died Stacy it's Tracy what was

863
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:48,650
it the mall the other day with Amber

864
00:32:46,670 --> 00:32:51,410
Heather Jenna and Trish and we were

865
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:54,500
talking about Paris Hilton a very

866
00:32:51,410 --> 00:32:56,150
relevant cultural figure in 2018 they

867
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:57,500
live in this cartoon caricature world

868
00:32:56,150 --> 00:32:59,390
where it's easy to avoid thinking of

869
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:01,250
women is fully human and that's where my

870
00:32:59,390 --> 00:33:03,230
sympathy runs dry because this kind of

871
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:03,950
hatred just needs a spark to turn to

872
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:05,960
violence

873
00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:07,460
soin Souls I know you're not gonna

874
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:08,810
listen to anything I say and you're just

875
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:11,630
gonna say that I'm a [ __ ] and a [ __ ]

876
00:33:08,810 --> 00:33:13,310
and a degenerate and to that I say how

877
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:15,500
dare you say things that are entirely

878
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:17,120
true but also of also if you would have

879
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:18,560
[ __ ] and I know you don't listen to

880
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,670
suggestions about how you probably

881
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:22,010
actually could have healthy

882
00:33:19,670 --> 00:33:23,540
relationships so no one can really reach

883
00:33:22,010 --> 00:33:25,310
you until you get out of those forums

884
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:27,050
and allow yourselves to be reached but

885
00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:28,880
by way of a closing remark I guess I

886
00:33:27,050 --> 00:33:30,830
simply invite you to consider that you

887
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:32,780
don't even need a warm body or a sex

888
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:35,240
robot to satisfied the erotic longing

889
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:37,610
you know when I was your age in 1975

890
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:38,880
every teenage boy had a Stratocaster in

891
00:33:37,610 --> 00:33:40,740
his bedroom

892
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:43,050
that was the outlet for his sexual

893
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:44,790
frustration what I'm suggesting is the

894
00:33:43,050 --> 00:33:47,070
manosphere exists because rock-and-roll

895
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:49,170
is dead but there's other options

896
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:54,210
think about the eroticism of a rain

897
00:33:49,170 --> 00:33:58,440
storm the clap of thunder the rustle of

898
00:33:54,210 --> 00:34:07,110
the leaves the steam rising off the warm

899
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:10,320
pavement and whether you're a Chad a

900
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:13,170
Stacey and n cell or a hun you could

901
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:17,100
always return to the caress of our dark

902
00:34:13,170 --> 00:34:21,020
mother the see who's salty embrace and

903
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:22,520
develops every contour of your naked

904
00:34:21,020 --> 00:35:01,010
body

905
00:34:22,520 --> 00:35:05,290
[Music]

906
00:35:01,010 --> 00:35:05,290
whoa is it hot in here or is it just me
